11&It is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times.":::"Some people prefer to change jobs several times rather than to work at the same company for a long time. <del>Because</del> People who change jobs many time<ins>s</ins> can get more <ins>of a </ins>variety <ins>of </ins>experience<ins>s</ins>. However, I think that it is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times. There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that you can move up the company ladder. The other reason is that you can develop <ins>a</ins> strong relationship with your <mod target = companion>co-workers</mod>.<br><br>First of all, I believe that if you stay with a company for several years, you have the opportunity to be promoted more quickly. This is an excellent boost for one`s career since with every promotion you are learning something new about the company and you can get respect from your co<ins>-</ins>workers. And this experience can help you to advance <mod target = in>to a higher</mod> rank. In addition, if you transfer to <mod target = other>another</mod> department or <mod target = other>another</mod> company, you can bring the knowledge <ins>you</ins> learned <mod target = from>through</mod> the process of <ins>your</ins> promotion.<br><br>Second<ins>ly</ins>, staying with one job over a long period of time offers you the opportunity to develop<del>ing</del> strong relationship<ins>s</ins> with your <mod target = companion>co-workers</mod>. Sometimes, we can communicate or eat lunch with <mod target = companion>our co-workers </mod>rather than our family because we spend a lot of time <del>on</del> working <mod target = in>at</mod> the company. Then you can have a chance to share your<mod target =  living life>personal life</mod> or idea<ins>s</ins> about the business with your co<ins>-</ins>worker<ins>s</ins>. It can make <del>that</del> you feel a sense of fellowship. And since you have built strong bonds with others, it may also put you in a unique position to help your co<ins>-</ins>workers. You can give your <mod target = companion>co-workers</mod> better advices to solve the problem<ins>s </ins>because you usually <mod target = have>spend</mod> a lot of <del>talking</del> time <ins>talking</ins> with <mod target = your coworkers>them</mod>.<br><br>In conclusion, working at the same company for a long time give<ins>s</ins> you the opportunity to be promoted more quickly and also offer<ins>s </ins>the opportunity to develop<del>ing</del> strong bonds with your co-workers. For these reasons, I feel that it is better to stay with one job for a long time.":::

""15&In order to stay well-informed, people should get information from various news sources.""":::"It is evident that in our current society, getting news from a variety of media <ins>outlets </ins>has tremendous importance in our lives and it is <ins>a</ins> common <mod target = thing>practice</mod>.

Firstly, different view <mod target = of>from</mod> many sources <mod target = is>are</mod> confusing.

While there, I was highly shocked by the large number of people who were suffering from starvation and AIDS.  Naturally I <mod target = become>began</mod> to <mod target = have>take an</mod> interest <mod target = about>in</mod> <ins>the</ins> problem of poverty in Africa <del>countries</del>.

In contrast, other news said that their government<ins>s</ins> cannot afford to support their nation<ins>s</ins>, and serious poverty is caused by not enough aid from advanced countries. Therefore, after I saw these sources, I could not <mod target = know>understand </mod>the real truth and <ins>became </ins>confused due to the totally different information.

Let me explain my case that can support my claim. When I was in high school, I had to submit <ins>a</ins> report about global warming in the class. I was eager<del>ly</del> in that class, so <ins>I</ins> thought that getting lots of information <mod target = is>was the</mod> best way to <mod target = know>understand</mod> the issue.

In this sense, we can definitely notice that if we obtain information from many new sources, we cannot totally understand all of it. <br><br>As mentioned above regarding the issue, I think people are not able to stay well informed when they get information from many news media <ins>outlets</ins> for <ins>the</ins> following reasons. <ins>The </ins>first reason is that people are confused by different information from <ins>a</ins> variety of news sources.

This simple and quick escape from the reality can serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. On the other hand, reading a book can stress people due to its complex and profound contents. According to a study conducted by the department of education of Seoul National University of Korea in 2007, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing academic pressure. Students in Group A exercised regularly and cooperated with each other <mod target = in>with</mod> playing sports but those in Group B rarely engaged in such activities and just read <del>a </del>book<ins>s</ins> in their rooms.

Also, as modern society is increasingly specialized and competitive, today's job markets require job candidates with such qualities. According to the Ministry of employment of Korea in 2004, the employment interview was the most pivotal component in hiring practice<ins>s</ins>, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call.  The interviewers looked at the applicant's knowledge and skill, mostly related to <ins>their </ins>specialty.

In this essay, I will present two reasons to support my idea.<br><br>            To begin with, music and art classes can help children enjoy considerably fertile lives when they are grown up. Specifically, to appreciate a high level of music and painting can play a significant role in making people keep stable minds and have much vibrant lives. In addition, people who have received art or music <mod target = education>class</mod> are able to express their emotions and feelings in <del>a </del>more various and effective way<ins>s</ins>.

75&The opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people.":::"A large number of people might assert that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to older people than to younger people. Contrary to <del>the </del>popular belief, I agree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people for the following two reasons: benefiting recruitment, and relieving stress.<br>               To begin with, the opinions of celebrities are more crucial and influential to young people than to older people as <mod target = understanding>noticing</mod> <del>the </del>opinions guarantees success in <ins>people's </ins>career<ins>s</ins>. This is due to the fact that the when people listen<del>s</del> to the talk of celebrities, they can understand the social issues very effectively because the celebrities usually appear<del>s</del> <mod target = on various>to variety of</mod> media and express their thoughts. Moreover, as modern society is becoming increasingly globalized and competitive, today's job market<del>s</del> require<ins>s</ins> <del>a </del>job candidate<ins>s</ins> <mod target = that can>with such quality to</mod> comprehend social issues.  In addition<ins>,</ins> as most <del>of </del>young people need to get a job, while older people most likely <del>to </del>already have occupations, the importance and <del>the </del>effect of the opinions of celebrities are bigger to young people. According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2009, the employment interview was the most important component in the hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at the job <mod target = applicants'>applicant's</mod> knowledge and skills, mostly related to social issues such as terrorism or warfare.<br>              Furthermore, the point of views of famous people <mod target = are>is</mod> more vital and powerful to <ins>the </ins>younger generation as the views enable younger people to release more stress. This is attributed to the fact that listening to the<ins>ir</ins> opinions can make people <del>to </del>release their stress when the opinion matches <mod target = their>with</mod> own. And<del>,</del> young people tend to have more stress than older people as they <del>more </del>suffer<del>s</del> from <ins>more </ins>recruitment problem<ins>s</ins>, financial problem<ins>s</ins>, and social problems. Therefore, young people are more affected by the<ins>ir</ins> opinions as they have more stress to let off. According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2005, there was a significant difference between two groups of people in managing their pressure.

If <ins>the </ins>government make<ins>s</ins> public transportation free, the number of people who drive<del>s</del> their own car<ins>s</ins> will decrease. As a result, air pollution caused by car emission<ins>s</ins> will be reduced and <ins>the </ins>air will be <mod target = cleaner.

However, I disagree with this statement and sincerely believe that the more sources of information <mod target = a person>the one</mod> explores, the more valid, useful, and helpful knowledge he gets.

In addition, elementary students in Switzerland visit<del>ed</del> parks or amusement park<ins>s</ins> at least four times in a year.

This indicates that teachers' ability to relate well to students helps students <del>to </del>get less stress.<br><br>        Furthermore, a faculty member's ability to relate well to students is more critical than the other ability to confer their information to students since the first ability <mod target = helps>renders</mod> students <del>to </del>study with higher efficiency.

132&All high school students are required to study a foreign launguage.":::"There are different opinions among people regarding whether a foreign language course should be included in <ins>the </ins>curricula<del>r</del> of all high school<ins>s</ins>. Although some people argue that high school students can reap benefits focusing on other academic subjects<del>,</del> such as science or math, I totally believe that <ins>the </ins>advantages that students can have by learning a foreign language outweigh<ins>s the</ins> disadvantages. In this essay, I will present reasonable reasons to support my idea.<br>            <br>To begin with, as the world is getting <mod target = more and more connected>closer and closer</mod>, learning a foreign language is a great <mod target = attribute>attribution</mod> to <mod target = help succeed>success</mod> in <mod target = one's>ones'</mod> life. To specify<del> this</del>, students are likely to meet a number of those who are from other <mod target = countries>country</mod> when <mod target = going>making</mod> out into the real world and <mod target = working>have</mod> a job in <ins>the </ins>days to come. In order to become much more competitive, certain amounts of knowledge that students study <mod target = as part of>from</mod> their major is not enough. This is because <ins>the </ins>lack of ability to speak <ins>a </ins>second language may deprive a person of chances to show his or her great performances in the field<del>s</del>. Therefore, high school<ins>s</ins> are required to attempt to encourage students to get used to a foreign language to a certain extent. For instance, my high school <mod target = has a>have</mod> magnificent language programs to encourage students to improve their English or Japanese. My friends tried to study very hard to become proficient in both a second language and academic subjects. As a result, those who are equipped with an advanced level of language are now showing <del>a </del>great performance<ins>s</ins> in their field<ins>s</ins> and enjoying their successful lives. In this regard, a foreign language learned in high school is considerably helpful for students' future<ins>s</ins>. <br><br>On top of that, it seems that <mod target = university>high school</mod> students will not have sufficient time to study and get involved in a foreign language course because they have to spend their time reading their major books and doing assignments<del> in university</del>. To specify<del> this</del>, some people can say that <mod target = universities>university</mod> have diverse education programs associated with teaching a second language. However, it is likely that university students are so busy with their major that they do not have <del>a </del>room to concentrate <mod target = on>in</mod> a second language course. For example, when <del>being </del>asked about studying a foreign language, every university student said that they try to take part in that kind of class, but cannot help but go to the library to study their major. Therefore, high school should take <mod target = the>an</mod> appropriate action to give students chances to <mod target = explore>exploring</mod> a foreign language that they have wanted to learn. Probably, for them, high school <del>life </del>is a last chance to indulge themselves with learning a second language, so they need to receive a foreign language class, even if it is a basic course.<br>            <br>To sum up, it is essential for every high school student to study how to speak and read a foreign language because not only can they become much more competitive with <ins>the </ins>ability to talk to foreign people but also because they do not have enough time to study it when they are in university. In conclusion, all high school<ins>s</ins> should provide a foreign language course for students' bright future<ins>s</ins>.<br><br>":::

137&It is better to choose a university whose graduates have good job opportunities than a university who has famous professors.":::"Getting a fine job is hard today since the population of the world is swiftly increasing. In order to get a job, many students attend a university whose graduates have good job opportunities. On the other hand, it might seem like pursuing idealism but it is better to choose a university who has famous professors because students can <ins>be </ins>guarantee<ins>d</ins> <ins>a </ins>high quality of education, and studying under renown<ins>ed</ins> professors gradually help<ins>s</ins> students to get <del>a </del>job<ins>s</ins>.  <br>          <br>Students should choose a university with famous professors since they can <mod target = get>have</mod> high quality <del>of </del>education<ins>s</ins>. A true education is <mod target = receiving high quality information>acknowledging the information with high quality</mod>, and this knowledge will allow them to be <del>a </del>wise<del> person</del>. Moreover, famous professors are famous for at least one reason. In fact, most of them are famous for their teaching skills, and leading students to be open-minded. Furthermore, many renowned professors are famous for stimulating students, leading students to <mod target = get>have a</mod> true education<ins>s</ins>, and make sure their students do not study<del>ing</del> just to have job opportunities. For example, I once had a chance to audit a lecture <mod target = by>of</mod> Chul Soo Ahn, who is well-known for inventing <ins>a </ins>vaccine for computers and disseminating it for free, when he was a professor in KAIST. I only audited two hours of <ins>the </ins>lecture, but it was <mod target = so>very</mod> impressive and moving that it made me <ins>want </ins>to invent various vaccine programs, not for money but to have a positive <ins>effect on the </ins>world. Likewise, famous professors allow students to do something they are majoring in, not <mod target = wasting>ruining</mod> money and time in a university like many other students. <br>              <br>Finally, it is better for a student to choose a university who has renowned professors since studying under renown<ins>ed</ins> professors would gradually lead to <del>have </del>job opportunities.

Many teenagers think about what they are going to eat next, but it is not because they do not have any food left, but it is because they have too much to choose from.

In many cases, even <ins>if </ins>they know <del>the fact </del>that their friends are good at the subject, they get help from a professional tutor because they believe tutors are better than the students. However, it is better for students to ask their friends for help when they need help since students <mod target = are easier>know the best way to be easy</mod> to understand, <ins>the </ins>person who needs help would feel free to ask questions, and they can prompt each other to study more diligently. <br><br>People should ask their friends for help when they need extra help <mod target = with>in</mod> schoolwork because their friends would know the best way to be understood.

For example, when I was in high school, I <del>was </del>could not understand the concept of algebra. Whenever I asked my teacher for help, he just <mod target = referred me to>told me the way</mod> the formula and <mod target = explained how>the way</mod> to solve the problem, using difficult words.

I <mod target = was>could</mod> then <ins>able to </ins>understand the concept and <ins>the </ins>ways to solve the problem because my friend and I had <ins>the </ins>same <mod target = perspective on>eye level of looking at</mod> the concept. This is only my experience but likewise, people could easily understand the material when they ask their friends for help. <br><br>People would feel free to ask all <ins>the </ins>questions they do not understand if they ask friend<ins>s</ins> for help. In Asian countries<ins>,</ins> including my country, it is rude to say bad things <mod target = even if>although</mod> it is true.

In a research, students said that, when they ask <mod target = friends for>an</mod> extra help<del> to friends</del>, they feel free to ask all <ins>the </ins>questions and ask them repeatedly if they do not understand <del>when they do not understand </del>the concepts their friends explained. In contrast, <mod target = the research>they</mod> suggest<ins>ed</ins> that it is more awkward to ask their teachers for help. <br><br>Finally, it is better to get <del>an </del>extra help in schoolwork from friend<ins>s</ins> because students can prompt each other to study more diligently.

Also, there are many campaigns <mod target = to>for</mod> change <ins>the </ins>behavior of individuals.<br><br>To begin with, if a person <mod target = engages in>behave</mod> eco-friendly activities which look<del>s</del> beneficial or interesting, other people may <mod target = mirror>follow</mod> such <mod target = activities.

This is attributed to the fact that people tend to take actions which are beneficial to themselves. This reminds me of my eco-project which I took when I was a university student<mod target = .>,</mod> The project was comprised of simple rules: if a person <mod target = engaged in>behaved</mod> eco-friendly activities <ins>and </ins>then took photos and sent <ins>them to </ins>me<del> them</del>, I gave them <mod target = an ""eco-point,"">'eco-point'</mod> which can be used as money <mod target = at>for</mod> my garage sale.

173&Parents should not allow their children to watch television so that they can do well at school.":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not parents should <del>not </del>allow their children to watch television so that they can do well <ins>in </ins>school. The answer to this question can <mod target = vary>very</mod> greatly depending on individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that parents <ins>should </ins>let children <del>to </del>watch television. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, by watching television, children can relieve overwhelming stress. Second, children <ins>can </ins>grow closer to their friends by sharing <del>the </del>information after watching television.     <br><br>First, children can find relief by watching television and thus they can concentrate on their <mod target = studies>study</mod> in school. These days, children suffer from high<mod target =  >-</mod>levels of stress caused by studying overtime.

In this respect, watching television is a great stress-reliever, which helps children <del>can </del>study well in school. To illustrate <ins>this point </ins>further<del> this point</del>, let me use <ins>the case of my brother </ins>as an example<del> the case of my brother</del>.

For a short time, my brother seems to forget about <ins>the </ins>problems he has <del>had </del>at school and gains enough breathing space to look forward to studying the next day. <mod target = This illustrates that>As a result,</mod> parents should encourage their children to watch television.<br><br>Second, children are able to become closer to their friends, which helps children <del>can </del>study better in school. In today's competitive society, it is difficult to forge strong ties with <del>their </del>friends. <mod target = As>Aa</mod> a result, they may feel isolation not only from family, but also friends. In this context, watching television can help children <del>to </del>combat these social trends by enabling individual<ins>s</ins> to have fun with others. According to the Korean Gallup Poll, most <del>of </del>surveyed respondents indicated that watching television is a great way to strengthen <ins>their relationships </ins>with friends. The respondents said that they are able to laugh <del>out </del>together and talk about performances afterward. Indeed, children can overcome awkwardness that may exist not only among strangers, but also among acquaintances, which will be invaluable to children because they can adjust well in school. Therefore, parents should not prevent children <mod target = from>to</mod> watch<ins>ing</ins> television.  <br>   <br>In conclusion, I strongly argue my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. Thus, <ins>though </ins>the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that the two <del>of my </del>rationales above are sufficiently convincing en<del>c</del>ough to the represent <del>to </del>the viewpoint<ins>s</ins> of a majority of people who are <ins>in </ins>favor <mod target = of>in</mod> my claim.<br><br>":::

People cannot live without planning because they would never know what will happen in the future.

To do this, people should learn what will happen if they behave in a certain way, and make <del>a </del>plan<ins>s</ins> to achieve a goal. Games teach us the ability to make <del>a </del>plan<ins>s</ins>. For example, in a chess game, players should be prudent when they make <del>a </del>decision<ins>s</ins>, because one mere mistake can bring serious problems which can lead to <mod target = loss>lose</mod>.

In our society, there are many rules which people should follow and children need to learn those. They do not know the importance of rules yet because they are still young. Their parents and teacher<ins>s</ins> can teach rules and their importance by words, but this is not enough<ins>,</ins> because its impact is weak and <mod target = this method>its way</mod> is boring to children. One way to teach them rules is games. For instance, children love to play games and they are eager to achieve their goal in a game. By playing games, children <mod target = start to understand that>get to know</mod> they should behave in a certain way when playing games, because they cannot achieve their goal by not following the rule<ins>s</ins>. They <ins>can </ins>also <del>can </del>learn what the result will be if they <mod target = violate>violent</mod> the rule<ins>s</ins> because they will <del>be </del>receive a penalty for their <mod target = violations>violenting</mod>. In this way, children can <ins>learn </ins>the importance of rules naturally. <br>         <br>In conclusion, there are several advantages <mod target = to>in</mod> games. First <del>one </del>is that people can <mod target = develop>raise</mod> their ability to make <mod target = strategies>a strategy</mod> in life because games require that ability.

189&Some people live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a bit city. Which Place world you prefer to live in? Use Specific reasons and details to support your answer.":::"Some people prefer to live in a small town<del>,</del> because of beautiful landscape<ins>s</ins> <del>of nature </del>and clean air, while others prefer to live in a big city. In my opinion, I advocate that living in a big city is better because it gives me numerous opportunities for my life. My reasons for this are that I can get high<ins>er</ins> quality education and huge public transportation. I will explain them below. <br><br>First of all, a big city provides various educational <mod target = opportunities>chances</mod>  <del>going </del>through diverse experiences. A big city has many universities of high quality and professors who received higher education<ins>s</ins>. The universities give me a valuable and meaningful education <mod target = which helps>and then It is good for</mod> me to focus on research. In addition, living in a big city helps people to acquire a variety of experiences. <mod target = Many students can enhance their studies>It is useful to study for many students</mod> by visiting many educational places in a big city such as movie theater<ins>s</ins>, historical<ins> sites</ins>, art museum<ins>s,</ins> and opera house<ins>s</ins>. <mod target = They>It</mod> can learn history, music, <ins>and </ins>biology.

Practically<ins>,</ins> New York University uses all of Ma<ins>n</ins>hattan city <mod target = as a>for</mod> campus <mod target = for>to</mod> their education. If you <mod target = live>living</mod> in a big city, you can receive high qua<del>i</del>lity education <del>preciously </del>and <del>you can </del>use all the facilities of <ins>a </ins>big city for your study.   <br><br>Secondly, a big city offers a wide range of public transportation. Public transportation is convenient <mod target = for>to</mod> our busy daily <mod target = lives>life</mod>. Usually<ins>,</ins> most people commute to school or <mod target = work>company</mod> by train<del>,</del> <ins>or </ins>bus every<del> </del>day. Public transportation can shorten commuting time a lot. A big city has <mod target = better>gigantic</mod> public transportation <del>more </del>than a small town. For instance, I studied for seven months in <ins>a </ins>small town <mod target = in>of</mod> New Zealand three years ago. When I studied there I did not have a car. I had a difficult time going to school. <mod target = But after>After</mod> I moved to Auckland<ins>,</ins> <mod target = which>that</mod> is the biggest city <mod target = in>of</mod> New Zealand, <del>however, </del>I <mod target = was able to>could</mod> commute to school so <mod target = easily>easy</mod> everyday by <ins>public </ins>transportation. The buses came <ins>to </ins>my home frequently<ins>,</ins> at intervals of 15 minutes. Therefore, it was more handy for me to commute to school. Transportation was important to my daily life. It provided a comfortable way to go to school, <ins>the </ins>shopping mall<ins>,</ins> and anywhere<ins> else</ins>. Moreover, you can save <ins>more of </ins>your valuable time <ins>living in a big city </ins>than <del>living </del>in a small town<ins>,</ins> thanks to public transportation. Today, gas prices <mod target = are>is</mod> rising gradually. In this regard, using public transportation instead of <del>using </del>car<ins>s</ins> can <mod target = reduce>save</mod> our cost of living. For instance, <mod target = when>When</mod> we move <mod target = somewhere>anywhere</mod> <mod target = and>if we</mod> buy metro <mod target = Unlimited>Umlimited</mod> ti<ins>c</ins>kets<ins>,</ins> it is <mod target = more economically efficient>bring more economic fares</mod>.

In these circumstances, if you <mod target = live>living</mod> in a big city, you can make your life more efficient and convenient.   <br><br>In conclusion, I support the idea that living in a big city is better than living in a small city.

Moreover, living in a big city <mod target = provides>gives us</mod> profitable public transportation. It can make life more beneficial and fascinating in terms of time and cost efficiency.

This is because most of <mod target = working>the work</mod> in the kitchen is done by convenient appliences; for example, previously people had to boil rice on the stove before eating it.

There are many arguments to support my position, but the two main reasons are stated and explained in detail below.<br><br>Most importantly, parents today have a greater influence on their children than they did the past. This is because, recently, parents can help children to develop their talents by observing them close at hand. Today, young people lead highly scheduled lives as the world becomes more competitive and fast-paced than ever. As a result, they can miss chances to stumble on the fields they actually desire to study. This explains the need for parents' involvement in honing children's talents and potential that might have been buried for many years. Referring to a study conducted by Stanford University, experts now argue that students who have <ins>a </ins>close connection with their parents not only choose the correct path at an early age but also develop their true potential holistically. Actually, most surveyed respondents stated that they might have wasted much time if it had not been for <ins>their </ins>parents' counseling and assistance during their early years. <br><br>In addition, nowadays<del>,</del> parents' influence on young people is become more important than ever. This is attributed to the fact that parents can guide today's children to become model citizens by teaching <ins>them</ins> important life lessons. Generally, students are immature and fallible day by day, and<mod target =  at such time>as such</mod><del>,</del> parents must teach them societal values and <del>thus</del> lend a helping hand in directing them to become useful members of society. Thus, parents play a significant role in children's growth today. For instance, young students may feel tempted to succumb to drugs, especially these days where students can easily <mod target = get in touch with it>them</mod>. Since they lack <del>enough</del> experience, they are likely to consider following the wrong path. However, if young people ask for the help of their parents, they can learn how to fix their moral standards and match the societal values they learned about to real-life circumstances. Through such guidance, young people can resist the temptation of taking drugs and thus grow up as good citizens. <br><br>Due to these reason, my argument is worthy of being supported regardless of its logical flaws. Indeed, the role of older people such as parents<del>,</del> <ins>and </ins>teachers should not be overlooked, but rather be highly regarded over time.<br><br>":::

A single student would only need a pair of uniforms to wear <mod target = in>to</mod> his school and he <mod target = won't>wouldn't</mod> have to pay extra cash for other clothes.

However, I firmly support the idea that parents have a more significant influence on their child for two reasons: they can help their child overcome problems and perform better in school.<br><br> To begin with, parents enable their child to solve <mod target = problem>problems</mod> more wisely. This is attributed to the fact that having lived a long time, they have already experienced many things in life, such as rebellion, having to fit in, and getting good grades in school. Thus, they have <mod target = bigger>broader</mod> views on these matters and are able to provide a more satisfactory and objective solution. For example, when I was in fifth grade, I had a huge misunderstanding that led to a fight with my best friend. <del>Then,</del> <mod target = my>My</mod> friends were telling me not to speak to him until he apologized to me first. However, my mother suggested that I mend things <del>up</del> by taking the initiative to apologize first. Finally, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding on my part and had I not spoken to him first, we would never have cleared <ins>up </ins>the issue which could have cost <ins>us</ins> our friendship. This implies that parents' previous experience can be helpful for dealing with problems that are likely to occur in school.<br><br> In addition<del>&gt;</del>, by encouraging their child, parents can wield their influence on them and make them be successful in school. <del>Not to mention that this encouragement has more impact on them, being told by their parents, not classmates.</del> This is due to the fact that words of <mod target = encouragements>encouragement</mod> coming from parents can serve as key motivators for children to perform better and improve themselves.

These days, the pace of <mod target = science>scientific</mod> improvement is getting faster and faster, so it is very tough for older people to catch up with trends.

It is natural that older people do <mod target = great performances>well</mod> in their work because they have accumulated lots of <mod target = experiences>experience</mod> and <ins>have </ins>overcome substantial obstacles.

This is due to the fact that money that originated from depleting natural resources tends to represent their power in society by showing their ability to attain whatever they want<ins>,</ins> ranging from fancy cars to even trust in <ins>a </ins>relationship. To explain, in modern society, <ins>the </ins>economy <ins>is </ins>developed by consuming natural assets such as <mod target = woods>wood</mod> and coal.

558&Some people trust their first impressions about a person’s character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person’s character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Compare these two attitudes. Which attitude do you agree with? Support your choice with specific examples.":::"Many people tend to make judgments on one's character based on their first impression. This is a big mistake, though; evaluation on people's characters need to be done throughout time. This is because first impressions are based on how the people look on the outside only, and may not reveal their true personalities. <br><br>     First of all, making quick decisions on one's characteristics according to his or her <mod target = look>looks</mod> is highly likely to be erroneous. We have to take time and observe others to make <ins>up</ins> our mind on what kinds of people they are, as they may be different from what they seem to be. For example, I have a friend who looks pretty <mod target = gloom>gloomy</mod> on the outside. At first, I assumed  that she must be very quiet and calm. However, in the three years I have known her, talking and seeing her, I have found out that she is one talkative, and even rather hyper, girl. <br><br>     Secondly, first impressions mostly do not reveal one's real characteristics.

560&The second reading of a book is more interesting than the first reading.":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not the second reading of a book is more interesting than the first reading. The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that the first reading of a book <del>and reading various books</del> is more interesting and advantageous. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, it allows one to broaden view of life. Second, the second reading of a book is not good for one's health.<br><br> <br><br>           To begin with, the first reading of a book <del>and reading various books</del> enables one to widen <ins>a</ins> view of life. This is attributed to the fact that reading a lot of books <mod target = at>for</mod> <ins>the</ins> first time will expose one to different worlds of life styles, basic customs, and cultures from various contexts of books, and he or she can be familiarized with and embrace other cultures and people. Thus, one can make different friends with different backgrounds, which helps one to reduce prejudice and be open-minded toward strangers. For example, there <mod target = had been>was</mod> a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if reading books just <mod target = first time>once</mod> is good for readers. Of all, 78.1 percent of them stated that it is effective for them because they can read lots of books without the second reading and gain various experience indirectly, leading to broaden their perspectives. For this reason, the Seoul National University in Korea recommends their students to read books <ins>once</ins> <del>first time and various books</del>. Therefore, the first reading is more interesting than the second reading <del>of a book</del> as it helps readers to widen <mod target = view>views</mod> <mod target = of>in</mod> their <mod target = life>lives</mod>.<br><br> <br><br>           In addition, the second reading of a book is detrimental to one's health. This is due to the fact that readers become stressed out when trying to understand the contents of books, and stress is one of the main factors of diseases through weakening the immune system. Thus, readers are likely to be weaker when dealing with <del>the </del>challenges. According to an article, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor<ins>,</ins> claimed: “People do not need to read books at several times in order to understand the contents of books. This is because as they have to try to understand the whole meaning of <mod target = connection>connections</mod> of sentences, words, and paragraphs in books in order to understand entire contents of books, it is likely that readers <ins>will</ins> become stressed out. However, reading books is for being happy, obtaining information, and making one's mental health good. For this reason, people have to avoid reading books <del>at </del>several times.” Thus, the second reading of a book is not effective for people since they easily become stressed out when dealing with difficulties.<br><br> <br><br>           In <mod target = conclusion,I>conclusion, I</mod> strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. Once again, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoint of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim.":::

In my case, <ins>have</ins> I experienced <del>lives, both of them,</del> living in a small town and big city.

When I lived in Changwon, a small town<del>,</del> located in South Korea, I needed to find some educational institutes where I could learn English<del>,</del> for TOEFL.

""567&If people cannot say anything nice to someone, it is better not to say anything at all.""":::"In today's globalized society, it is widely believed that it is better to say nothing than to say bad things. Some people advocate that saying nothing could maintain the relationship easily. However, I disagree with this view. I firmly believe that saying nothing is worse than saying anything bad to someone. This is because first, giving someone bad things could be <del>an</del> <ins>good</ins> advice and second, saying nothing makes your social relationship worse.<br> <br>           To begin with, people usually learn from <ins>the</ins> <mod target = advices>advice</mod> of other people.

Over time, public criticism was excessive and <ins>the</ins> police became nervous. Fortunately, thanks to the informer's report<ins>,</ins> investigators finally arrested the criminal. The informer knew the face of the criminal through Facebook so he tipped off <ins>the</ins> police. However, in the old times, people were no help and could only watch.

Additionally, people achieve <del>some</del> knowledge more easily by watching television than by reading books. <br><br>First of all, people can remember what they see <mod target = in>on</mod> <del>the</del> television better.

While a lot of these aspects are crucial for a person's future, the money they earn should be the most important aspect they <mod target = take>put</mod> into account because it can <mod target = determine>decide</mod> our wealth and <mod target = health>heatlh</mod>. Therefore, I agree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that the most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns because of two reasons; stability and pursuing our dreams.<br><br>First, the money a person earns from their job<del>,</del> can be mentally healthy because it gives them stability in their lives. While some people state that doing what we want is the most aspect of a <del>person's </del>job, it is obvious that without money people cannot be stable. Some families might not be able to have meals every day because they do not have enough money and they would have to worry about what they would eat. For example, my cousin's father has been trying to achieve his dream of becoming an engineer. It has been <mod target = said>told</mod> that he abandoned all of his previous work because it was not what he wanted to do, and started working as an engineer. However, although the atmosphere of their household has improved, the family sometimes has to <mod target = borrow>loan</mod> money from our family to provide their family with a nice warm meal because the money he earns is not stable. Also, because of this, my cousin<ins>'</ins>s family <mod target = is>have to</mod> constantly worry<ins>ing</ins> about money and this has caused my cousin to get a mental illness. Therefore, although monetary values are not the only thing that should be considered, it is in fact the most important aspect of the job as so many can depend on it. <br><br>In addition to the idea that the money <mod target = people>a person</mod> earn<del>s</del> can give them stability, <mod target = it can also>the money a person earns can</mod> help <mod target = them>us</mod> to pursue <mod target = their>our</mod> dreams. When we have enough money we can spend our spare time watching movies or learning sports. This can be applied to workers who only go to work for money since they can earn a lot of money and use it during their spare time to do what they want<mod target = ,>;</mod> <ins>like</ins> having another job or attending a pottery class. According to a recent study by the Korean Statistics Bureau, the respondents who earned a lot of money<del>,</del> were asked whether they had achieved their dream job<ins>s</ins>. One third of the respondents responded that although they did not get to do the things that they always wanted to do, <del>and stated that </del>they were somehow doing it by spending their spare time doing what they pleased <del>to do </del>and did not have to stress about the fact that they did not get the job that they always aspired for. Therefore, even without having <del>to get </del>their dream job<ins>s</ins>, people can enjoy their lives just as much.<br><br>In conclusion, I agree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that the most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns because it allows them to be mentally healthy by giving them stability in life and allowing them to pursue their dreams even when they do not have an ideal job, by allowing them to pursue it in some other way without worrying <del>them </del>about money. In the future, when people apply for a job or go looking for one, people should not only consider aspects <mod target = such>just</mod> as the overall environment of the company<ins>,</ins> but should also consider whether they pay well enough since it gives <mod target = them>us</mod> so many advantages.":::

""609&attending a live performance (for example, a play concert, or sporting event) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television""":::"Attending any kind of live performance can have its benefits; people would be able to participate in the event and they could meet various people who are interested in the same field as they are. However, attending a live performance can also have various drawbacks; it could be unhealthy and it could somehow be a waste of money due to its size. Therefore, I disagree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that attending a live performance (for example, a play concert, or sporting event) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television because of two reasons; health and money.<br><br>To begin with, attending a live performance could be harmful to our health. Many live concerts tend to have speakers, which have their volume fully raised. Although this can enable everyone, even <del>to </del>the people in the very back, to hear their performances, it could be harmful <mod target = to>for</mod> people who are standing right next to the speakers. Also, in performances where a lot of excited fans are eager to get closer to the performers, the fans that are standing right at the front may be in danger of getting their internal organs damaged due to the pressure. Take myself as an example. Last year, I went to a Justin Bieber concert in Canada. As soon as I arrived at the concert hall, there were thousands of fans screaming and pushing to see Justin Bieber sing. Although the atmosphere was very encouraging, I couldn't concentrate on the concert because everyone kept pushing<ins>,</ins> and at one point my stomach started to ache. Also, my ears started to make weird noises due to the <mod target = constant>consistent</mod> screaming<del>,</del> and <del>the </del>blaring speakers. Thus, when the concert was over, I had to visit the doctor<del>s</del> to make sure I had not gotten an ear problem. Therefore, attending a live performance could harm our health. <br><br>In addition to the idea that attending a live performance could negatively affect our health, watching a live performance on television could save money and allow us to be more flexible with our time.  Generally in concert halls, the closer we are to the performers, the more expensive it is to watch.  Therefore, if people buy seats that are quite far away in order to save money, they cannot enjoy the show as much since it is hard<ins>er</ins> to watch the performers in detail.  However, by watching the show on television, we can see the performers in a more detailed way, since the cameras try to capture the performers in detail, and it does not have to cost us that much money. According to a research conducted by the Korean Statistics Bureau, two thirds of respondents who were asked whether watching live performances on the television was more beneficial<del> ,</del> responded that watching it on television was better. They also stated that watching the performances not only enabled them to see the performers perform in a more detailed way but also cost them less money because they paid less money on transportation. Also, they responded that they had been able to eat while watching the performances and stated that watching the performances on television allowed them more freedom.Therefore, considering the respondent<del>'</del>s<ins>'</ins> response<ins>s</ins>, attending a live performance will not only save money but also <ins>provide many other </ins>benefit<ins>s</ins><del> in a lot of ways</del>. <br><br>In conclusion, I disagree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that attending a live performance such as a play, concert, or sporting event is <del>a </del>more enjoyable than watching the same event on television because watching these performances on television can benefit our health by not exposing us <mod target = to>in</mod> harsh environments and could save <mod target = us>our</mod> money.

Likewise, given <ins>a </ins>choice, I would personally like to study English in school and my reasons are economical, educational, and social.<br><br> To start with, one of the great advantages that comes along with learning English is that a person  gets to have better <mod target = opportunities>opportunity</mod> to be successful in <del>the </del>society. This is because the demand for a person <mod target = to be>being</mod> able to speak <ins>English </ins>is increasing <mod target = more>higher</mod> than ever before. Due to globalization, companies are bound to be connected with companies overseas.

629&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers.

However, I agree with this statement that parents are the best teachers because parents spend more time with their children and parents are people who know their children the best.<br>            <br>First of all, since parents spend more time with their children, children are easily influenced by their parents' lifestyle<ins>s</ins>. In fact, children only spend six or seven hours a day at school and the rest of <ins>their </ins>time at home with their parents. In other words, children learn more from their parents' daily routine<ins>s</ins> such as how they talk each other, how they greet other people<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>how they eat etc. One day, I watched a TV program about students who are accepted into <ins>the </ins>Ivy League.

If you were all alone in such a location with so <mod target = many>much</mod> demand<ins>s</ins>, you will have less time and resources to enjoy what you have planned for<del>,</del> in the first place. However, if you're accompanied <mod target = by a>with</mod> few others, you'll have a much bigger chance to solve <del>out </del>these problems<del> easier</del>.

However, I strongly maintain that using cell phones should be allowed when using public <mod target = transprotation>transportation</mod>. The fundamental reason behind this is that using cell phones <mod target = in>on</mod> public transportation makes people time-efficient and available to always <mod target = connet>connect</mod> <ins>with</ins> <mod target = people>others</mod>.<br>    <br>First of all, using cell phones <mod target = in>on</mod> public <mod target = transfortation>transportation</mod> helps people not to waste their precious time.

According to my experience, I <mod target = go>went</mod> to <del>my</del> school by subway every morning.

""718&When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some prefer to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person. Which way do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.""":::"There are two ways of complaining about a defective product or poor service.

At a glance, though, the disadvantages such as the volatility of <mod target = a>one's</mod> proof and the aggravation of the situation by impulsive action are really discouraging. However, I believe that the advantages of the latter outweigh its disadvantages by far. In this essay, I will demonstrate some reasons why supporting the latter is reasonable and justifiable. <br><br>Firstly, you can get quicker service when you complain in person. A letter takes time to go through the mail and to be answered by someone. However, if you complain in person, you can go back to the store whenever you want and you usually get someone to help you as you wait. For this reason, this is a better use of your time. Let me offer an example<mod target = ,>.</mod> I had sent <ins>a company </ins>my pants and a letter written <ins>with </ins>some <mod target = complains>complaints</mod> when my pants <del>was</del> <mod target = shrink>shrank</mod> after washing. At that time I had to wait to change the pants <mod target = during>for</mod> one month. <br><br>Furthermore, if you complain in person, you can explain yourself more clearly. On the other hand, if you writer a letter, you cannot be as clear as you can in person. As the Korean proverb<mod target =  say>says</mod>, one<mod target =  facing>meeting</mod> is better than one hundred letters. This means that the best way to make <mod target = understand someone>someone understand</mod> is talking in person <del>except to writing</del>. We cannot read any emotion <mod target = and>or</mod> gesture of the other party through <mod target = the>a</mod> letter because it has no <mod target = eye and lip>eyes or lips</mod>.

That's why many schools are trying to <mod target = take>make</mod> visiting museums <del>as</del> <mod target = a>an</mod> essential part in <del>the course of</del> history class.

I think that stautory restrictions on smoking are good <del>rules</del> for <mod target = some>several</mod> reasons. <br><br>First, smoking is harmful both to the smoker and to bystanders who breathe the smoke which he or she emits.

Parents are human. Thus, they can be tempremental. They might sometimes have emotional <mod target = explosion>explosions</mod> if their children do not listen to <mod target = him>them</mod>. They may use abusive words to their children or even beat them. We've seen some parents who beat their own kids.

791&What are some of the qualities of a good parent? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer":::"There are a lot of qualities that a good parent should have. Among them, I think that a good parent should at least have these three <mod target = aspects>things</mod>: economical ability, patience and<mod target =  not having favoritism>objectivity</mod>. <br><br>First, a parent should have enough money to support the family. In general, a family needs a lot of money to spend: buying essential commodities, paying housing rent and so on. If the <mod target = parent>parents</mod> do not earn much money and their children have to work for money, their lives, especially the children' lives<ins>,</ins> will become miserable.

Therefore, until the children become independent of their <mod target = parent>parents</mod>, a parent must have considerable money. <br><br>Second, another quality that a good parent should have is patience. In general, the children are likely to make some mistakes or be resistant to <ins>a </ins>parent's normal order. However, if a son makes a mistake<mod target = ,> and</mod> the parent instantly <mod target = scold>scolds</mod> or even <mod target = hit>hits</mod> him severely then<ins> the</ins> situation <ins>will </ins>get worse and can never be recovered.

""818&People remember special gifts or presents that they have received. Why? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Compare the advantages of having friends who are different from you with the advantages of having friends who are similar to you. Which kind of friend do you prefer for yourself?

Some people may choose the same kinds of persons for their friends<del>,</del> because there is no conflict among them. I prefer, however, to make friends with persons who are <ins>not</ins> similar to me, because we can learn a lot, make up for some weak points and get some lessons. <br><br>First, we can learn a lot from different kinds of persons.  Some people may have their own unique knowledge, experiences and hobbies. If we are to make friends with them, we can get priceless information and develop new hobbies. I have two close friends in my high school. One was rather poor so that he had to get a job in a computer company instead of going to <del>the </del>university, but got used to the computer work; he taught me a lot about computer <mod target = graphic>graphics</mod> and photo <mod target = shops>shop</mod>. The other was so rich that he enjoyed many outdoor sports. I, who had been <ins>an</ins> indoor person, <mod target = get to know>learned</mod> how to water ski, <mod target = windsurfing>windsurf</mod> and golf. As those experiences illustrate, we can benefit from different kinds of persons. <br><br>Second, we can correct our drawbacks by making <mod target = friend>friends</mod> with different kinds of persons.  In general, when we are <mod target = in>with</mod> <del>the</del> similar kinds of persons, we can hardly see our weak points such as bad <mod target = manner>manners</mod> and strange habits. On the contrary, when we get in touch with different kinds of persons, they are likely to <mod target = indicate>point out</mod> our abnormal behaviors. I had a bad habit<del>:</del> <ins>of</ins> making loud <mod target = noise>noises</mod> during <del>the </del>meal time.

""834&Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Compare these two views. Which view do you agree with? Why?

Moreover, because schooling is cheaper than private education, attending school is worth <ins>the investment</ins>. However, in spite of all these benefits, for young children, emotional development is more important than increasing knowledge from books. Most character is built when people are young. Therefore, it is important what young children see, hear and experience. Unfortunately, in Korea, so many parents force their children to study from when they are so young. Parents believe that if their children learn something at a school, they will succeed when they grow up. Some children have no time to play with their friends. They have to go to public school, receive tutoring, piano <mod target = lessens>lessons</mod> and painting <mod target = lessens>lessons</mod>. They are so tired and get <mod target = stress>stressed</mod>. It is natural that they <mod target = undergo>have</mod> mental problems. It is sad that I hear <ins>about</ins> children's mental <mod target = problem>problems</mod> on television.

I think they can learn lots of things through playing. For example, because I grew up <mod target = at>in</mod> <mod target = a>the</mod> country, I always played outside with my friends. We went to fields in order to <mod target = grab>catch</mod> grasshoppers, frogs and dragonflies. Without reading <ins>a</ins> book or studying at <del>the</del> school, I learned what they eat, when they bear their babies and how they fly.

I believe that my nieces and nephews can enjoy their lives because they know what is worthy in their lives.<br><br>In summary, I strongly suggest that the older generation do not push young children to study from their <mod target = young>childhood</mod>.

In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? Use specific reasons and example to support your answer.""":::"As books have provided much knowledge and skill, it is no exaggeration that books play a pivotal role in developing human society. Of course, knowledge gained from books has many advantageous aspects. It is easy to be delivered from people to people, because it has already been modified for the purpose of transmission. We can agree that the primary reason of writing a book is to transfer its content to readers and make them understood. In addition, knowledge gained from books is <mod target = a>an</mod> efficient and effective <ins>way</ins> to learn many things within a short period of time. For instance, just <mod target = for>in</mod> a couple of days, people can learn many aspects about Japan even if they do not visit <del>it</del>. <br><br>However, I firmly believe that knowledge gained from experience is more important than <del>one </del>from books based on two reasons addressed below. First and foremost, knowledge gained from experience lasts for a longer time. In other words, those who possess experienced knowledge are more likely to memorize and use it longer and <ins>more</ins> frequently than those who <mod target = depends>depend</mod> on codified knowledge only. This is because people remember and use knowledge not only by using <ins>their </ins><mod target = brain>brains</mod>, but also <ins>by</ins> using all senses. It means that people usually use all five senses, such as <mod target = eye>sight</mod>, <mod target = nose>smell</mod>, or <mod target = ear>hearing</mod> to get knowledge derived from experience. The term 'implicit knowledge' clearly shows this point. It helps people embody their experienced knowledge to their memory and body, leading them to remember knowledge as long as possible. Many studies reveal that knowledge obtained from experience <mod target = endure>endures</mod> longer <del>time to people </del>due to the reasons addressed above. For instance, although people do not <mod target = get skills>learn</mod> how to drive a car by book, they can usually do well because of their knowledge gained by using all senses, from seeing to motion. <br><br>Second, a large number of requisite knowledge in <del>a</del> daily life is knowledge <ins>gained</ins> from experience, not from specialized books.  I agree that <mod target = mathematics>mathematic</mod> skills, <mod target = principle>principles</mod> of physics and any subject which is <mod target = complicating>complicated</mod> <mod target = are>is</mod> crucial for <ins>the</ins> improvement of human society.

For example, I really wanted to learn how to play tennis when I was fifteen. At that time, I read lots of tennis related magazines. However, to know from books is one thing and to play tennis is another. Only after practicing tennis with my friend could I enjoy playing tennis.

959&eating home-made food is better than eating out in restaurants or food stands":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is which <ins>it</ins> is better to eat home-made food or to eat out in restaurants. The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out<ins>,</ins> but<del>,</del> as far as I am concerned, I prefer to eat out. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <br><br>To begin with, it is beneficial to eat out since we are able to enjoy various kinds of world<del>'s</del> food in restaurants.  Nowadays, there are so many restaurants from all over the world such as Mexican, Spanish or Thai restaurants. Eating out has <ins>a</ins> strong advantage to experience those sorts of world<del>'s</del> food. For example, my family decided to <mod target = have dinner>eat</mod> out at least once a month and try a variety of <del>kinds of </del>world<del>'s</del> dishes. Each time, one of the family members chooses what to eat and other members ought to follow his decision <del>whether someone does not like his option or not</del>. This policy proved beneficial because all of the members found that there are a lot of delicious and healthy dishes from all over the world. My family still maintains this successful plan and I am really sure that <ins>the</ins> rest of my family <del>members </del>also anticipate the next surprising <mod target = eating out>dinner</mod>. In this regard, eating out provides a good opportunity to experience a diversity of foods from other countries. <br><br>On top of that, there is no need to burden ourselves to do dishes or make food<del>s</del>.  Most <del>of</del> mothers usually spend a large amount of time <del>on </del>preparing dishes for <ins>their</ins> <mod target = family>families</mod>. It could be irritating for mothers to <mod target = make>prepare</mod> <mod target = dishes>food</mod> <del>for</del> every day. Thus, eating out could be a solution for mothers since they do not need to worry about those burdensome <mod target = works>tasks</mod>. According to <del>a </del>recent research from Oxford University, the families who eat out regularly <mod target = shows>show</mod> a high level <del>of sense </del>of happiness while the families who rarely eat out <mod target = presents>present</mod> <ins>a</ins> relatively lower level <del>of that</del>. The researchers examined the reason for this and they found that the top rationale was that the family members feel doing dishes or preparing meals are quite boring and tedious. Therefore, the families prefer to eat out and it <mod target = help>helps</mod> <del>for </del>them to improve their sense of happiness. In this sense, eating out has a strong advantage to avoid boring things and it would be beneficial for <ins>a</ins> family's happiness. <br><br>In conclusion, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of <ins>the</ins> two reasons mentioned above. Once again, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim. <br><br>":::

My opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below. <br><br>First of all, it can be harmful for people who want to have a <mod target = secured>secure</mod> job if they <mod target = habe>have</mod> tried many different jobs beforehand.  In other words, people should search for a good job and stick to it<ins>;</ins> otherwise<ins>,</ins> they can give a bad signal to employers. In 2012, <ins>a</ins> Harvard <mod target = business>Business</mod> <mod target = school>School</mod> research team investigated Fortune 500 companies' human resource managers to find out what <mod target = characteristic>characteristics</mod> they really wanted <mod target = for>in</mod> their potential employees. To our surprise, language proficiency or good grades were not their top priority. They regarded 'loyalty' as the most important factor when hiring workers. To put it in another way, they hated those who tried too many different jobs before applying for their company. They thought these applicants were not loyal <del>to company</del>, easy to <mod target = go out>leave</mod> voluntarily if they were unsatisfied with their job, and not patient <del>to much stress</del> in the workplace. Rather, they highly liked to hire <ins>those</ins> who had no prior experience and possessed <ins>a</ins> fresh mind. To avoid the possibility <del>that</del> <ins>of being</ins> regarded as a mistrusted person, people should not try several chances before getting a long-term job. <br><br>Second, people can substitute taking several job risks with many internship programs.  These days, many colleges and corporations provide various internship programs for <mod target = to-be>prospective</mod> workers. By <mod target = experience>interning</mod> <ins>with</ins> several <del>internship </del>programs <del>several times</del>, people can find out what their real interest is and what kinds of factors they consider the most for a long-term work. After knowing these things, people can apply for the most suitable job to them and it can help them not to move among many jobs. In addition, applying for an internship is easier <del>to get a chance than </del>trying to find <del>out </del>a real job. With a small effort, time and cost, people can discover their true interest and priority. <br><br>All things considered, I highly support the idea that people should not try several jobs<del>, and had better stick to a first job</del>. One legendary CEO in South Korea <mod target = recollected>recalled</mod> <mod target = his>a</mod> memory, saying that 'Although it was hard to figure out whether my first job <mod target = was>would</mod> suit to me at that time, I finally can conclude that it was <mod target = my>the</mod> best choice I have ever made in my life. The title of CEO shows why <mod target = I>that</mod> <mod target = am>is</mod> true.' People should remember what he said. <br><br>":::

967&Children should spend their time studying or playing and should not be required to help their families.":::"It is important for children to study and play. However, in my opinion, <mod target = those>that</mod> <mod target = are>is</mod> not more significant than helping their families. This is largely due to the fact that helping families have <ins>a</ins> positive influence on shaping <mod target = the>their</mod> personalities in childhood. <br><br>On top of that, helping families encourages children to take responsibility.  If household chores are assigned to them, they will do that completely to <mod target = make>keep</mod> their words and to <ins>receive</ins> praise <ins>for</ins> what they did from their parents. From my experience, my parents let me do chores every day at an early age. Therefore, I could take responsibility for my tasks, so I could <ins>study</ins> well <del>in studying</del>. <br><br>Second, helping their families gives them an opportunity to communicate with their family members.

977&Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.":::"It is often said that technology has hindered children from being <ins>more</ins> creative than before. However, in my opinion, I disagree with <mod target = the>that</mod> claim and believe that technology gives young ages useful ways of thinking creatively. This is because advanced technologies allow children to <mod target = give>use</mod> various educational tools and also lead parents to share information related to education easily.<br><br>First of all, educational methods and tools raising creativity become various and popular as science and technology have been developed.  To be specific, thanks to the advanced technological development, many innovative materials and electronics are created and become common and inexpensive. At the same time, a variety of tools for education <mod target = are>have</mod> emerged using those materials and electronics. For example, a portable gadget<ins>,</ins> especially for children<ins>,</ins> is in <mod target = trend>style</mod> in Korea. With this machine, children can draw or write anything they want. Then the machine automatically transmits the drawing to teachers who specialize in <del>the </del>child education. After analyzing the drawing, the teachers give the children and their parent comments for improving creativity. This demonstrates <mod target = a>the</mod> positive role <del>of</del> technology <ins>has </ins>on improving children's creativity. <br><br>On top of the claim above, parents can easily access information related to education thanks to the Internet, which lets them know useful methods for raising their children's creativity.  Specifically, there are many practical websites and forums <mod target = that>where</mod> parents share their nurturing know-hows and useful educational methods. From these communities, parents can get information about the way <ins>to make</ins> their children<del> are </del>more creative. For instance, last year, one of the parenting websites won one of the most honorable awards related to education in Korea. The website awarded it because it lowered the significant cost <mod target = for>of</mod> education by giving parents inexpensive and practical methods of raising knowledge and creativity. After learning methods from the website, many parents apply them to their own children. They say that the methods are effective. <br><br>In sum, I think that technology gives children more opportunities to become more creative than they were in the past. This is largely because children can develop creativity by using interesting gadgets and parents learn educational know-hows from the Internet. <br><br>":::

979&The best way to improve the quality of education is to increase teacher's salaries.":::"Some people think that changes in salary have minimal effect on the quality of education. However, in my opinion, I believe that increased salary is the best approach to enhance <del>the </del>education. This is because <ins>a</ins> higher salary can motivate teachers<del>,</del> and because teachers can use <ins>the</ins> added salary to provide their students more materials and information. <br><br>To begin with, teachers can <ins>be</ins> stimulated by <ins>an</ins> increased salary.  To be specific, if there is <ins>a</ins> rise in salary, teachers would teach their students more ardently and are willing to teach more. According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2008, there were two groups of teachers observed with the different salaries <del>to teach students</del>: Group A received <ins>a</ins> higher income, and Group B received <ins>a</ins> lower income. Later<ins>,</ins> both groups were interviewed and the result showed that Group A was more enthusiastic in teaching students, whereas Group B showed just <del>a</del> plain behavior and were not really passionate. This implies that higher salaries of teachers do have a large impact on the quality of education. <br><br>On top of that, <ins>a</ins> higher salary can help teachers offer students more materials and better information.  This is because teachers can buy some educational tools and can educate themselves by spending <ins>their</ins> increased salaries. For example, my uncle was an English grammar teacher in <mod target = the>a</mod> middle school. However, my uncle never practiced English speaking. Therefore, he could not speak English very well. As the world became more and more globalized, the school that my uncle work at increased his salary to train his English speaking ability. As a result, his speaking improved a lot. Therefore, he could teach his students not only grammar but also speaking. This resulted in providing more materials and information. Without <ins>the</ins> increased salary, he could <mod target = have not>not have</mod> taught his students with high quality. <br><br>To sum up, increased salary is an effective motivation tool and can <mod target = make>enable</mod> teachers to provide students with more helpful and practical information. For these reasons, I strongly believe that increasing teacher's salaries is the most efficacious way to improve the quality of education. <br><br>":::

Children should not make important decisions alone""":::"Along with vast societal advancements, some issues are gaining popularity among the populace, one of which is whether <ins>or not</ins> children should be left to make important decisions alone. In view of today's communal conditions, it would be inappropriate to let children make important decisions all by themselves; however<ins>,</ins> it would be more suitable to guide them and oversee them <del>to</del> make <ins>the</ins> right choices. Amidst the insurmountable bases which <mod target = formulated>formulate</mod> my stand, seemingly<ins>,</ins> there are two eye-catching facets. <br><br>The initial motive for my stand that is exceptionally evident is that the problems that children face these days are too complicated.  It is simply too hard for children to <mod target = estimate>extrapolate</mod> <mod target = what>how</mod> their choice would eventually turn out. For example, when children choose which subject to take at school<ins>,</ins> they tend to choose a subject with <ins>a</ins> <mod target = less>lower</mod> burden or simply follow their friends. However, there are some essential prerequisite subjects that they need to take in order to understand more difficult subjects to come. One of my <mod target = friend>friends</mod><del>,</del> who wanted to become a software developer<del>,</del> stopped taking math classes after 7th grade because he found it very boring. He thought there was no connection between <mod target = computer>computers</mod> and math. Apparently<ins>,</ins> he failed to get an admission <mod target = for>to</mod> the computer science department and regrets his foolish decision greatly. <br><br>A further cause <ins>of</ins> why I am for the same opinion with <ins>the</ins> <mod target = aforesaid>aformentioned</mod> explanation is that children do not have ability to be responsible for their decisions.  Sometimes a wrong decision might cost thousands of dollars to others and the person who made such <ins>a </ins>decision. However, children do not posses such <mod target = amount>amounts</mod> of money or legal responsibility for the damage they have done. All <ins>the</ins> aftermath will be left for their parents or guardians. It is very obvious that a decision should be left for the person who will be responsible for the consequences. <br><br>To sum up, it is not appropriate to let children make important decisions alone because problems they face are too complicated and they are usually not responsible for what they have done. Anchored on <mod target = aforesaid>aforementioned</mod> evaluations and arguments<ins>,</ins> we can conclusively say that children should not make important decisions alone. However, everything has two sides, it would not be wise to oppress children and tie their hands because they need to develop <ins>a</ins> sense of self-esteem. We should practice caution and moderation. <br><br>":::
