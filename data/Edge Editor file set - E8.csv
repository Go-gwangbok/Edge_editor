What is the most important animal in your country? Why is the animal important? ,//,"Many animals like tiger, cow, dog, and cat have an importance in the various aspects like as keeping guard over night and cultivating the soil, not to mention keeping the ecosystem.  Despite that, if I should choose one animal among them, dogs are the most significant in my country, Korea in terms of emotional development of children and dogs’ faithfulness. 

First of all, dogs are really helpful for the emotional development of children. That is, in the recent Korean society, parents are too busy for their work to take care for children and finally likely to make children selfish and rarely realizing the importance of sincere attention toward others.  In the case that children spend time with dogs while parents are not with them, however, they learn the spirit to consider others from dogs with giving a love to them like feeding, washing, wearing them.  Actually, one survey reported that Korean children grow up to the generous and mild character after living with dogs.

Moreover, dogs are faithful and give a lesson to many Korean people.  There is the famous saying in Korea like “The faithfulness of dogs is better than people.”  As this saying means, they are extremely subordinate to their master and even if they are thrown a few miles away, they desperately come back to their master even without eating anything.  Actually, one dog called as “Jin-do” is the representative dog of Korea, a symbol of faithfulness.  Therefore, dogs’ unchangeable love and trust to their master give many Koreans to a meaningful lesson like as the trust among people. 

Accordingly, dogs are considered as the most important animal in Korea.  Than any other animal, they more contribute to the formation of the good character like considering others and the demonstrator for the faithfulness among people.",//,essay,::
"It has been said. ""Not everything that is learned is contained in books."" Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? ",//,"There is a saying ""Nothing outlives book."" Since the creation of letters, people have started to record mysterious happenings, marvelous things, religious beliefs, historical events etc., in books. In this vantage point, books are not but  sums of human knowledge gained and experienced by people from ancient times to these days. However, knowledge and experiences in books have been ceaselessly refined and finally lost its crudity. As a result, knowledge gained from books are likely to be more abstract and indirect than knowledge gained from experience. 

       When we learn something by experience, it means that we happen to get a lesson about it by using our own body and soul. In contrast, when we learn something in books, it means we happen to know that by using only our brain. This is a great difference. For example, we can easily find books which say touching a burning pot could hurt you. However this kind of warning doesn't make good effects because it is very abstract. On the contrary, if a person who happen to touch a burning pot by mistake, easily learns it is very dangerous to get closer to hot objects. Moreover he will memorize it for a long time. Therefore knowledge learned by experience is more realistic. 

       In addition, knowledge in books is apt to be biased. Knowledge and information in books are tend to reflect their writer's point of view. It is not surprising to find various history books which witness the same historical event but show great different perspectives. Writers can deftly manipulate knowledge by hiding some or over-emphasizing a fact or another. This kind of cheating is easily overlooked by readers who are prone to believe that writers tell the truth. On the other hand, knowledge learned by experience is more direct. so there is no loophole for manipulation. For example, reports by press on damage or death toll for wars or disasters are often less precise than those by witness who experience the events in the place. 

       In my opinion, knowledge gained from books provide us basic and broad back ground information, But knowledge gained from experience give us more realistic and direct ideas for affairs. Therefore, I think knowledge learned by experience is more important and precious. Even though, knowledge in books seems to be better arranged and selected, we also have to listen carefully to vivid and living lessons of experience. ",//,essay,::
"Some students prefer to study alone, while others prefer to study with a group of poeple. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ",//,"When the issue on the study method is discussed, almost all people, especially student, have their respective answer. This means that it takes greater important to them than any other. I also have a special way of study, which is rightly by study group. Although there are a lot of benefits in studying by oneself, I prefer to study group for following reasons. 

Before we consider the way to study, it is very reasonable to know what purpose of study is. I means by the purpose of study that it indicate not only preparing the exam, but also recognizing the facts, such as historical events, mathmatics, economic and so on. To recognize the facts is impossible by oneself because there are many view-points among people. The most fundamental aim of the study is to understand other's respective opinions. Therefore, we can obtain the truth by accepting or considering opinion of another person. 

Next, I cannot help raising following question ; how can we do when we have a question or problem? There are several answers about above question, such as using Internet, reference book and so forth. But, I think that the best answer is asking other persons about problems. As you know, when other persons like friends directly help one with problem, it is most effective way in solving that. 

In sum, different people have different answer due to their respective point of view. From what has been discussed above, I can draw the conclusion that studying with group is more beneficial than with alone. ",//,essay,::
A company has announced that it weshed to build a large factory near you communiry. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community. Do you support or oppowe the factory? Explain your position.,//,"     If a company were to announce that it wished to establish a big factory in my commmunity, I think I would have mixed emotions because there are advantage and disadvantage to building a factory, especially in a medium-sized town like mine. However, I think disadvantage affects to my town much more than advantage does in repect of pollution. 
     
     
     The main benefit of a new factory is obvious: increased jobs. During IMF, some TV program I was used to enjoying introduced one city experiencing some changes after a factory established in it. Before a factory entered, many of the heads of the families in the city were not able to get jobs because of 'System-Control' of the government. So many families underwent financial straits, and mood at home was heavy. Some of patriarches tried to deal with their mind as drinking, and fights were often occur on the street or at home. However, after building a factory, many jobless persons could get jobs and work on it. Families were released from financial pressure more and more and the atmosphere at home became warm. Also patriarches were not drinkers at all. All of the good changes originated from a new factory. 
     
    However, there is another concern about building a new company : pollution.   My city has many lakes and streams. I would want to know if they would be affected. Could you remember the happening 'itai-itai disease' in Japan from 1955 to 1957? The people in Doyama in Japan, especially old women, realized that their legs more and more bent into the inside. With getting worse the symptoms, they walked with faltering steps like a duck, ultimately, they went died on a bed with crying 'itai,itai'(It means I'm very sick)  Do you know the reason of that?? It was 'cadmium' drained by the factory nearby the river in town. Cadmium overflowed by the plant streamed and entered the river in town and the persons were affected while they didn't perceive. Finally, the factory destroyed the town. I don't never want to happen something like this in my community. 
     

      In conclusion, a big factory could give my community both advantage and disadvantage ; job and pollution. However, now most of the people in my community have jobs, so important thing is preserving natural environment in my community. Therefore, I opposes that a big factory should be established in my community.

Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which view point do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice. ,//,"  In modern society, we are running for some purpose such as good score, university in school, Regardless of the period of the vacation, the vacation enables students wearing out due to hard work to take a rest and  could be vitamin to recharge our battery. When we find life a bore, I will have a long vacation in that it give students the chance which they can have the board outlook on life by a long trip and the time to prepare for the tests of special purposes. 


      On the one hand, a long vacation give us the chance which we can have the board outlook on life by a long trip. Long vacation enables students to travel to a region far away from their towns. During an adolescent period, taking a long trip is very useful. Through that, they can learn the wisdom of life as well as the wide knowledge that they could not learn in classes. For example, I traveled to Austrailia and worked as volunteer in  ATCV(Austrailia Trust Conservation Volunteer) for two months by using my first university summer vacation. Through the trip, I learned not only the world view  but also the importance of the nature by experiencing ATCV in Austrailia. Therefore by providing the chance to have a long trip, they can widen their outlook on life. 

     On the other hand, a long vacation could be used as the time to prepare for the tests of special purposes. As you see, there are some tests needing long preparation times for special purposes such as foreign language ability and professional technique. However, if the time to be given were so short for preparing the test,  they cannot concentrate on the test and the possibility which they can pass the test could be smaller. For instance, there is my brother who studied computer software for a technical license for two months by using winter vacation, finally he could get the license, he was employed at one of the most famous computer companies. Consequently, through a long vacation, students can prepare for the test of special purposes and develop their special abilities . 

In conclusion , I  have an opinion that if students use their long vacations effectively, they can broaden their experiences through traveling and enhance their special abilities by getting la long vacation  make students’ outlook more wide and give them the opportunity to prepare  for the  tests of special purposes. ful  for if students use their long vacations effectively, they can broaden their experiences through traveling and enhance their special abilities by getting licenses of the tests.

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People behave differently when they wear different clothes. Do you agree that different clothes influence the way people behave? Use specific examples to support your answer. 

",//,"There are many kinds of cloth for many specific situations. when I play sports, I wear some comfortable clothes that don't annoy movement. As you know, ceaseless movement is needed to play almost sports. For even some stationary sports, it is very important to feel comfortable for a good result. Then, why don't we always wear some comfortable clothes? It is because there is social restriction about clothes. then, why do this exist? what I want to say here starts from this question. 

        Clothes can affect our behaviors. As I mentioned above, when we play sports, we wear comfortable clothes to be free from disturbing our movement. And, we can move more actively. It will make a good result at the game. Is it impossible to wear a suit and a hat instead of a baseball uniform and a cap? Of coursem, not. But, they can not do well because of the uncomfortable clothes. So, I can say that cloth can affect our behaviors. 

        Moreover, I can find out one more fact that is about the relationship between cloth and behavior, from the example that I mentioned above, sports game. You know that sports players wear uniforms when they play a game. They wear uniforms which are same color, same design. Each element of the team would realize that they belong to same team. This feeling about belonging can help to make better cooperation for the players. Not only sports players, whoever belong to same organization feel this from uniform. And it can affect their behaviors to make a good result. 

        In conclusion, I mentioned some examples that show relation between clothes and behavior. It is obvious that different clothes influence the way people behave. So, good selection of clothes for proper situation would be very important. ",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts.",//,"There are two worlds: the world which is, and the world which might be. Nonfiction deals with the former, which is happening and happened, and fiction deals with the later, which the writer create. some people think they should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. But from once upon a time, we have read fiction such as detective novel, science novel . There is no reason to restrict our reading to nonfiction such as real events, real people, and established facts. In my case I voice a counterargument that people should read fiction too because reading a fiction make us to be imaginative and is one way of a rest in order to get out of  stresses.   

First of all,  reading a fiction  make us to be imaginative in our life. When we were children, we enjoyed reading novels such as fantasy novel, detective novel and watching an exciting cartoon on TV. Because some sort of fiction make an effect on our dream, we dream of pilot,  president, a detective , scientist and so on.  As you see, the imagination play an important role as motive power which our dream come true. For example, after I read Gullivers’ travel written by Jonathan swift, for long time a deep impression and excitation didn’t disappear. Whenever possible I dream of the adventure and oversea travel, So far I traveled several countries such as Austrailia, America, India, Nepal, Thailand, Japan  and got precious ones through travel. Above I mentioned, reading a fiction make an good effect on the power of imagination  in our life. 

Next, reading a fiction is a good way to take a rest and get out of stresses. With a developing industry and tight schedule of our modern life, we are having a trouble with stresses which make us so tired physically and mentally , even which induce the disease  like  cancer. By using spare time, when we read fiction, we can relax us without a pill of tranquilizer and get out of stresses effectively. To illustrate, while I worked hard in graduate school due to a heavy burden of a national research project, I am in bad condition both mentally and physically, even while a mere trifle irritate me. I start to read novel “The Lord Of The rings” for a solution to get rid of my problem. It results in a good success. Even though tough research project and tight schedule, I can have a tranquil heart without stresses. Under mental stresses, sitting on the bench, let’s read an exciting novel, and then you feel free, comfortable. 

In sum up, for the above-mentioned reasons, I support the idea that reading a fiction is beneficial for enhancing the power of the imagination and a good rest and the removal of our stresses. On top of that, we can say that these benefits from reading a fiction are priceless. ",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. 

",//,"Why is it so important to acquire knowledge that is true and real? Imaginative and creative people do not prefer to live in mediocre life. To be successful in these days, people must think unique and rare ideas. Therefore, I do not agree that people should read books which are published by real events, people, and facts. 

        Knowing only how to think common thought, people do not know methods of surviving in a real life. Let’s think that one has never imagined anything and has learned about only real facts.  He will be a very weird person in society; for example, he will believe nothing before he sees it if people tell stories which they experienced. Consequently, he will be not only isolated from others but also a doubtful and cold person. 

        For children, ability of imagination and creativity is a significant trait. Most mothers try to listen to music and read books before babies are born. This occurrence is all for developing baby’s ability to think imaginative ideas. However, if children read only non-fictional books, they will become ordinary and standard people in the future. In addition, creative people remain to be remarkably successful by inventing unique items or extraordinary business plans. Hence, being creative and imaginative is important nowadays. 

        In conclusion, people do not need to read only books about real events, people, and facts because it can reduce an ability to imagine ideas and make people unemotional. If you want to success in your life, read fictional books instead of non-fictional one and become creative and imaginative! ",//,essay,::
"Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 

",//,"  In Korea society, most social system was under the influence of the Confucianism, so the authority of the teachers was so strong that we could not help obeying the order and the teachings of them, moreover evaluating them is not allowed. But as the time goes on and on, Viewpoint of the education is changing. Now, we can say and I agree with the above statement , ”Schools should ask students evaluate their teachers.” In that evaluating their teachers improve their skills and the quality of the education through the competition and is a good way for school administrators to evaluate teachers efficiently. 


     In the first place , evaluating teachers improve their skills and the ability of the education through the competition. As you see, the profession like teacher is stable and there is few possibility to be dismissed , on the other hand they are apt to fall in the period of a lassitude. Because teachers also are human being, they could get lazy and difficult to control their first minds, back to basics.  To get rid of this kind of a lassitude, evalutation about teachers give them some sort of incentives which refill with a passion. To demonstrate,  in our uviversity, the system of evaluating professors was introduced two years ago. Before it  was introduced, the atmosphere of the lecture room was changed into a big enthusiasm, so we can learn a lot. Finally, without being restricted from leftovers of  Confucianism and thinking twice, the introduction of  the system of evaluating teachers is beneficial to rational education to enhance their skills and quality of the education through the competition. 

     In the second place, it is a good way for school administrators to evaluate teachers efficiently. When the school administrators evaluate the achievement of teachers, so many factors are included to it. In my thinking, one of the most important factors is whether students are satisfied with the lecture of the teachers, which show us the ability and the quality of the teachers. For example , Korea Information and Communication University used this system four years ago. The teacher who  get the worst score of evaluation receive some penalty, In viewpoint of efficiency of the organization, they succeed in it. If glancing, evaluating other people might be seen to bad thing, but it could contain more positive effects. Therefore we call evaluating teachers as a good method for managing the school organization. I think there should be no exception in every organization . 


     To sum up , I take the review that evaluating teachers is necessary for improve their skills and the quality of the education through the competition and is the efficient method for school administrators to evaluate teachers. Furthermore the good quality  of  the  education system which we will get by evaluating teachers absoulutely contributes to the developments of korea ",//,essay,::
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.   ,//,"What do you think of learning? There could be plenty of answers to this question. Some can say learning means aquiring some kind of knowledge, while others regard learning as being harmonious with friends, family and neighbers. In my view, learning is the process of establishing relation with ohters. In this sense, I think we can learn more by parents because parents know us better than any other teachers in the world. What's more, parents give us love and affection that is indispensible for us to make good relation with others. 

First, as is mentioned above, there is no teacher who knows children better than parents. This is because parents have spent most of their time with their children. Although it is difficult for parents to give their children specific knowledge, information or skill, the very fact that parents know their children very well make them the best teachers. For example, teachers have no way to find out what their students need before students ask teachers what they want or need, because there are many students and few teachers. In addition, teachers can not spend most of their time in taking care of just one student. On the contrary, parents can spend relatively much time to their children. Thus, by spending a lot of time with their children, they can easily find out what children want to do, what they feel, and which they like more. 

Secondly, there is powerful device that make parents the best teacher such as love. Although there are many good teachers in this world, who can love their students more that their own children? Plus, in most case, the relationship between teachers and students are over when students graduate from school. Without personal affection to certain students, keeping touch with them is not as easy as we think. On the contrary, parents, the best teacher who love their students keep in touching with children with great concern before they die. 

In sum, it is not easy for us to conclude that parents are the best teacher because they can not teach us proffesional knowledge. However, the fact that parents understand thier children better that teachers and they love their children make parents the best teachers in this world. In this sense, I strongly agree with that statement.",//,essay,::
"Some people prefer to live in a small town, Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. 

",//,"   I had lived in a small town until in high school, after that, I has lived in a big city. So I could experience all advantages and disadvantage of a small town and a big city. When I was in a small town, I thouht a small town was better that a big ciry, but after I moved to a large city, I never imagine that I return a tiny community. 
   
     Initially, in a large city, people could have many cultural opportunities more easily. For example, a few weeks ago, I and my friend living in a small town far from a large city went to the theater to watch very famous musical, 'Cats'. In my case, it took me about half of an hour to go to the theater by subway, but my friend spent almost 3 hours arriving in the theater by car because she lived in a tiny community. She exhausted valuable time in which she did something different and more money so that she drove a car operated with oil. In her small town, there were no theater for musical or play and many of the town were not interested them. So all she could do was that she went to a large city for seeing musical or play. If she had have born in a big community, she could have enjoyed musical and play as much as she wanted. 

     Next, much more medicine service is given to people living in a large city. Now I can imagine one documentary televised on TV last year. On documentary a story of one men preparing 'Disabled Olympic' was introduced. The men had blindness of one eye. According to his words, it originated from a unexpected accident. When he was a child, he and his friend played the game using a toy sword. The game was very exciting and they more and more fell into it. While they enjoying the game, the accident succenly occured. The sword of his friend stung his right eye deeply. He felt a extreme pain on his eye, and cried loudly. No sooner took him to the hospital in town than his mother saw his hurtten eye but doctor said that he should go to the bigger hospital in a big city. So He and his mother went to the hospital in a big city as soon as possible, but he lost his eyesight during going to there. Through this case, we can know why people prefer to live in a big city. 

     In conclusion, I prefer to live in a big city that living in a small town. Of course, living in a small town has the advantages ; clean air, pure water and stablility  earned from living with nature. However, when considering that I am young and health also now I need the advantages of cultural chances and medicine servise, it is obviousely much better for me that I live in a large city.

People attend college or university for many different reasons. Why do you think people attend college or university?,//,"   These days, more and more people have been attending University or college. Some are attending University without certain purpose and just follow people around them, while others enter college to prepare their jobs or to study deeply. I think people attending University because they want to have more profound knowledges about their careers and enhance the levels of their cultures. 
         
               First of all, University helps students to be competent worker by studying their major. There are lots of faculty who have been studying specially and rendering remarkable achievement to their fields. By taking their classes, students learn professors' accumulated knowledges and wisdom. Also, friends in same major can share informations about goals that they want to achieve in the future. In short, students can develope themselves as a good worker through studying in advanced classes of their major with students who have common interests and goals. 
        In addition, University helps students get common senses and develope sociabilities which are essential to become cultured men. There are many club activities which are helpful to develope ourselves. In my case, I attained intellectual cultures by doing newspaper club activity and became sociable by getting along with various kind of people in the club. Plus, central library in University has many books about liberal arts  available for students who have difficulties in buying expensive books. Shortly, people can cultivate themselves better by attending University.           
               
             To sum up, in my opinion, people want to enter University for career preparation and being well-grounded men in various fields. As the society become more complex, university will perform important role of making professional worker and cultivate people. ",//,essay,::
"It has been said, ""Not everything that is learned is contained in books."" Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? ",//,"          People learn constantly from their birth to death. Not only school education or books but also things we see, hear, touch are good materials to get knowledge. Among them, I think knowledge of experience is more important than knowledge of books because of its durability, and it teaches us precious values like cooperation and flexibility. 
         
               First, we hardly forget what we learn from our own experience. For example, we learn importance of money and difficulty of earning money in capitalistic society by studying economics through books. Also, we memorize how money circulates between producer and consumer written in textbooks. However, we usually forget about it as time passes. On the other hand, we can learn hardship of gaining money or way of profiting in person through part-time job. The reason is that they are more practical, and as we learn it using five senses. In short, knowledge of experience are more important because it's unforgettable.   
        Secondly, knowledge of experience offers a sense of cooperation and flexibility which are important to build up one's character. Even if we can gain boundless knowledges studying books about astronomy, mathematics, and so on, it's no use if we bury ourselves in pedantic or impractical theory neglecting the value of cooperative spirit and flexibility, which can be gained by social experience like contacting directly with other people and various circumstances. To sum up, getting knowledge from experience is good to develop cooperative and flexible attitude.     
         
                In conclusion, if I have to choose between knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books, I would choose the former. The reason is that it's lasts longer, and gives us cooperative and flexible mind. However, what we don't have to forget is that both knowledges of experience and books must be in balance.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,//,"People have invented new machines and materials to make our life more convenient and joyful. Among them, television is one of the most effective inventions. In my opinion, I don't agree with the statement television has destroyed communication among friends and family because it gives people common subjects to talk about and time to get together.
         
              First of all, a family can have time to be with by watching television. These days, each individual is busy doing his/her own work and has different interest. However, after dinner, most family gather in the living room to watch TV. In my case, my family has talked about each others' daily life while watching television together. On the contrary, when my father puts the television away to prevent my eyesight from weakening, my family members did their own business in their own room. Shortly, television provides time to communicate with family.     

        Moreover, we can get some topics of conversation from television. There are lots of interesting and up-to-date informations that most people can share and enjoy. For example, a popular soup opera 'A lover of Paris' of SBS provided intimate and funny subjects to talk with friends. Also, television shows us about current issues so that we can discuss about it. In summary, whether that kind of topics are vulgar or not, it's certain that television helps people communicate with others by giving common interests and topics.     
         
                 In conclusion, I think television is serviceable stuff in the aspect of helping people communicate with their family and friends by giving chances and subjects to talk. Lastly, what I want to suggest is that people should control themselves to do not addict to watching television, and use it wisely to have better communication with others. ",//,essay,::

Some of them like to watch movies at home sitting on the sofa and some others want to watch them at a theater. As a mania for movies, I prefer the latter, which is the more attractive way to enjoy movies. 

Firstly, theater has a good environment to concentrate on movie. We can enjoy powerful sound and a big screen. Also the inside is dark enough. These are necessary if you want to enjoy the movie thoroughly. Although there are some equipment like home theater to provide similar environment to houses, because of the magnitude of the room the quality is much lower than the theater can offers. 

Secondly, you can have your own time in a theater. No one disturbs you by asking you ""What happened just before?"" or ""I don't like that actor.” You can just enjoy the movie alone and can talk about it after the screening is over. Those conditions cannot be accomplished if you are watching it with your family or friends at home. 

So if somebody wants to enjoy a movie, I would recommend him to go to a Movie Theater even though he has to pay for it. Because it is worth paying to guarantee pleasant facilities and one's own time. ",//,essay,::

First, as I mentioned it is much more convenient to eat out side. We don't need to prepare dishes for a long time and is cleaning needed neither after finishing the meal. And various choices are possible if we go to the place like food court. It is for sure that eating out is better when we don't have enough time to eat and prepare good quality of food. Eating at home can be very time consuming work to people who are busy at most times. 

Second, another merit if we eat at restaurants is the mood and environment we can enjoy there. Home can be a comfortable place to eat, but a restaurant which has a waterfall and some paintings at walls for example, gives us kinds of pleasure that we are enjoying food around a good landscape. 

In summary, eating out is a convenient and pleasant way to enjoy food. Of course we cannot have food out every day but if conditions are appropriate, wouldn't it be happy to enjoy new food and new environment? ",//,essay,::

Books have usually had writer's insight. From my perspective, I think that we can read the books that are about a fairy tale or science fiction to develop with a good dream and a desire. Moreover, however historians have written a history, Historians' opinions have always affected the history. 
   

First of all, fairy tales and science fictions have impressed the children. If children read fairy tales, they can easily realize good and evil. Besides, we read open science fictions to develop our hope. When I went to the elementary school, I open red science fiction. I could learn a lot of science common senses because science fictions had generally common senses and have the dream that I want to become a doctor. Fairy tales also teach children good and evil and children know what bad is or what good is.  Fairy tales and science fictions was written by fictions but those help us to have hope. 
   

Moreover, history has  written by historians. History have the fact. However, history have open historian's subjective view. Each persons can concludes the same historical fact to different opinions. For example, The Korea war have two different opinions. One is that the Korea War helped the country to develop economy because it could start  foreign trade. Another is that the Korea War destroyed Korean economy because most of factories was extremely ruined. Many historians have obviously different thoughts. Thus, however History was written about the fact, The fact isn't all of contents. 
   

In conclusion, I don't agreed to read the books that are about the facts. Fairy tales and science fictions give children dreams and desires. Moreover, histories aren't composed of all of the facts and we can't read books that are about the facts. ",//,essay,::
Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? ,//," The vacation is the opportunity for students to do something special they cannot experience in school. It is important to determine how long the vacation is more efficient for student to relax enough and prepare the next term and to learn the real life from parents and the real society behind school. I believe that long vacation each year can be more helpful for the student than several short vacations throughout the year. 

     First, they can do something sufficiently they cannot do during the school time when they have long vacation like learning sports or traveling. When I was freshman in university, I desired to travel European country with back and went around the country with great satisfaction during 2 months summer vacation. If there were only 1 month vacation, I may have not traveled fully and have regretted the lack of time. 

    Second, they can be taught from their parents during vacation, and the home education is as important as the school education. When the students have enough long vacation, they can spend more time with their parents besides their other activity. When I was high school student, I helped my mother’s house choirs and my father’s work during winter vacation for 3 months. Before that time, I thought that I was deserved to be taken care of by my parents. But, though the experience, I felt really how difficult was my parents working, and I realized truly I had to respect my parents. It was through my real experience in home that I recognized sincerely respecting my parents. Eventhough I always learned from the teacher that I had to have regard in high my parents. 

    In addition, it is necessary for the students to prepare the next term. If they have only short vacation, they cannot have enough time to learn the real experience which cannot be taught from the school and relax at the same time. During vacation, they have to have the time not only doing something they would like to do but relaxing to prepare the next term. If there is only short vacation, they will be too busy to finish the vacation good and get ready the new school semester. 

     In conclusion, I am firmly convinced that the long term vacation is essential each year for the students to try what they would like to do which they cannot do during the term and have the opportunity to be trained at home. In addition, through the long vacation, they can complete the vacation well and plan the next term.       ",//,essay,::

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ,//,"   Almost people don't remember their childhood years; what they did, what they thought, and what happened. They were too young to remember everything. When we forgot the old memories, the only way to find out what happened before is to ask to our parents and our acquaintances who have known us since we were so young. our old memories are fading away even right now. Then, do the childhood years mean nothing? Absolutley not. 

        Firstly, the period that we got socialized is our childhood year. It means important. We learn the customs of the community which we belong to. That is, we learn who we are, what we have to, and what our society is. From learning things like this, we get a position of our society. And then, we can play our roles in the society. Through interaction with other people in the society, each of  us makes personality. It a part of the concept of socializaion. All these things happen in our childhood years.

 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,//," There are a wide range of controversies about this statement that parents are the best teacher. Some people think that parents are the best teacher because they give their children many wisdoms of living which they experienced, and they well know their children any other in the world. Others say that parents do not become the best teacher for their children because they really love their children so they can not realize their mistakes, and they are not expert in all fields. However, I disagree that parents are the best teacher. 

  First, parents do not point out their children’s mistakes because they have love and attachment for them. They do not see their children with objective views, so they find their children’s mistakes as well as correct their faults. When I ate with my family, children run around the restaurant and made a noise as if it is their house. Although the children’s behaviors had bad influences on other people, their parents do not scold them and angry to people who scold their children. 

  Second, parents are not the best teacher because their knowledge does not cover all fields. Although they have various experiences and wisdom for living, they lack expert knowledge on diverse areas such as art, science, and history. Therefore, they could give their children an erroneous knowledge or information, so it may have negative effects on them. If your children ask you what you do not know, you can not give them the right answer. Consequently, your children are disappointed with you, and you might lose your authority as parents. 

  In conclusion, it is fact that parents play an important role in their children’s life. However, they are related their children so closely that they overlook their mistakes or faults. Although parents give us much love and consideration, I disagree with this statement for the reasons I have mentioned above.     ",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts.",//,"There is a saying that ""There are two sides in each question"". This reflect that it can be correct whether reading books that based on real event or reading fiction. Some people think that reading real event is better to develop knowledge, while others say that reading fiction is better. From my point of view, reading a fiction is better in terms of inventiveness and fun. 

To begin with, fictions enable people to enjoy a book. For instance, most children do not like read a book Especially children who are in educational growing level. However, cartoon or fiction is diffent matter. A number of studies indicated that children do not want to read history. This reflect that children are like to read fiction. Authors can write their utopia to book. Thus, many people enjoy reading fiction. In this manner, people read a fiction or cartoon. 

In addition, fictions allow people to grow up imagenation. According to the survey conducted by ministrey of Infant Education in Korea more than 70percent of parents and children replied that fiction is better than book which is based on reality such as history. For example, fictions are composed of many lively description. It can help people building up good creativity. Also, fictions stimulate people to invent a number of worlds that anyone has never thought. Furthermore, cartoon, not based on real event, is one of the great sources of creativities. Children read even cartoon, their ability is gradually growing up. In this regard, people should read a book that is not based on reality. 

All in all, given the opportunity to choose between read a real and read a surreal, I would choose a surreal because fictions not only offer people fun but also develop creativity. We should keep in mind that what is more benefit for you.",//,essay,::

",//," I think that health means not only physical health, but also mental health.  Thus, if we maintain our healthful condition, we should carefully concern both conditions in our life.  There are many kinds of activities to maintain both our mental health and physical health.  However, in my case, be in my case, I mainly prefer to exercise in inline-skating and jogging for keeping my physical health, and prefer to listen to music and watch movies for keeping my mental health. 

        To begin with, I mainly practice inline-skating and jogging for an hour every day. Both activities are good choice for maintaining my health, and they are also inexpensive sports.  If you decide to enjoy inline-skate or jogging, you should buy some equipment such as inline boots, repairing tools, body-protectors, and a helmet for inline-sports, or jogging shoes for jogging. It would require some money to buy these things. However, when you buy these equipments, you don't need to spend any more equipment.  For example, a golf club membership in Korea is very expensive. Average prices of the golf club membership are at least eight millions won, so most people in Korea who already have basic golf equipments could not play golf. Of course, the basic golf equipments in Korea are also more expensive than any other country. However, inline-skating and jogging are not expensive sports in Korea. It is also fun and you don't have to pay extra money for skating or jogging. Moreover, both activities are very good for our health. Many doctors say that both sports are good for strengthening respiratory organs and heart, and both also good for improving muscle system of our body. 

        In addition, to relieve mental stress, I prefer to listen to music and watch movies. I am one of the jazz fans and movie fans. When I am stressful, I often go to the movie, or borrow some DVD from DVD store around my home, or listen to jazz music. When I hear jazz music or watch movies, I can relieve my stress and feel comfortable. Actually, I believe that most people do same act like me, because when people listen to merry music or movies, they can alleviate their bad feelings. Moreover, most doctors and psychologists agree that the effects of music and movies can help alleviate one's stress and even cure some serious mental disease such as manic-depressive psychosis, and melancholia. 

        In brief, No one may deny that importance of maintaining physical and mental health is essential for our life, and I believe that Inline skating, jogging, enjoying music and movies are best choices to maintain my life in best way. ",//,essay,::
Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Others choose to spend time with large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answer. ,//,"When we spend time with large number of friends, we get the chance to meet various kinds of people. This ables us to train social skill to easily adapt ourselves to different culture or taste. Also, gathering involving many people have a exciting atmosphere that can't be found in groups of small number of people. But I prefer to spend time with one or two close friends for the following reasons. 

  Firstly, spending time with small number of friends provides the comfort and intimacy that gathering of many people might lack. We often feel distressed from the overloaded work and become annoyed with so many people making noises in the restaurant. The comfort and intimacy we get from the gatherings of small number of people might relax our fatigue. 

  Secondly, during the time spending with one or two close friends, we can talk about serious matters and share useful information. Such serious problems seem hard to be shared among large number of people. Talking about problems with one or two close friends might be a good way to release the pressure of the problems. We might even realize the key to the next step of solving the problem. 

  Although there are a lot of advantages in spending time with many friends, I think the advantages of meeting one or two close friends overweigh them. And that is why I prefer to spend time with small number of friends. ",//,essay,::
 Is the ability to read and write more important today than in the past? Why or why not?   ,//,"Recently, our society is getting more and more complex and developed. There are so many attractive matters that we can see, hear and feel that it is easy for us to believe that reading and writing are not important as ever before. However, as far as I know, reading and writing are basic and fundamental tools for expressing oneself and understanding others because they help us arrange one's thought. In addition, as before, the most important way to give others information is not TV show or radio talk show, but reading materials such as journal or books. Thus, I think reading and writing are more important, and here are some reasons for my decision. 

First, it is usually helpful for us to write down what we think or imagine. This is because we can not wirte about something without considering and re-arranging one's idea. For example, every time I prepare test, without re-arranging class note, I could not make a good resualt. It seems that while I try to write down what I read form my class note, text book or some kind of material, the process of writing helps me establish heirachy of knowledge, which make it easy for me to memorize or understand information. 

Second, although seeing, hearing and feeling are important tools of understanding complex and huge amount of information, reading and writng are also important to transper one's knowledge or thought to others. This is because such media as TV, radio and movie can not be easily and deeply understood because we can not memorize or understand them relativly short period time. We can read or write until we fully understand or express. However, due to its speed and duration, it is hard for us to concentrate on that matter. 

In sum, althogh traditional way of understanding and expressing, reading and writing, seems somewhat outdated, they are fundamental and crucial tools of interacting with others.

"Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and laws that prohibit it should be upheld. ",//,"Smoking in restaurants is a selfish and disrespectful action for other people who came to the restaurant to enjoy their meal. There must be some people who dislike the smell of smoking so much that they can not have a meal with the smell of smoking. Also, it would disturb the people, who are trying to quit smoking. 

Moreover, as we all know, smoking affects second hand smokers in more harmful way than those who actually smokes. Because the restaurant is a place to enjoy a healthy meal, they are expected to be the places in a cleaner and better condition. It is obvious that no one likes to have a meal with the full of smoking. 

As a matter of fact, it is also very harmful and unhealthy for the smokers to eat their meal while they are smoking. By restricting the laws that prohibit people to smoke in the public area, the government or state leister can expect a less number of people who smokes, to keep a society and citizens away from bad influences and effects and also to help smokers quit smoking more conveniently. 

Not only a restaurant, but also other public buildings should not allow people smoking, and more importantly, smokers should realize that their actions of smoking where other people are, is irresponsible therefore should feel ashamed and guilty. ",//,essay,::
It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay. ,//,"I agree that it is good for children to grow up in the countryside that give many good points. Although people know that the nature is the best textbook for children, they cannot give it to them for many reasons. The good points which can could gain from raising children in the countryside are the life in the natural which give a rest and a health, the friends who have a intimate friendship, and the best educational experiences which can not imagine in the city. 

The children in the city are dependent and weak even in mental. However, the children in the countryside are independent in whatever they do and strong in not only physical but also mental. While the children in the city are surrounded by bad air, various accidents in daily life and many dangerous things, the children in the countryside can have a nice day with a fresh air, a beautiful natural and a peaceful mind. 

The friendship in the city’s children is changeable and beatable by trivial reasons. For the children in the city can have many various friends as like videogame which can be exchanged when they disgust it, they could not make a real and deep relationship with their friends. In the countryside, for the children have not sufficient toys as city’s children, they have to have perseverance and a faith to make a friend. The friendship which be formed by this course is strong and would be sustained for a long time. 

While the children in the city have knowledge which learn from a textbook or an Internet, the children in the countryside can have knowledge from a real experience, which cannot do, in the city. The city’s children have only fast and useless knowledge, however the countryside’s children can have a live and real knowledge by their experience with the natural and self-stimulation. 

In conclusion, Although I have a difficulty in making a decision to raise children in the countryside for job and relationships with colleagues who I have known for long time, if I have a chance and make up a mind resolutely, many good things would be returns for children and also me; the children could obtain a health, an intimate friendship and a best educational environment in the countryside.

Your school has enough money to purchase either computers for students or books for the library. Which should your school choose to buy computers or books?  Use specific reasons and examples to support your recommendation.,//,"  I think that both to buy books and computers have some advantages and disadvantages. If my school has a plan to buy something for the school library between books and computers, I would suggest to buy computers for the library, because computers are effective and convenient equipments for most students in terms of accessing up-to-date information, processing information quickly, and utilizing many kinds of school works. 

        First of all, students who work with computers can access up-to-date information. For example, our university library already has a wide variety of books, but most books only contain out-of-date information. Thus, students without computers hardly catch up with up-to-date technologies. Of course, students can ask a librarian to apply some books, which students need, but the process is mostly complex and time-consuming. However, if students can use a computer, these inconvenient things would be solved by computers, because students using computers can easily connect a school network system and Internet, and they can easily find information, which they need. 

        Secondly, students who work with computers can process much information in real time. For instance, if you want to find some books without computers in the library, you would spend a lot of time to find an index card, and to know that the book is still there or lended.  Maybe to find a book would take at least ten minutes without help of the computer. However, if you use a computer, you can direct search the book that you need, and you can get the book in no time. Of course, if you use Internet, you can also find a wide variety of information such as research papers, latest articles, and news in no time. Thus, students with computers can access information more quickly than students without computers. 

        Lastly, computers can be used in a wide variety of school works. For example, now, nowadays students use computers for research and word processing needs. Some teachers use computers for providing their course homework and information.  Moreover, many universities in Korea require students to learn computer, because the process of application of the course are completely computerized. My university also has computerized enrolling system. If the university buys many computers, students who don’t have a computer would be easily enrolled in the course, which they want. 

        In conclusions, I strongly believe that computers would be best choice to greatly improve the environment of the library. Even though books are simple to read, and they do not need such knowledge of the computer, I am sure that quickness-ability, access-ability, and wide application-ability of the computer are more valuable than books.

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. Use specific reasons and details to support your opinion. 
   ",//,"It is needless to say that most books are written by those who have their own respective thoughts and want to have the books to be read by many other people. Simultaneously, the contents of the books should be different to each other. I am for sure it is good to have plenty of thoughts and philosophies in the world so that we can share them. Therefore, I am for the statement that people need to read both fiction and non-fiction for a couple of reasons. It will be viewed from following two aspects. 

  Firstly, one of the critical reasons why people should read both books about real events and unreal events is that we can learn to know what other people are thinking by reading the both kinds of books. The thoughts of other people could be about real phenomena or creative ideas. For example, had it not been for the novel of Aldous L. Huxley, Brave New World, we couldn't even have a chance to imagine how tragic the world would be if the science technology had been developed without conscience. Thanks to the very creative fiction, people in 1932 could be inspired to think about the future. I don't think any other facts in the book can do better to do it than the novel. To sum, people had better have access to other people's creation by reading various kinds of books not just by reading non-fiction. 

  Secondly, the creative thoughts of children should be boosted by a lot of great fiction. We all know that children have much curiosity and try to meet their needs by reading, watching and tasting and so on. I think novels, such as science fiction and fables are very much adequate to satisfy kids. My brother, who majors in shipbuilding technology at the moment, dreamed about becoming a good scientist when he was very young with reading various kinds of scientific novels. I think this could be a good example how much children are affected by creative works of good authors. The creative thoughts of children should not be eroded; instead, it has to be enhanced by good fiction. 

  In conclusion, people have to read fiction as well as established facts because all people want to and have right to share ideas with other great contemporary thinkers and writers. Futhermore, vast imaginary stuff in fiction can develope creativeness of children. That we have many a good novels, which stimulates our imagination, is very adorable in this mechanical and highly standardized society. ",//,essay,::
Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? ,//,"When you travel to new place, where is the first place that you want to visit?

Then, what could be your first stop, if there is no such famous place that attracts you? In my case, generally I take museum as the first stop for my visit because I can understand that area easily, fast and effectively. In addition, museum gives me unforgettable memories. 

First, the most fast and easy way to understand a certain area is to visit museum. We can learn brief history of that area by seeing historical stuff displayed at the museum. What's more, we can find out how that area's economic and cultural status is. In most case, if a certain local government is not in good cultural or economic state, the government tend not to invest on such faculties such as museum. It is because, to them, there are many things they have to invest first. On the contrary, if the local government and that area is flourishing, it is clear that they cherish their historical stuff. 

In addition, we can make some memories about certain place by visiting museum. We can see valuable historical remains that can not be seen at the other area. Furthermore, considering that museum plays an important role of being landmark of the area, we can experience fantastic building and landscape. For example, when I visit "" the Louvre"", what makes me exciting is not only its stuff, but also its building including glass pyramid. If I toured the city without visiting that museum, half of my memories could be lost in my mind. 

In sum, although visiting museum might seem to be somewhat boring, it is quite a useful way of understanding certain area. Museum is abstract of the area's history, culture and life. Without visiting local museum, how can you say that you visit and learn lots of things on that area?

English as an official language. ,//,"Korea achieved brilliant success last 30 years. This miracle was come from perspiration of all people in Korea, especially the laborer who worked at the factory paying low-wage and poor environment. As economy grows rapidly, people concern about whether Korea can become more affluent or not. In Korea’s circumstance where natural resources are limited, talented people need to be trained. With part of that worries, some people urge to use English as an official language. It is inevitable to Korea to survive from globalization which accelerates competitiveness among the nations. How ever, in my opinion, finding our national characteristics is more important than following advanced nations recklessly. 

One of the biggest concerns is that we could lose our emotion of nation. We have more than 2,000 years of history and always proud of our nation. In 2002 World Cup, for instance, Korea showed intensive nationalism throughout the world. We all dressed red shirts and proud of what we made. Another example of our self-esteem is ‘Han-Gul’ which is Korea’s official language. Han-Gul is the perfect language that expresses every human feelings in words and also write every language that people use all over the world. It is a creditable invention that the world language experts acclaimed it. 

In addition, imagine of how impractical of using English in Korea society. How do you going to write Korean’s peculiar thinking? As an example of Korean novel, there are good novels in Korea which could not award novel prize at literature, because Han-Gul could not interpret properly. 

In conclusion, Using English as an official language does not mean fostering national competitiveness. Korea government should devise other alternatives that increase national benefits such as improving educational surroundings or lessening restrict policy to companies so that they can help domestic consumption. Also, People should conserve their cultures and prepare for the globalization. If not, we could be a cultural colony of other advanced nations. ",//,essay,::

They like those place because thay can save time and don't have to worry making food. Despite opposition from many, I prefer to eat food at home. 

First of all, I am able to save a lot of money. Because I'm student, I am not able to afford food price at restaurants 30 days a month and 12 months a year. It was  always my parents who gave a pocket money to me. I realized that the older we are , the more difficult we get a money from parents. Even if I have money to go chow hall, I have tried to keep the money in bank for my future. When we eat food at home, It’s possible to store food that we left. It’s a common sense that most of restaurants have dumped the food away right after customers set off from restaurants. It not only made environmental problems, but also raised the food price. I saw one article in newspaper that government and private companies spent two billion won to recover the environment. I also want to mention about tip culture. It’s recommended to leave 10~15% of your whole food price on the desk, when you leave the restaurant. If the waiter impressively served to you, you would like to leave more money than regular tips. 

  Secondly, eating at home is more safe than restaurant, or food stall. Generally speaking, most restaurants more interest money than any other things. One broadcaster reported the news that most of the fast-food store’s sanitations are terrible. Part time job members usually didn’t  wash their hands when they start working and didn’t use a plastic glove.  A  worker said that a host just always has pushed him to work quickly and didn’t say anything about safty of making food. As you can see, your mother always tries to make healthy food for family members. Whenever she was about to buy some ingredients, she looked carefully about the expiration and the condition of food not the price of that. As a result, Family members are able to feel mother’s love. 

Thirdly, family members can share the feeling of membership. We are so busy with our own businesses that we are no longer interested with  the lives of our near and dear ones.  So I think  that the best way to solve this problem is to make a custom about eating at home at least one time a day. I am sure that they will feel the safety and comfort  each other. 

As we have seen above, there are many benefits eating food at home. It’s not only good to your health, but also good to relationship of family members. ",//,essay,::
It is sometimes said that borrowing money from a friend can harm or damage friendship. Do you agree? Why or why not? Use specific examples to explain your answer.,//,"There is an argument regarding the issue that lending or borrowing money from a friend can damage the friendship. Some people maintain that this behavior don’t affect friendship. However, in my opinion, borrowing money from my friends can affect negatively our friendship because this can damage my friend’s financial statement and might break confidence between friends. 
    First of all, if a person borrow some money from his or her fiend, it can give trouble to the friend because of the financial problem. For example, I am a university student and I earned money by doing part-time job to afford my tuition. In this case, I always have trouble in my financial statement. Two months ago, one of my friends answered me to lend one hundred dollars and I lent the money despite my condition for my friend and consequently I got in financial trouble. Hence, through the experience, I learned that borrowing money from a friend can damage the friendship. 
    Moreover, borrowing money can attack the confidence between friends. If a friend who borrowed some money don’t pay back the money, people might think that the friend doesn’t consider them. According to the research done by the Seoul National University in Korea, people feel sorry when their friends don’t do thoughtfully. To make the matter worse, once the truth is broken between friends, the relation can’t maintain as before. After all, friends break up the relationship each other. Therefore, I think that borrowing money can harm the relationship between friends.   
     In conclusion, I agree the statement that borrowing money from a friend can affect negatively friendship. This is because of the reasons mentioned above that borrowing can affect directly the financial statement of a friend and might reduce the belief between friends. We should make an effort not to borrow money from friends to keep the friendship.   ",//,essay,::

Students need one long vacatoin to perform these things. But several short vacations are too short to do them. It is important for students  to have a vacation as rechaging time. so, I think that students should be given one long vacation each year. 

      There are no one that undstand perpactly all the subjects in semester. So, students that have a vacation supplement their depiciency of a subject in a semester. It also means that students prepare next semester. To perform these things, students are reqired many times. If student are given Several short vacations, just they have to supplement a subject and prepare next semester. Students don't  need only astudying time but also  a enjoying time. 

      Students have a right to enjoy their life because they are not studying machine. Students have their times that they can utilize after ending a semester. In this time, they can do many things. For example, some students travel with a friend and some students learn to play the piano that cann't do in a semester. students that cann't live with family in semester have a happy time with thier family during a vacation. Students are helped mentall and physic growth throgh these process. If students are given a short vacations, these things are impossible because of too short time. That's reason why student should be given one long vacation. 

     If it is considered only by quantity, both several short vacatoins and one long vacation are same. However,  Several differences Beteen several short vacatoins and one long vacation clearly exist. A vacation is essencial time to rechage life of students. Therefore, I think that students should be given one long vacation each year. ",//,essay,::
"Holidays honor people or events. If you could create a new holiday, what person or event would it honor and how would you want people to celebrate it? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. 

",//," Have you ever heard about Taekwondo? I think you have probably heard it before because it is one of the most famous fighting arts and it is selected an offical game of the olympics. In my country, korea, there isn’t a holiday for Taekwondo even though it is very important for us. If I can make a holiday, I really want to choose Taekwondo. And I want to celebrate it with advertising and making a world tournament 

     Taekwondo is a fighting game from Korea. It looks similar to Kungfu from China and Karade from Japan. However, it has own arts. Especially it use legs very efficiently and fantastically. So many people fall in love with wonderful skills and it has become one of the famous games all over the world. In the world, there are a lot of branchs of Taekwondo. One of my European friends, from Latvia, he used to be a Taekwondo player. He had trained it for 7 years so his body was great. In korean opinion, how proud it is. I have never thought many of the world people love it. Even it is now a famous game in Olympics. There are many fighting games but just Taekwondo and Boxing are selected as official games in Olympics. In these point, we korean feel proud about it. It is important for us, neverthless, in korea there isn’t a holiday for it. So I need to make a holiday for it. 

   If  I made a holiday for it, I should make events for it. How to? I think it has become a famous game all over the world. So I would make a world tournament. Of course there is other worlds tournaments like olympics but I want different kind of competition. First, I need to advertise it. In my country sometimes something weird events have happened. They were very important but the administrator of the events didn’t prepare for the events and didn’t advertise very well. Eventually the events caused anger from people. I have seen many times like it. So I would try to advertise efficiently for it such as TV commercials. 

    If  I can make a holiday for something, as I said I would make Taekwondo day for my country and korean. Because we korean feel proud from it. However we don’t have a holiday for it. So I think It is actually needed thesedays for Korea. To celebrate, I would make a world tournament. How great it is, it is for korean but also it can be a celebration all over the world’s people.

What are some of the qualities of a good parent? Use specific details and examples to explain. ,//," These days there are a lot of education systems. They teach how to teach their children and to educate them to make smart. However, it is pretty hard to find about some materials which explain about being a good parent. So I wanted to say what some of the quialities of a good parent are. I think good parents have to show their passion about what they are doing, generosity and they have not to make an unhappy family. Let me tell you specifically about them. 

     One of the features of the good parent is that they show that they are doing their best whatever they do. It is really important. From a baby to adult, children see his parents during his life. As growing, children are realizing what they should do from their environment. One of the most important things which effect them is of course his father and mother. If his father shows that his best and passion about something. It will effect his sons and daughters as good advantages. 

    Another point I think is that usually good parents are very generous. If father shows mercy for the poor, children will learn how to mercy someone. If he shows just his passion about something, his sons and daughters will learn just a passion from his father and mother not generosity. It means it is possible children will be selfish. 

    The last point I think is that the good parents don’t make unhappy for their family. Economical capablity is also important and their personality is also important. However, I think the most important thing is that good parent make their family very happy. Some good parents never fight in front of children. It is sure that they are trying to make a happy family. Usually a guy who does criminal is from an unhappy family. When parents fight each other, statistics shows children suffer a lot of stress. It makes them to go out of the houses. 

     To be a good parent, they should make happy family. To be a good parent, they have to show their passion to their children. Itself will be a good education. To be a good parent, they should teach what generosity is to prevent their children from being selfish. What are more important? I think that these are the most important things to be a good parent. I don’t mean there aren’t other important things. But I believe when a good parent shows these for their children,  their children will grow happily and learn how to live will in a society.

Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your anwer. ,//,"  This topic has been pretty contraversial. Many students have insisted on studying alone is better but others have affirmed conversly. Which opinion is right or better for us? Maybe it depends on student’s style. However, for most students, I recommend them to study with a group. Thesedays I have studying alone. I, however, feel that I can study more efficiently. How? I think if I study with a group, I could tell what my problem is so I could think logically. I could enjoy studying. And I could study efficiently? How and why? Let me tell you my opinion. 

      As you might know, now I am studying TOEFL and preparing for some tests. These test are not easy and I sometimes feel embarassed because of hard questions which require highly logical thinking. For example, at reading parts on TOEFL, I usually have some problems on inferrence questions. Sometimes I can’t solve and understand even if I see the answers. What do you think of my problem? I think this problem is caused by a lack of logical thinking. I have thought if I have a group studying with me, we could make discussing and tell what our problems are. I believe we can make better logical ability by great discussing. 

     Who does love study and want to study? Actually there aren’t students like that. Sometimes we could feel that a part of study is very interesting. However, It usually can’t last for a long time. I think when we study alone, we could feel very bored. Sometimes we need to discuss and ask someone about hard questions. When we meet hard questions which we can’t solve by ourselves, we feel bored and frustrated. At this time we lost our interests for studying. Sometimes we need a rival and want to enjoy a competition. Like that, we can match with my friends in the group. It would be good reason to study for bored students. 

     There is another reason I prefer to study with a group. This makes studies very efficiently. How did we do? We made penaltys. What kinds of penaltys? Let me tell you. When I studied with my friends, we made a penalty like paying money when we couldn’t memorize vocaburaries for homework. It was not big money. However, for us, it was big deal even if the money was not expensive. So we  could study them very hard and eventually memorize a whole vocaburary book. How useful it is! In this point, if there is spontaneous penalty, it would make our study more efficiently. 

     If we can make better logical thinking, if we can prevent to study from boring, and if we can make study very efficiently by a penalty, then we could study very interestingly and hard. History and statistics have shown appropriately strict rules and competitions make our ability for something better. As I told you, these reasons I think are significantly good ways to study if we can. ",//,essay,::
Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your anwer. ,//," To study effectively, some students prefer to study alone, and others prefer to study with a group of students, If I have a chance to choose between studying alone and studying with friends, I would choose a group study, because later has more advantages than studying alone. 

        To begin with, a group study can help students improve effectiveness in the study.  For example, when you study alone, it would be very hard to collect many kinds of research materials in short time by him or her. However, if you study with a group of students, the group member can split and share their school-assignments and research materials.  Thus, each member of the group can save his or her time to finish homework, and can get much information in short time. Moreover, many students can get their research from different sources such as newspapers, Internet, and books, so they can get also a wide variety of information in no time. 

        In addition, students who joined a group study can improve his or her social skills such as interpersonal relationship, intercommunication, and friendship. For instance, students who study with friends can learn responsibility by taking a position in the study group, so the student can develop a sense of responsibility. Moreover, they can learn how to organize the study team, the way to study, and study time. If a student only prefers to study alone, he or she can’t get a chance to learn social skills and improve intercommunication abilities. 

        For these reasons, I prefer to study with a group of students. Group study can give students many opportunities as I mentioned above. Students who do group study can learn social skills and can work efficiently. Of course, studying alone would be a good choice for some students who are very shy or don’t want to be interrupted by other students. However, in my case, a group study is best choice for me.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.   ,//,"People has regarding the issue that parents are the best teachers. some people think that parents doesn't offer children good education. while, others have opposite opinion. I believe that children are learned by their parents who are best teacher for children because parents not only know their children but also  lead them very well. 
     
    First of all, parents allow their children to find their talent or interest .In general, children have spent a lot of time with their parent from the day of birth. as parents live with their children together for a long time, they can look for everything about their children as well as this can take full advantage of  children's ability. for example. I'll take personal experience. during my high school years, when I was wondering  about my future, my parent were good assistant since they give me information that I don't know yet such as my interest, appeals, talent and so on. as a result, I could easier make a plan than others of the same age. this shows that parents helps their children to recognize themselves. 

   Second, because of unconditional love, children can follow their parents willingly. generally speaking, children not only spend most time with their parents but also they are related by blood with each other. thus both parents and children become having belief. It is certain that children depend on their parents. for good education, between teachers and students should be based on these relationship. in other words these relationship offer them lots of care and love. parents can lead easily their children. 

   In sum, I know that the best teachers are parents because parents know their children. in addition, they can easier guide than others. it is necessary to be a good teacher. for better education, teachers should know that students need continuous concern and love.

Some people believe that students should be given one long vacation each year. Others believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? ,//," What would you do during vacation if you were to come back to school days? People have different ideas depending on their situations. I believe that one long vacation, not several short vacations, should be given to students because one long vacation can give time to build up work experience, time to travel and time to study their subjects. 

    First, students can have an opportunity to work as an intern during long vacations. By doing so, they can apply what they learn at school to a real working situation. If you are majoring in advertising, then you can work at advertising firm, such as LG Ad (well-known advertising company in Korea), as a creative designer, and really involve in making advertisements. I also had worked as an intern at a consulting firm during my vacation in my junior year and it was really a great time. 

    Secondly, one long vacation is good for students to travel around to the places they want to know more. As you may know, when you work with a company, you cannot have your time for a travel. In Korea, workers can take a trip for 7 days to at most 10 days in a consecutive. On the contrary, students can make the best use of their vacation to visit cities abroad. If you are interested in making movies, I strongly recommend you look around MGM studio and Universial studio where you can find how the movies are made.  During my freshman, I had a good chance to go to America. At that time, I visited the Ivy League School, for example Harvard University, Yale University and Princetone University and so on. I could see the beautiful campuses and also could talk with students there about their school life. 

    Finally, students can review what they learnt during their previous semester and make up for what they missed. In addition, students can work in advance what they want to study and prepare for the next semester. One friend of mine took a summer course to make up for what she failed at a freshman year, and eventually she could raise up her graduate point average to the level she wanted. 

     In short, I agree with the statement that one long vacation would be good for students because students can have working experience, visit countries they want and study what they learnt and prepare for the next semester during that time. ",//,essay,::
"In some countries teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion  using specific reasons and details. 

",//,"Many people say that having jobswhile they are still students are not good for disturbing the study. However, l think that having a job while they are still teenager is a good ideat that have many advantage. There are several reasons to support my opinion. 

Firstly, as having a jobs during teenegers, they can catch the thing what is really they adapted. Almost people who are just learn their study in school tend to can't find eaily what kind of job is the most adatped to them after graduate school. However, people have an experience like having a job in teenager, he or she can know about their temperament. For example, whether they like to follow the commend of boss or not. In addition, they may catch what kind of work they like. For instance, when a boy work in fast-food during teenager, he know about whether he likes and is good at selling articles.
   
Sedondly, having a job teenegers in still students is a good idea because they can have an experience before they got a fail in real society after graduate a school. When a teenager who want to get a whose food-market, he or she get a job relative with food-market when they are teenager. As having that kind of a job when he or she duing still student, he or she can learn many knowledge such as the most important things or threaten things before the person manage own the food-market. 
     
Thirdly, having a job teenagers in still stuednt is a good idea because they can apply the knowledge that was learnd in the class to real situation. For instance, a curious teenager is taughted about the supply and demend in an economy class. While he or she have a job that can get a item from a firm and sell to people, he or she can know certainly what is the real supply and demend. 

In sum, having a job when they are teenagers is good idea because they can have not only an opportunity to find what is their fiber, but also an experience apply their knowledge that are taughted in class to real circumstance. In addition, they can have an pre-exercise that can reduce the possibility to fail rather than they are graduate their school.",//,essay,::
"Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. 
   ",//,"There are many ways that we can study. It is very important how to study. some people say that students should study alone with high concentration. However, from my point of view, studying in a group of students is better in terms of saving time and sharing imformation.  

   To begin with, not all students solve problems. That is to say, every student has a advantage and a disadvantage in study skill. Hence, studying in a group enable students to save of time by effective ways. For my experience, I study TOFLE in a group which is 8 members together. Due to I have a more ability in listening comprehention than others, I can teach other members. In contrast I can learn part of others. We able to save many times because We only catch our unknown problems. We need not to consider unsolved problems. in this regard, group studying help us saving of time. 

    Moreover, group studying allow students to feel interesting. in other words alone studying is very boring and have a loosing mind. For instance, our study group have a pop quiz every mornig. pop quiz enable us to study hard. also it give us some of belonging. hence we can more good results. also as we debate a difficult problems with our diverse opinion. In this regard, study group is necessary with effective studying. 

In short, I firmly believe that students should study organization making in a study group. this is because studying all together is effective ways in terms of saving time and interesting studying.",//,essay,::
"Many people have a close relationship with their pets. These people treat their birds, cats, or other animals as members of their family. In your opinion, are such relationships good? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ",//," Since ancient times, many people had close relationships with their pets such as birds, cats, and dogs. Thus, I agree that to have close relationships with their pets are good for both people and animals, because such relationships contain some advantages. 

        To begin with, close relationships with their pets can help some people having serious mental disease to alleviate it, because when they spend their time with their pets, they can feel more comfort than before. For these effects, most psychologists suggest their patients to raise pets, because raising pets can slow disease rate, alleviate bad mood-condition, and even cure disease. For example, I have a grandmother who had a serious breast cancer. Two years ago, she had a big surgical operation, and finally, she can remove cancer from her breast. However, after a medical operation, she got a serious pain. She wanted to relieve pain, so she used many kinds of medicine, but there were no way to alleviate her pain by medicine. However finally she overcame a pain, because she decided to raise dogs. After having a close relationship with her dogs, she can forget her pain and concentrate her interest of her pets. 
Nowadays, my grandmother sometimes feels pain, but now she feels better than before. 

        In addition, close relationship with their pets can prevent loneliness. For example nowadays many people live alone, and most people want to seek a way to forget loneliness. For these reasons, some people spend their time to meet other people, or more concentrate their jobs. However, the most popular way to overcome loneliness is buying a pet such as a dog and cat.

Teachers should not make their social or political views known to students in the classroom.,//,"At the same time as the advancement of the society, the argument as to the scope of a right for teachers to express their political viewpoints in classroom has taken place. Regarding this, some people are advocating that teacher is able to show their opinion on political issues during classes. However, I am of the strong belief that the opposite is right due to its power to distort the class and the student's susceptibilty  to the teacher.
 
The first reason which is exceptionally evident is that political view in class could distort the contents of the academic subjects such as ethics, history, and so on. To be specific, if the teacher gives a lecture about some social issues or literatures adding his or her own political meaning, the students are likely to accept academics in a biased position. From my persnoal experience, my history teacher in high school usually taught us a few important historic events from the progressive viewpoints. Because of this, we used to think that our society should be drastically changed in most fields without rational reasons. In this regard, teaching with political stances would have a negative impact on the growth of the youth's mind.
 
Another equally important reason is that the student is very susceptible to teacher's thoughts. To elaborate, the students who are not mature enough to judge social or political phenomenon tend to follow teacher's opinion blindly, which can be an obstacle to the development of democracy in our state. According to a study conducted on the politics of adult by the Korea University, it has been reported that nearly 55% of the adults who are now a member of political parties responded that their politics have been significantly influenced by the teacher's political view in classes. As can be seen, it is obvious that teacher's social or political thoughts could affect students.
 
To wap it up, admittedly teachers have the rights to hold and mention their opinion on social or political things. However, looking at all statements above, if in the classroom, it is undeniable that its negative effects outweigh the favorable outcome of it.",//,essay,::
"“In difficult situation, the teacher who give me hope and dream”",//,"When I was the third grade of high school, I got an extra-curricular English teacher. And I worked harder, but it was not able to pick up my English grade.
 
I failed to get into the college and then I had to repeat college entrance exam. I went to my parents and I said “ Dad! Mom! I will take up the challenge of retaking the entrance examination! ” and then my mom and dad had no say and there was silence in the room. I expected a positive answer. But my parents said that “Young Suk, It is not a good idea, we can’t agree with your opinion. If you would repeat college entrance examination, It is not guaranteed to improve grade for 1 year.“ this answer did not satisfy me.  My parent‘s character is realistic and skeptical. Sometime it hurts me.
 
After I seriously struggled with the matter, I decided to try to repeat college entrance examination through self-teaching myself, despite of the objections of my parents. I told my parent about my plan. My parents did not say anything.  I was to study the reading room near my house. I went there with pack lunches, because I did not have money. I studied alone except for English. I had courage to call my extra-curricular teacher who taught me before and I called. At that instant, the telephone was trembled as my heart. Though the receiver, I said “Teacher ! I am Young Suk. I decided to study for college entrance examination again. But, it is difficult to study English alone . Can you help me? Actually I don’t have any money but If you help me, I will repay for your favor!!”  Centainly it was rude request to teacher. I felt shame and nervous . But I had  little hope.  Surprisingly, the teacher’s response was favorable. Teacher said that “ Are you trying again examination for college entrance? Oh I feel sorry. Okay let try again with me! After 10 minutes, can I meet you at McDonalds on the Academic streets?” I was very surprised and I replied loudly “Yes, I can!!” After a while, I went to McDonald on the Academic streets. Even my teacher arrived faster than me. I opened the door with a heart pounding. I greeted gladly teacher. “Hello! Teacher!!! It is been a long time. Nice to meet you” my teacher was reading the English newspaper and said “ Hi ! Young Suk!! “
 
We were going to have one study meeting per week, because he was a postgraduate student at that time. I thanked him a lot. Thanks him, I felt that I could pass the examination right now. After we ended our talking, we walked on the Academic streets. When I walked alone on the Academic streets, I always felt lonely. However, today, thanks to the teacher walking with me, I felt better and more confident than ever before.
 
 The teacher always taught me English thoroughly and efficiently. And when I asked something about English he always taught kindly like an older brother. Once, I could not remember a certain word exactly. I tried remembering the word exactly. However, I was not able to remember the word. Eventually, I sent the clues about the word the teacher. And then after a while, he sent the exact word. The teacher was so nice to me. I appreciated a lot of the teacher and I decided that “I will repay for his kindness and I should be the man like him”
 
He majored in Economics at the University. When he had to decide, he always thought rationally. When he bought products, after comparing product’s price and function thoroughly, he decided to buy. Once, we went to market to buy Coke. After he compared bottle Coke’s price, quantity and can Coke’s price, quantity, he said “Both price were same.” And then he picked up the can Coke. I was wondering and I asked “Many people like the bottle Coke. But why do you choose the can Coke?” And he replied “Both Coke’s price is same. The bottle Coke easily exit the bubble, while the can Coke do not get out of the bubble easily. And he said “Many people buy products without price comparison. Young Suk, when you buy a product, it is not wise to buy without price comparison. It is the theory of the price comparison in Economics.” After that, when he purchased products, he liked mathematical calculations. He was so nice to me and he was very rational person
 
He sometime taught me the theory of Economics and introduce that Economics is how useful in everyday life. He looked like so smart through my eyes. At that moment, I thought that “I should be the man who is smart and kind like my teacher. And I will major in Economics!“ and As I told him that I will major in Economics, he really was pleased and encouraged me “ Young Suk, I am sure that You will be the best Economics student !” He always encouraged me.    
 
Our class was continued in September. Although from September to November, I had to study alone, I did not feel lonely or fear. Instead of that, I felt confident. In November, I applied for the Korea SAT. And then I received my report card. At the instant, I could not stop talkin. My grade was improved especially in English! I decided to apply for Economics at University. My parents seriously worried that about my applying because It was difficult to admission to Economics. However, this time, my parent believed me. My admission was not guaranteed. The day of the announcemen, I tried to check my result with trembling heart. As the result, I got a admission in Economics! I was very happy. That night, my family enjoyed the party. And I reminded my teacher.

However, I strongly believe that the reason of sports are popular, we get a lot of positive things during playing a sport because when we play game, our body is much healthier than before and we can get many relationships.
 
           First of all, when we play sport, our body is always getting healthier. In my case, when I was middle school student, I was week. My lung is too week to run long time. At that time, my father recommended me to jog every morning. Actually, first I started jogging, I couldn’t finish the goal. However, whenever I jogged, my lung and my legs were getting stronger than before. Finally, I could get to the goal without problems.

           In addition, while we are playing a sport, we can get huge relationships because, if we go to the sport club, we can meet a lot of people. In my friend’s case, his hobby was hiking and he was a member of Clark Hiking Club. So he usually hiked the mountain with his friend’s. Whenever he hiked, he could get a lot of friends. At that time, his mother was hurted by a huge car accident, he met a huge problem about taking care of his mother. It was very hard work, however, his hiking club friends started to help him treat her. As a consequence, his mother was healed perfectly.

"In order to stay well-informed, people should get information from various news source.",//,"There has been an argument regarding the issue that people who want to stay well-informed should get information from various news source. There are myriads of people insist that people in modern days get too much information, so it is enough to read one kinds of news. But, from my perspective, it is essential to read various kinds of news source to get well-informed.  

First of all, todays news sources are specialized in their particular fields. A economic newspaper is write the article especially about the economic issues. In case of sports and entertainments are in the same situation. If people want to we-informed, people should earn information from different kinds of news source. To illustrate, research conducted by Korea University verified that specialization of news sources are getting deeper and deeper. That means if people want to know properly, it is necessary to get information from a wide array of news sources.  

Secondly, many news sources are reflecting the certain social tendency. If we keep getting information from one news source, there are possibility to affect our idea to be bigoted. To be adequately informed, people should get to know the different viewpoint of sources from different kinds of news. For example, South Korea News Committee informed that the tendency of news sources of South Korea is divided into 3 categories. Their character reflects the owner's certain viewpoint about the politic. That illustrates that in order to get balanced knowledge, people try to understand various of viewpoint from various news source.  

To sum up, it is imperative to get information from different kinds of news source. It is because that todays news are too specialized, and some news sources are bigoted. By getting information from different news sources, people can stay well-informed. ",//,essay,::
Reading books is a more satisfying pastime than watching movies.,//,"Some people might argue that watching TV is a more useful hobby than reading books. It is because people can get rid of stress when they watch TV. However, I believe that reading books is a more fulfilling hobby for two reasons. First, people can broaden their views. Second, reading books improves work efficiency.
 
First of all, reading books can allow people to broaden their horizon. By reading a lot of books, they can learn about different worlds of lifestyles, basic customs and cultures. It is obvious that they may go through trial and error. However, they can learn to embrace diversity through this experience. For example, when I had a part-time job, there was an Ethiopian girl who brought home-cooked meals for lunch. She ate with her hands without using utensils, and other students who had never seen such a scene kept their distances from her. On the other hand, being educated on Africa and African table manners through various books, I was perfectly understanding and comfortable with what was taking place.
 
In addition, reading books can encourage people to work with more passion. This is attributed the fact that it can serve as one of the key motivators for them to perform better and to improve themselves. With such motivation, they put in more effort, concentrate better on their tasks, and feel a greater sense of responsibility for their work. According to a research conducted by the Ministry of Labor in 2009, there was a huge difference between two groups of employees in relation to their achievement. Employees in Group A who regularly read books and those in Group B did not. The researchers showed that the former group spent 25% more number of hours on working and performed higher than the latter group. In particular, the employees in Group A followed instructions, submitted assignments on time, and participated actively in group meetings. On the other hand, those in Group B dozed off and lacked focus while working. It can be inferred that reading books frequently has a direct correlation with the amount of effort and energy that employees invest in working.

"Do you agree or disagree?
Universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries.",//,"Some argue that university is designed for academic reasons only. Advocates of this argument would resist the idea of university expanding budgets for promotion of physical activities. However, I believe that physical health which is promoted by sports activities lead to better academic performance and triggers healthy social network and relationship with one another.

Good physical condition which leads to excellent academic performance is well-proved concept through many studies. One research revealed that students who worked out regularly had much better academic performance by 20% than those students who didn't. The study further explained that physical activities lubricates the brain to function in perfect condition, making it in perfect condition to study better. This is why universities should not underestimate the effect of investing money on sports activities. Therefore, universities should provide proper environment for students to exercise on regular basis by putting much money and effort on sports.

Not only sports activities promote physical condition which eventually affect positively on academic performance, it also triggers healthy interaction between students. Most sports games such as soccer and football are designed to play in group. Thus, while playing with many people, students naturally interact with each other and easily make friends. For example, football season was the one of the best time in my college life, as it was good opportunity for me to hang out with friends and meet new people. Bunch of friends went to the football stadium and watch the game cheering our team together. It was a chance to get closer to friends I have, and build new friendship.

To sum up, universities should put enough money to provide adequate environment for students to work out. This is as important as investing money on library since physical health is relevant to better academic performance and sports offer students to socialize. In this regard, I completely agree with the statement.

It is better to work three days a week for long hours than to work five days for shorter hours.,//,"First of all, it is much beneficial for today`s people to work three days a week for long hours because they can be allowed to take a long distance trip. It means that they are able to take a trip all around world because visiting other countries requires at least three days, which would be impossible for people who work five days a week. In addition, as they visit many other countries, it can make them to improve their perspectives greatly and help them to reduce their mental stress from work. For example, since a friend of mine works on his own business, he can manage his leisure time well as he wants. So, he have visited many other countries, which as a result it allows him to better understand other cultures, perspectives, and to meet a lot of new people from other countries. These experiences really help him to broaden his social network and to be successful in his business. Through this experience, I strongly believe that spending three days a week has more positive effect on people.

second, going to workplaces for five days a week really makes people tired and to get stressed. In modern society, most people have their own cars and there are scores of transportation such as buses or taxies. So, it can be frequently seen that traffic jams during rush hours, which as a result causes people to get stressed. Stress is the main cause of diseases, short life span, and dissatisfying life. Therefore, working five days a week have negative effect on people`s lives. According to the study done by New York Times, it revealed that the most contributing factor to make workers to get stressed was a traffic jam during rush hours. They also answered that staying at their own cars or buses for long times on the road made them really tired. Through this study, it is clearly proved to me that working five days a week is much beneficial.",//,essay,::
Advantages of Group Work vs Disadvantages of Group Work,//,"The lecturer argues that group work has a lot of disadvantages such as free rider, less-rewarding and low performances. These came out from one experiment which is taken by 6months to indicate the performance of group work. This directly contradicts the reading passage's claim that team project could offer several advantages by their collective intelligence.

To begin with, the lecturer says that more people take more time to make consensus. As many people participating with one group project, various opinions make a lot of troubles to coordinate people's idea into one specific provision. This casts doubt on the reading passage's claim that wide range of people can make a speedy decision making and creative solution.

Next, the lecturer provides one assumption that one or two influential people would handle whole project without gathering whole participants' ideas. As he said, influential person would decide or drop some object without considering others creative opinions. This counters the reading passage’s claim that participant who suggests good idea will be easy to get reward.

Finally, the lecturer claims that group work is not risk free project, whole participant must take entire risk. Not like individual project, group project is commonly big so far its risk is more than individual thing. If project fails, every participant cannot be free from blame. This contradicts the reading passage's claim that group work can scatter their responsibilities into tiny one.",//,essay,::
"These days, decreasing birth rate is a serious crisis in Korea and other rich countries. The problem is expected to greatly damage the countries’ economies. What are the ways we can solve this matter? Use specific details to support your answer.",//,"Decreasing birth rate is similar as an arrow. It’s affecting our country so badly. Due to the decreasing number of newborn babies, a big portion of Korea’s citizens is aged 65 and older. This matter can damage our economy badly because the country should invest a lot of money on taking care of retired seniors. Also, since there aren’t enough babies being given birth, Korea cannot raise new workers of the future. Isn’t there any way we can escape from this situation?
 
 The first thing we can do to solve problems related to the low birth rate is to encourage mothers and fathers to give birth to more children. The biggest reason why parents aren’t having children is because of the amount of money they should spend to raise them. (education fees, money to buy their clothes, etc.) The money spent to raise a child is impossible to be calculated, and parents are concerned if they would face hardships in managing their budgets. In this situation, the government can support them in spending money for their kids. Currently, the government of the Republic of Korea is funding fees spent for a third child in a family. Our country needs to come up with more ideas like this one in order to attract mothers to help increase the birth rate.
 
 The second solution is to let citizens know more about the seriousness of the decreasing birth rate. A lot of parents in Korea aren’t aware of the reasons why low birth rate is such a serious crisis. They don’t know that when a big number of citizens become 65 and older, our nation’s economic growth can slow down because we cannot raise enough workers for companies, and the government needs to spend a big part of people’s taxes for healthcare and retirement life of seniors. In this situation, we can write more news articles and books about the birth rate issue. Then, people who read these would be able to learn how serious the problem is.
 
 Low birth rate is a serious problem in our nation these days, and we have to come up with solutions to it. We can encourage parents to have more children, and write books and show news broadcasts about the issue in order to let the public realize that it is a huge matter. Personally, I think one of the reasons why it is hard to increase the birth rate is because not every citizen of our country is participating in coming up with solutions. It wouldn’t be hard to solve the crisis if all of us help bring our birth rate back to normal. Come on! Think of an idea! There isn’t anything impossible!",//,essay,::
TV programs and movies are obliged to show that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. Do you agree or disagree?,//,"Some argue that TV programs or movies we watch should be free from any restriction society puts, giving total allowance to express director/artist’s view. However, in my opinion, TV programs should have some extent of obligation to include common moral value or decency to protect young viewers. Further, these video images affect our view on society both consciously and unconsciously.

TV program producers or movie director should consider moral value in their creation because it affects young viewers’ behavior. It is well-known fact that children have tendency to imitate adults’ behavior. It is also applicable truth when they watch TV programs or movies. Especially, many TV programs and movies star celebrities which young people idolize. If such video images contain morally vague concepts, it would affect the youth negatively due to their tendency to emulate role models. Furthermore, the young tends to be less concrete about their morality, not knowing what is good or bad, and have vulnerable mentality. In this case, exposing them to morally ambiguous images damage their morality severely.
 
On top of that, these morally ambiguous images, which bad people get rewarded and good people get punished for example, would not only affect the young but also provoke adults. Visual images have tremendous impact on people. To elaborate, when exposed to these images without knowing it, it would unconsciously have effect on people. One study revealed that a person who watched violent movies have higher tendency to display violent behavior than that who did not. Therefore, putting images such as good people getting punished instead of bad people would damage people’s faith that good deeds result in luck and reward. If such belief continued among people, it would bring serious moral hazard to the society as a whole.

In conclusion, creators of visual images on screen are obliged to contain morally accepted consequence in the story they produce to protect both the young and old. ",//,essay,::
A nation should require all of its students to study the same curriculum until they enter college,//,"The different viewpoint on how to educate students has been a lingering question for all nations. Some argue that setting a fixed curriculum covering various subjects for all the students is more effective than adopting different curriculum for each one. However, in my opinion, opposite is right because each student has their own unique talent which cannot be same with others, and teaching the same curriculum lacks room for creativity.

As mentioned above, teaching the same curriculum for every highschooler is ridicule due to their unique talent of each and everyone. Some students might have artistic potential and others might be math prodigy. These two types of students cannot be taught in the same way. That is, a person who has better potential in art field would be better educated with classes of extended and deeper understanding of drawing or design, and math genius would be much more suited with classes with numbers and calculations. In this way, they can pursuit what they want to achieve in the future more effectively and successfully.

Another equally important reason is that teaching the same material to all the students discards the chance of creativity. Set out curriculum means all the study material is fixed-prepared for the students to be acquired. Thus, all students have to do is to memorize what they are taught. The tests will be given to measure students’ understanding of limited coverage of that study only. Therefore, there is not much room for the learners to perform their intellectual mind.

To wrap it up, all the students studying the same curriculum in high school is ineffective educational structure. Rather, government entity relevant to the education system should come up with better way to stimulate creativity and new ideas among endeavors and expand the room for them to play during the learning process.",//,essay,::
"It is better for governments to spend their funds on the exploration of outer space than on earthly matters. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer. You’ll have thirty minutes to plan, write, and revise your essay.",//,"There is no doubt that our planet Earth is highly contaminated these days. Due to the increased amount of greenhouse gasses being released into the atmosphere, our world is suffering from global warming and destruction of the ozon. In order to avoid this situation, many scientists are thinking of ways to find a planet everyone can migrate to when it becomes impossible to live on Earth. This is one of the reasons why people are investing a huge amount of money on outer space exploration. However, it sounds more ideal to spend governments’ funds to deal with earthly matters, not space exploration.
 
 To begin with, it isn’t easy to find a planet we can move to in the future. As I have mentioned above, planet Earth is greatly polluted nowadays. It is expected that in a few decades or so, it would be impossible to breathe in fresh air and drink clean water on our planet. Since they are too worried to face the future, people are in search for planets we can move to. However, it is very difficult to find our ideal planet. Until now, scientists weren’t able to find an appropriate planet for humans. Nearly every planet they discovered lacked water and air. Also, even though they have found an alternative home for people, it would take countless light years for us to get there. Instead of spending time and money on looking for a new planet, it would be easier to engage more in bringing our nature back to its original condition.
 
 Moreover, it is easier to find new resources on Earth than in outer space. Many people agree that one of the reasons why people are investing a lot of money on space exploration is because they want to find new materials there. Since we lack coals and other natural resources, a lot of countries think that they would be able to find alternative energies easily off Earth. However, I disagree with this. Even though we discover planets with rich minerals and energies, it still takes a lot of time and costs a lot for us to go there and bring those resources to Earth. It is better to think of more ways we can use nature (sunbeam, wind, water, etc.) to create new types of energy because it is much faster than space exploration.
 
  It is more ideal for governments to spend their funds on problems related to Earth, not ones about outer space. This is because it isn’t easy to find a planet to migrate to, and it is easier and faster to discover new energies on our planet than in space. I don’t mean that we shouldn’t have any curiosities about other planets and stars. I mean that we should care more about our planet Earth, which is suffering from global warming and other natural crisis. If we do so, we wouldn’t have to abandon the planet and move somewhere else.",//,essay,::
Universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries.,//,"Some people think that universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries. As far as I am concerned, I am in complete agreement with the argument. The two ideas stated below can be sufficient evidence to support my agreement.

To begin with, students have to take physical activities, such as basketball, football and tennis. This is because these sports can be revitalizing, offering an effective outlet for releasing stress and tension. As society becomes more complex and faster changing, students are increasingly tied up by heavy workloads including lectures, assignments and group studies. The result is frustration, as we feel pressure to handle tons of work. Because taking exercise is a refreshing activity, however, it can help students relieve their tension and stress. In this context, spending time on sports is a great way to relax. For example, when I was in college, I discussed same topic with my professor and friends, and they agreed that working out at the gym for a while and trying to relax are very good way to make balance between work and life. Even if it is only for a brief moment, they also mentioned that we can feel deeply composed and successfully gain some distance from out stress ridden daily routine. With these advices, I started to take jogging and hiking regularly, and I have felt energized and ready for another day of struggle with hustle and bustle of life. This is the reason why I strongly recommend for universities to invest more budgets on sports.

On top of that, doing sports for relaxation is useful in that it encourages people to have stronger ties with others around them. In todays' competitive society, we are under great pressure to outpace others, and thus lack time to be with our friends. As a result, we are less emotionally attached to our colleagues than we were in the past. By doing physical activities together and sharing our fun, however, we can sustain solid relationship with other people as well as friends. Therefore, the value of physical activities for relaxation should not be overlooked. This the real value of sports that libraries cannot provide for students. According to a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly 80% of students replied that they could restore their bonds with colleagues through sports. This survey also shows that these 80% could exchange ideas and develop sympathetic bonds while doing exercise together. This increases emotional attachment and, by extension, social awareness.

To sum up, because of the reasons mentioned above, I firmly believed that putting as much money on sports as on libraries by universities should not only be allowed, but encouraged. It allows us to release the stress caused by life in the campus and to improve our relationship with our friends.",//,essay,::
Television has destroyed communication among friends and family.,//,"It has been decades since television was distributed every single household, but its power over people became stronger than ever. Then why do people love TV so much? Some say endless entertainment attract people and others say easy access to education and information which was dominated by selected ones for centuries were the key fact to be loved so much. Nevertheless, I think disadvantages of TV overpower its favorable function especially lack of communication among friends and family.
 
First of all, TV attracts every attention toward its programs, so it can interrupt communication while watching them. There might be someone who resists admitting and saying they can perform activities perfectly while watching TV such as having meals and speaking on the phone. But they would finally admit the quality of doing will go down. They don’t taste of food much and don’t know how much they eat. And also they might experience either their conversation on the phone end up or they mute the TV to remove possible interruption. So does conversation with friends and family. People can talk over and over while watching TV, but usually topics of conversation might end up all TV-related. Fortunately non-TV related conversation has started it is hard to get it off one’s chest while watching it.
 
Last but not least, TV kills time without meaning, so precious time with people who you love is wasted. In modern society, people are extremely busy and they have limited span of time to be with their family or friends. But we generously allow our time to watch TV. What a waste?  I have experienced the same. I flipped through the channel with the remote and spent meaning less time with my family and finally went to bed without talking much. Only conversation I remember was: “Is there any other program? Why don’t we turn on the channel X?” So I lost my precious time watching idiot box instead of sharing my opinions and emotions with them.
 
In conclusion, TV destroys communication among people you love as well as relationship with them. We should understand the value of communication with them and make the most of it instead of killing time to watch TV. To do so, we need to use TV smartly. We can make rules to set time limits and choose programs in advance to avoid inevitable watching especially for children who are heaviest viewers among family.",//,essay,::
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Grades (marks) encourage students to learn. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,//,"There are many students who have been studying to get a high grades from their classes. We are able to find that whether it is true or not in library on midterm or final test period. Grades not only make students study hard but also can show them their current academic abilities. There are many reasons to support that sentence.

To begin with explanation that students study for grades, from my experience, when I was in high school, my school had a lot of tests which estimate student's abilities about how the students are understanding from each classes. I wasn't such a model student but I have needed to study because my overall GPA wasn't able to be qualified to apply for the college that I wanted to attend. So I have studied so hard to earn achievement like getting better grades. The more I've spent time on learning eagerly, The higher score that I could get was there written on my grading paper. I was getting encouraged about learning. Finally, I got an score qualified for applying to the college.

The second reason is that Grades can show us our current abilities about how are we understanding about what we are learning. To take a personal example, when I was learning about calculus that I have been going through harsh time, I couldn't even know such as which part of questions I am weak and Is it right way to solve this kind of problem ?.After that, I have decided to take a self test to check my circumstance about what I am studying. I asked my math teacher to give some of questions that I have studied and I have taken that test for estimating my abilities. Consequently, I could find what kind of problems are hard for me to solve by myself and I have spent more time on them. Finally, I could overcome those problems and I got high score I saw for myself that Grades can show me current skills and give me what to do.

In conclusion, Although we do not study for score itself, we are able to receive exact and a lot of pertinent feedbacks which give the way how to study for weak part of what we are learning and time allocation from grade",//,essay,::
" Because the world is changing so quickly, people now are less happy or less satisfied with their lives than people were in the past.  ",//,"I agree with the statement that people now are less happy or less satisfied with their lives than people were in the past. Actually, compared to the past few decades, people are living in the best comfortable world. People who live in modern society can buy anything and live great life than past world. However, we are no longer happy and not satisfied with our lives. People are unhappy.

First of all, because we have to compete with people around us, we are so tired and depressed. For fast development, competition is very effective method especially to the company. In capitalization society, people should compete with their coworkers, other company and other countries. It is also realized in the school. For example, when I was a high school student, there were a great deal of competition among students to go to the good university. At that moment, I competed one of my classmate and she really hated me because I got better score than hers. One day, she stole my books that contained a lot of important things about the exam. Thanks to the CCTV, I could get it back. However, I felt so bad about her and this social system. This competition makes a innocent high school student criminal. Therefore, I think too much competition make this world really stressful and depressed.

 Secondly, the weakness of family bond makes people really unhappy. People are social animals and they live with their lovely family. The familiarity of family members plays very important role in our happy lives. However, in this fast changing society, family is breaking rapidly. According to the research of the Seoul University, the divorce rate increased fifty percent compared to the last 1990s. This research shows us that so many couples broke up and so did the family. In the past, only few couples got divorced easily. Increasing divorce rate also means that many children are living in one parent family. In this environment, children can not grow well. This family bankrupting is very important reason why we are unhappy.

In conclusion, we who live in fast changing society are not happy compared to the people who live in the past. Not only competing society, but also family destruction is very important reason

The best way to learn about foreign country is by reading newspapers and magazines. ,//,"Some people might say that books could provide more information about foreign countries than any other sources, and other would say that watching movies or soap operas is the easiest way to understand the countries. However, as far as I'm concerned, reading newspapers and magazines would be a best way to know about other countries for two reasons: to convey up-to-date information and to be easy and efficient way to know other countries.
 
First of all, newspapers and magazines give new information quickly. Of course, learning the history of the foreign countries would be a good way to understand rooted emotion of the nation, but our fundamental purpose is to win in the competitions with them or to work with them. At this time, what is more important is knowing the situation at present,not their history. To be a book is published, a significant time is consumed; on the other hand, newspapers or magazines allow us to know affairs which happened yesterday or even today. According to a survey conducted by the management department of California university in 2009, the 75 percent of the people working in the field of trade were subscribing more than 2 kinds of news papers or magazines from their partners' or competitors' countries. They said that from that kind of media, they can grasp the countries' market situation and overall atmosphere at present. They also said that the resouces have the most important role in making strategies to working with them. In this sense, using newspapers and magazines is a great way to know foreign countries. 
 
Also, getting information from newspapers and magazines is an easier and efficient way compared to other ways. Some people say that watching some movies or soap operas would be easier since the characters starring in them use easy words. However, sometimes watchers of other countries only feel significant cultural gap, and do not understand the characters' feelings at all. Not only that we can not gain enough information when considering the time we spent waching them. Other people would say that having penpal friends who live in abroad, but this way also has a serious problem because we tend to get knowledge which is skewed by our friends' worldviews. This will disturb to understand the foreign country objectively. In the case of books, we would feel difficulty although they might provide us a lot of information, since the context is used to contain the knowledge which can be exactly understood only when we have background knowledge. Compared to that, when we try to use newspapers and magazines, we can get understandable as well as significant amount of information in a comparatively short time.
 
In short, although there are various information sources, in that newspapers and magazines convey new information faster and easier, as well as effectively since they are written in order to be read by most common people, and they are published in a short time.  ",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of the internet, students can learn more effectively.",//,"In this recent society, many people adamantly believe that students can take advantage of the internet when they want to learn something. However, there exist many side effects of the internet that actually hamper effective learning. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that students can learn from on-line.

First and foremost, the internet provides too much information. This means that it contains invalid and incorrect information which could mislead students. When students are faced with invalid information, it is highly like that they cannot distinguish it from other reliable information but just accept it. For example, when I was high school student, I relied on the internet to finish my literature homework. I decided to log in one literature forum and ask some question related to Korean poetry in 20th century. I believed that people in the literature forum knows about questions that I asked. However, I realized that answers from the internet were absurd in some parts. Now, I can see that not every person in that forum was good at literature. I believe that their fragmented information hampered my learning at that time. As seen from this compelling example, students can gather unconvincing information from the internet and that information could disrupt effective learning.

Secondly, students could not be inculcated with the way to think by themselves because the internet provides answers within a few seconds without providing room for thinking. In other words, students could not rear the ability of abstract thinking and inference which is essential for the effective learning. This idea was reflected on the recent study conducted by 100 teenage students. A group of students who do not use the internet for their study got high scores in an inference ability test whereas the other group of students who use the internet got relatively low scores. Therefore, the internet could not help the real learning because it cannot offer chances of making one’s own thought.

In conclusion, using the internet is not helpful for student’s learning. It not only provides low quality information and misleads students but also takes away chances of having logical thinking. ",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of the internet, students can learn more effectively.",//,"Some argue that Internet is unreliable source of information so that it is not a good resource for learning. However, I believe opposite is the case due to tremendous amount of information that Internet contains and quick and easy access that it allows.
 
First of all, Internet allows students to access pool of information around the world. Therefore, endeavors can learn more on the material as they want. If students want to learn more on the subject, they can search further on the matter and can have deeper understanding on the subject. From my personal experience, for example, when I had to do a research on history of Australia during my college year, Internet offered me more information than books in library. To illustrate, books provided limited information on the matters I was looking for, so I had to go over many books at the same time to gather complete set of research. It was both time-consuming and ineffective. On contrary, Internet had useful information more than enough to put in my research paper, but also sufficed my personal interest on the matter.
 
On top of that, Internet is quick and easy method to search for information, making it very effective tool to learn. Students can access information they are looking for through simple typing and clicking using computer at home. To elaborate, search engines such as Google and Yahoo offer endless list of webpages in a second on the subject typed in. Students can go on to the link and read the articles or research papers related to their research. Moreover, information is accessible anywhere around the world as long as there is online connection. This quick and easy availability of information makes Internet powerful tool to educate endeavors.

The scientific technology has made people happier than before. ,//,"Some people say that technology has brought about many side effects like environmental problems and depletion of resources. However, I believe that such adverse effects are overwhelmed by its benefits which science technology has gave us like that it allows us not to do repetitive or dangerous work by making machines done it instead; to communicate each other easier.
 
 First of all, technology has made us safer and not bored by using machines in risky or tedious tasks. In that when people do dangerous tasks, they are likely to hurt or lost their lives; when they do boring work, they tend to be lethargic, technologies have strongly helped people to become happier. For example, in the past, when people needed to make tunnels, workers had to do perilous tasks including breaking stones with tools in person and conveying them. Through the processes, many people got hurt and dead because of unfortunate accidents. According to the record which is calculated by the Ministry of Labor of Korea, in 1950s, the number of workers who dead in tunnel construction sites was about 3,500. Compared to that, at present, there are much fewer people lost their lives while doing construction work. This is absolutely because construction technologies have advanced. In other words, technology saved lives of a lot of people. In that anyone's life is directly concerned with other's happiness, science technologies have improved our lives.
 
  Also, science technology let us communicate each other much better. The Internet and cell phone have been widely spread throughout the world. Since such devices allow us to communicate each other very easily and fast, even though we live far apart each other, we can make conversation as frequently as they live near our houses. According to a survey conducted by sociology department of Texas University, people are making contact with their family or friends about 70 percent more, compared to 40years ago. This increase has occurred more sharply when the Internet appeared, and until now, the rise has continued. In that the fact proven by various psychology experiments that true happiness comes from interaction with other people, no doubt, technology has contributed to happiness of people.
 
In short, by employing science technologies, people come to be significantly free from risky tasks, as we can see the decreased number of deaths of construction workers. Moreover, development of telecommunication has allowed us to make conversation easily which will also help us to make deep relationships. For these reasons, I strongly believe that technologies have made our lives blissful.   ",//,essay,::
A person's childhood years (the time from birth to twelve years of age) are the most important years of a person's life. ,//,"Confucius, the greatest philosopher of ancient China said, ""Childhood is the most important time of your life."" This points out the significance of youth in one's life, Having said this, childhood years especially from birth to twelve years of age are important because it is the time when one's personality is shaped up and one absorbs knowledge faster than any other time in life.

To begin with, childhood holds significance due to its impact on forming a child's personality. When a child is born, psychologists claim that his or her mind is like a ""blank slate"" meaning that a child's personality is not yet determined at birth. Thus a child develops own temperament as he grows up. Therefore, what a child sees, hears, and feels in childhood all add up to become one's personality. Consequently, a child's youth is important because it is the time when a child's personality is determined.

Secondly, children absorb knowledge faster than any other time in their life. Thus children should constantly be exposed to new information during childhood years. The capability of children to learn about new knowledge cannot be compared to that of adults'. For instance, when a child is sent to another country, he picks up the language very fast and naturally assimilate into the new culture. On the other side, adults are slower at learning a new language and a culture. Scientists explain that a child's brain is like a sponge as it absorbs new information very fast. Thus it is the reason scientists emphasize on the importance of education at an early age. All in all, youth is significant because it is when children learn new things very fast.

In conclusion, childhood years are influential to children's lives because their personalities are shaped up at that time and they pick up new knowledge faster than any other time in their lives.     ",//,essay,::

First and foremost important fact here is that there are more times to be emphasized than childhood years during the lifetime. Adolescent years for example, are one of these crucial times growing into adult mentally and physically. Moreover, college years are another particular years since it offers many chances to meet new people and travel around the world. In the same vein, how about retiring periods or career-pursuing –after college years? In this regard, it is obvious that childhood years are not the only times that are important in life.
 
On the top of that, most of the experiences that people go through during the childhood years are limited. Children do not undergo so many things as adults do. They go to school in the morning, and come back home afternoon. They might enjoy some extracurricular activities or hang out with friends, but those activities are not to be compared with the things adults do. To elaborate, adults can go travel around the world and experience new culture. They fall in love with another and build new relationships. Pursuing their own career or dream is also one of these experiences that only adults go through. Therefore, it is undeniable that only little taste of life is allowed during the childhood. Thus, childhood being the most important time of life is overstatement.
 
In conclusion, childhood years are not the most important years of a person’s life because there exists more crucial years ahead, and childhood experiences are narrow and limited compared to other times in life. In this manner, I disagree with the statement.",//,essay,::
It is more important to give students awards for their effort rather than give awards for achievement.,//,"All people try their best to obtain their aim, but most of them fail to get the success even though they work really diligently. Furthermore, some people acquire unintended result though they do not work hard. It is quite unfair for those who study rally hard. Therefore, we should recognize the effort of journey of people. In that way, we could hearten people to try their goal again, and be more helpful in the future. Lastly, realizing only success is malicious way of assessing person's nature.
 
If we encourage people who fail to obtain their achievements, it would give them a tremendous effect. For instance, he could get the willing to try again and overcome this complicated situation whenever he faces it. In contrast, we did not try to recognize the effort of failed person, it would trigger detrimental consequences. In Korea, most of high school students have gotten innumerable pressures from their studying. They work really hard to go to famous university. However, this reason sometime bring bad situation like committing suicides. The most adequate reason to explain their suicide is their parent. Their parent only seeks the better grade then the student gets and seeks the good result. This greed of student's parent led their children to die. If they just hearten their children to try again. Their child does not need to commit this perilous behavior and successfully achieves their goals.
 
Most of people get the energy or motivation through people they love or respect. This willing is really tremendous, so it makes people to not relinquish again when they conflict the situation they struggle with. If not, they could be obsessed with success and finally undermine the situation. Therefore, we should realize the effort of one’s. The person with successfully overcome the intricate situation is more likely to success, because they know how to deal with problem they encountered before. In other words, they endure their problem by other’s encouragement.
 
Evaluating people with their fortune and property is vicious way to assess people. All people have totally different characteristic and way of thinking, so we should carefully judge people. There is some old fairy story that perfectly matches with this idea. Long time ago, there is a very rich old man. He does not know how to socialize with other, because he spends his whole life to make money. After the rich man retires from his work, he decides to make friends. As time goes by, the rich man successfully makes two friends. His first friend uses to avoid pay money, while his second friend is willing to pay the money during playing time. One day, the rich man loses his all money to defrauder. He does not have any place to sleep. Therefore, we go to his first friend’s house, but he refuses the rich man to sleep at his house when he hears the story. The old man gets shocked and he finally realizes that he was wrong. At that moment, the second friend finds the old man is sitting on the street. He brings the old man without asking why and let him to live in his house until he catches the defrauder. Throughout this happening, the old man recognized how to assess the people.
 
Most people work really hard and some of them succeed in obtaining their goal, while the others fails to achieve their aim. When one of our surrounded people faces this happening, we should hearten them to try again instead of compelling them to try again.",//,essay,::
Universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries.,//,"Some people think that universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries. As far as I am concerned, I am in complete agreement with the argument. The two ideas stated below can be sufficient evidence to support my agreement.

To begin with, students have to take physical activities, such as basketball, football and tennis. This is because these sports can be revitalizing, offering an effective outlet for releasing stress and tension. As society becomes more complex and faster changing, students are increasingly tied up by heavy workloads including lectures, assignments and group studies. The result is frustration, as we feel pressure to handle tons of work. Because taking exercise is a refreshing activity, however, it can help students relieve their tension and stress. In this context, spending time on sports is a great way to relax. For example, when I was in college, I discussed the same topic with my professor and friends, and they agreed that working out at the gym for a while and trying to relax are very good way to make balance between work and life. Even if it is only for a brief moment, they also mentioned that we can feel deeply composed and successfully gain some distance from out stress ridden daily routine. With these advices, I started to take jogging and hiking regularly, and I have felt energized and ready for another day of struggle with hustle and bustle of life. This is the reason why I strongly recommend for universities to invest more budgets on sports.

On top of that, doing sports for relaxation is useful in that as it encourages people to have stronger ties with others around them. In todays' competitive society, we are under great pressure to outpace others, and thus lack time to be with our friends. As a result, we are less emotionally attached to our colleagues than we were in the past. By doing physical activities together and sharing our fun, however, we can sustain solid relationship with other people as well as friends. Therefore, the value of physical activities for relaxation should not be overlooked. This is the real value of sports that libraries cannot provide for students. According to a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly 80% of students replied that they could restore their bonds with colleagues through sports. This survey also shows that these 80% could exchange ideas and develop sympathetic bonds while doing exercise together. This increases emotional attachment and, by extension, social awareness.

To sum up, because of the reasons mentioned above, I firmly believed that putting as much money on sports as on libraries by universities should not only be allowed, but encouraged. It allows us to release the stress caused by life in the campus and to improve our relationship with our friends.",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with that the opinions of celebrities, such as entertainers and athletes, are more important to younger people than they are to the older people.",//,"In current days, lots of celebrities give own opinions about diverse topics including politics, environments, or health care. It is controversial that for which ages, between young people and older people, celebrities' opinions are important. I believe that the opinions of celebrities would be more important to youngsters. It would be more influential and persuasive than opinions from others for them.

To begin with, the opinions of celebrities are influential, especially for young people. For these days, many celebrities try to communicate with their fans by using SNS(Social Network Service; for example, Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter). The major user of this service is young people. In addition, the characteristic of young users is fast forwarding, sharing speed. Thus, what celebrities say spreads fast. According to the result conducted by Korean National University, only one hour is required to spread some news into all 20’s in the world. On the other hand, three days are needed to spread same news into all 40’s in the world. In other words, lots of young people can be assimilated with what celebrities say.

Furthermore, the opinions of celebrities are persuasive. Generally, the more people are young, the more likely to imagine of what they want to be. Hence, lots of youngsters follow celebrity trends. They even try to share emotions or feelings of celebrities. This is why young people are easily moved from what celebrities say. For example, until a Korean famous singer insists that pets be well-treated more than current condition, most people except who loves pets were indifferent about animal cruelties. After the singer’s opinion, lots of young people including their family members, relatives participated in the signature-collecting campaign for protecting abused pets.

A strong word can change public opinion. Celebrities’ opinions can be a strong word because their saying is influential and convincing. Remember, the opinions’ power of influence and persuasiveness are being originated from young people. Taking all above things into account, celebrities’ opinions are more important to young people than old people.",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
A person who drives his or her own car during rush hour in a crowded city should be charged a fee.",//,"Some people argue that driving private automobiles during rush hour is selfish conduct, so that it should be restricted with extra charges. However, in my opinion, such resolution not only perturbs personal freedom to own and drive cars, but also ineffective solution to the traffic congestion.
 
The first and foremost reason why people should not be charged with driving their own private mobile during rush hour is because it is against the basic principle that personal freedom should be protected. It is citizen’s freedom and their own will to buy cars and drive them. In addition, it is wholly their choice of freedom to drive anytime anywhere. Such basic rights of freedom should be protected under any circumstances. No society or authority has given rights to interfere such choice. Charging fees on driving their private cars is one of these acts that go against the principle. Therefore, the charge should not be put on any given situation.
 
On top of that, charging on driving their private mobiles is not a good way to solve deeper problem which is traffic congestion. I believe that the idea comes from the chronicle trouble that every city goes through which is traffic congestion. Making drivers to pay extra charges is only a temporary solution to this problem. That is, some people will still want to drive their mobiles even though they have to pay few extra charges because it is just more convenient, leaving the problem unsolved. Therefore, better solution should be implemented such as installing more traffic roads or improving public transportation system. In this regard, charging fees on drivers is short-sighted decision. It is obvious that there is a better way.
 
In conclusion, people’s freedom of rights to drive anytime anywhere should not be perturbed by charging fees and there exists better ways to solve the deeper issue that is traffic congestion. For these reasons, I disagree with the statement.",//,essay,::
Television advertising directed toward children under the age of five should not be allowed.,//,"There has been an argument regarding the issue that television advertising targeted to children under the age of five should not be allowed. There are myriads of people who insist that advertisement for children under five years old should be allowed because it is the basic right of commercial company. On the other hand, from my perspective, Television advertising for the children under the age of five should not be allowed because of the reasons below. 

First of all, television advertising badly affect to children's mind whose age's are under five. Children under 5 years old have no sense of rational judgement and and also vulnerable to stimulation. Commonly, television advertisements whose target are especially children under 5 years old, tend to be extremely stimulating and it might devastate children's plain spirit. For example, my cousin whose age is 4 had exposed to a lot of violent television advertisement. Some advertisement showed him that the hero killed the enemy by using the sword that they want to sell. Consequently, my cousin struck his younger brother by using wood stick and he screamed the name of the toy sword's name. He did not think this behavior was bad because he saw the similar scene at the television advertisement. 

Secondly. television advertising cause unnecessary consumption. The advertisement aimed for the children skillfully stimulate children's will of possession. The children who obsessed with those advertisement's fancy lure, has no choice buy continuously requests their parents to buy those products. This cause unnecessary buying of products no matter it is necessary or not. According to the research conducted by Korea University, advertisements for the children are the most effective promotion method of companies. It is because those generation is easily captivated, effectively create the profits. Only thing the greedy companies' concern is to lead the young children cry for their parents to buy products. 

To sum up, television advertising badly affect the children's pure mind, and it cause unnecessary consumption. Hence, I strongly emphasize that television advertising directed toward children under the age of five should not be allowed.",//,essay,::
The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.,//,"Someone says that group tour is quite convenient and useful. However, in my opinion, a group tour has more disadvantages than advantages. To be specific, group tour might reduce the opportunities for both flexible schedules and in-depth-studies for tourists.
 
To begin with, I hope to clarify the definition of the travel. It is the opportunity to see extraordinary environments and cultural monuments with relaxed mind. In other words, the first purpose of travel for tourists is relaxing. When it comes to think a group tour, however, you can easily imagine the time tables and schedules for accommodations, museums, transportation and meals, which were already fixed before departure by tour guide. Just last summer, my family traveled China by using group tour service. It was horrible for my family; the schedule was too tight to relax. Even my younger brother had a severe diarrhea at that time, we could not relax at the hotel because of the reserved transportation to go the other city. This shows the direct disadvantages of group tour. Of course, group tour is cheaper than individual tour. If you consider the first principle of traveling, you are better to travel by individuals.
 
In addition, as I mentioned in previous paragraph, during traveling, we would like to see exotic things such as architectural forms, cultural heritages, and traditional rituals. As we well know, group tour cannot provide various options to see those things; they only provide limited routes for glancing some popular things, without consideration of tourists' interests. Even if the group tour company gives a chance to see some specific monument, the tourists have only small amount of time to glance it. One might say that this type of traveling is a ""get, glance and go"". Unlike group tour program, individual tour makes more flexible time to enjoy the exotic features. You can enjoy your time at your favorable space; you can grab a chance to watch MLB at the stadium, without watching some boring national history museum.
 
As I have stated, the group tour has a more disadvantage than advantage because of the inflexible and pre-planned schedules. This is why I strongly believe that individual tour is better to relax and enjoy the traveling for tourists than group tour.

 Hard work has more to do with success than luck does.,//," As the world continues to undergo economic recess, the number of people who want to make a lot of money easily and fast by luck. They argue that there is nothing much better than success with their luck because they do not have to go through difficult hardships. However, I strongly believe that people can have a more successful life not by their chances but by their hardwork since success based on hard work lasts for a long time and is much more satisfying.

First of all, if people work hard to achieve their dreams and goals, they are more likely to be successful for life. This is because while people do their best at their work and in their study, they not only gain great rewards but also  valuable assets such as diligence and time management skilles which would help them persistently. On the contrary, the successful result obtained from just luck is temporary. For instance, when I took a math test at middle school, I got good grades even though I guessed many answers because I was not prepared much. It was just a luck but it made me lazy studying, which led to poor grades on the next step. I realized that I should not depend on my luck and therefore, I stuied very hard by planning ahead and practicing a lot of mock exams. In doing so, I learned study skills and hard working spirit as well as gained much better grades on exams.

Second, if people succeed due to their efforts, they are more likely to treasure their success. That is, people who performed their best are happy and satisfied with what they earned while those who readily got what they want without any hard work do not value about it since they did not earn it by doing on their own. According to a recent study, most of the lottery winners are having a miserable life, even worse than before they did not win the lottery. They are having family ploblems, huge debt and mental diseases. This is due to the fact that they became bored with ordinary things and tend to look for only better luck, not thinking about working hard. As a result, they lose true happiness with their lives and their seemingly success was disappeared fast as it came fast.",//,essay,::
It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Please included specific reasons and details to support your answer.,//,"Some people think that it is better for child to grow up in a big city, not grow up in the countryside. However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside because children can think more and children cannot control their parents.

First of all, it is advantageous for children to grow up in the countryside rather than in a big city because children who live in countryside relatively do not affected by their parents, so they can think deeply. To illustrate my point, there was a boy who lives in rural area. He always gets along with animals such as sheep and cow. Later, he had broadened mind and better thinking. This is because by living animals, he always spent time for himself such as wrote daily schedule and practice instruments. Those can be cheer for him and bring about his personality largely. Due to these facts, there are no doubts that it is advantageous for children to grow up in the countryside.

Furthermore, it is undeniable that it is better for kids to grow up in the countryside than in a big city because children who live in near the capital always repeat same schedule, so those works cannot develop children’s mind. In a recent research conducted by the Education Department of South Korea, it stated that 78.9% of elementary school students who live in Seoul were very busy daily lives. This is because their parents have proud with their kids, so many parents dominate their children such as teach varieties of education system. This is not an isolated incident, similar researches were conducted in many other Asian countries such as Japan and Taiwan and the results were for the same reasons. In this sense, it is undeniable that it is better for kids to grow up in the countryside than in a big city.

Talking all of these into consideration, I strongly believe that it is beneficial for youngsters to grow up in the rural area rather than in a big city for the reasons I mentioned above.",//,essay,::
Government should pay attention to health care /not environmental problem,//,"Many people argue that government should pay more attention to health care because keeping people healthy is more important than maintaining clean environment. Nonetheless, I strongly suggest that government put environmental problems before health care because reduced environmental problems can mean less health care burden for government and a large portion of environmental problems cannot be treated individually whereas people can individually care for their own health.

First of all, if government pay more attention to environmental concerns, health problems will naturally decrease. Environmental pollution is one of the leading factors of disease nowadays. Therefore, if government increase its investment in environmental protection and enforce stricter laws, it can consequently cut its budget for health care. For instance, if someone suffers lung cancer which is usually known to be caused by air pollution, this person will probably rely on government subsidies to receive expensive treatments. If government had paid more attention to regulate environmental pollution in the first place, government would not have had to spend a dime on this person. Consequently, government should pay more attention to environmental concerns as a long term solution to health problems.     

Secondly, environmental issues cannot usually be handled individually while each person can look after own health. Environmental problems are global concerns which require the initiatives of government. For example, the deforestation in Amazon is causing severe global scale problems such global warming. However, there is a limit to what individuals can do to stop these without the help of  government. On the other side, health problems can be dealt individually by regularly exercising and maintaining healthy diet. There is nothing much government can do except for financially subsidizing patients. Having said all, government should prioritize environmental problems. 

In conclusion, government should take environmental issues more seriously than health care because reducing environmental problems can be a solution to health problems and health care can be done individually.  ",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
The extended family is less important now than in the past",//,"Some argue that the extended family is not as important as it used to be because people’s lifestyle has changed according to development of urban city, which small-sized family is more adaptable. However, in my opinion, there should be more emphasis on the big family in contemporary society. That is, children can improve their social skills from the youth in the extended family and people feel much happier and have more of sense of security.
 
To begin with, the extended family provides much better environment for children to develop their social skills. That is, from the very early age, children get to build relationships with different types of people including grandparents, uncles, aunties, and nephews. Such family members are belong to different age groups and each relationship is different and unique from each other. Therefore, children naturally learn how to communicate with the younger, older, male, or female, developing communication skills dealing with various types of people which they will encounter in the society. Such skills are essential part of life for children to live harmoniously. For example, my friend Min-young was born in the extended family which includes many family members. Her personality is always outgoing, very sociable and popular among friends. I believe such character of her comes from her background having extended family.
 
On top of that, people who grew up in extended family tend to be much happier and feel sense of security more than those people who grew up in the nuclear family. To elaborate, people who belong to the big family have surroundings which they can always get support from. If one is in difficult situation and experiencing hard times in life, he or she can discuss with family members. Since there are many family members who went through many things in life, one can get useful advices from them and overcome difficulties easily. Moreover, family members will not only support physically but also mentally. They will provide emotional support and assistance which would lead to sense of security and comfort. Such comfort is very important living in the stressful contemporary society. Therefore, it is understatement that extended family is less important now than in the past. It is as equally important now as it was in the past.
 
To wrap up, it is obvious that extended family is as crucial as in the past now because it offers better environment for children to improve social skills, and it provides sense of security and comfort to people. In this regard, I completely agree with the statement.",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with that the opinions of celebrities, such as entertainers and athletes, are more important to younger people than they are to the older people.",//,"These days people can easily express and share their opinions about certain subjects via SNS such as Twitter and Facebook. Obviously, entertainers were one of those who actively put their opinions regarding controversial issues, and I believe that those famous people played a pretty important role in making the younger generations than older ones get interest in these issues.

First of all, younger people pay attention to and care about the opinions and thoughts of celebrities than older generations. This can be seen among the teenagers most of the times, since teens tend to have a longing for certain celebrity they favor and idolize them; hence, feel curiosity towards the thoughts and perspectives he or she has and easily are influenced by these thoughts. For example, an entertainer brought up an issue about animal abuse, and left a sentence saying animals should be treated well since they are also living creatures that have feelings on her own homepage, with a photo she took with her pet dog together. This was noticed by many people who agreed with her view and took part in spreading it to more people, and most of them were teenagers and young people in their 20's, who cared about this celebrity much.

In addition, younger generations are more familiar to using electronic devices and sharing ideas through them, which older people usually are not very interested in. With the drastic development of Informational Technology, younger people were born and grew up with electronic gadgets as more options were attached to them year by year, and ostensibly many celebrities who dominantly use SNS based on the Internet as a way to express their ideas are the young ones who consist this generation. As a result, younger people would look into celebrities' opinions more and be much more exposed to opinions of celebrities than older ones who hardly get a chance to do this; and eventually, younger ones who frequently watched famous people's views would be affected at least to some extent.

To sum up, with the drastic improvement in technology combined with usual attention of younger generations towards their objects of observation, famous, unreachable and respected people, it made the celebrities' perspectives very influential to younger people. This point seems obvious, if it has acted rather as a negative or positive way to us.",//,essay,::
People who do not accept criticism from others cannot be successful at working in a group.,//,"There has been heated debate over the issue of whether people who do not accept criticism from others cannot be successful at working in a group. While there are many good arguments for both positions, the following argument will explain in detail why I agree.

  My first argument for the influence of people should be espoused. This is because people play critical roles in developing our untapped talents. Modern-day people live hectic lives because today's globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. Consequently, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the fields of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for people to help us to develop our talents and tap into our full potential. Therefore, people' influence cannot be overlooked in this context. According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people who are under the close guidance of their co-workers and boss at their workplace decide on their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not. The majority of education experts argued that people are likely to be unproductive if they do not fully receive the advice and help of their peers and boss, especially when they are in their potential stages.
 
  Moreover, my strong support for people' influence can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that people, with their years of experience, can offer lessons on morality and ethics. People who are not still mentally immature have long way to go before they become experts in their fields. During this long journey, they tend to make many mistakes and are prone to misbehave. However, people can be guided by their closer friends and mates, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms and can thus become good models for society. In this respect, people exert good influence on us. For example, undeveloped people may give in to the temptation of playing computer games all nights long because they are too immature to judge right from wrong. This is why people' influence is an urgent need. With the guidance of them, such as co-workers or boss of us, we can learn how to avoid such temptations and become law-abiding citizens, by listening our advisers' descriptions of their own experiences. Through such lessons, we can become holistic beings.

  In a nut shell, my discussion above presents two stronger arguments for people' influence which I believe effectively convince the reader.",//,essay,::
Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destrotying a friendship,//,"Some people believe that allowing a friend making a mistake is better idea than trying to prevent him or her from it. This is because they think another person's advice may not always work out sometimes. However, I firmly believe that even though it would be risky that destroy a relationship, people should take action for their friends for following reasons: First, one can't make wise decision alone and second, it will worsen a friendship if something gets wrong with a friend.

To begin with, every human being is not perfect creature. Which means we always can't make smart decision by ourselves in all situations. That is why a good friend exists. People should help their friends to do right thing when others seem to walk along the wrong path. For example, I have an old friend named Jihee. Since Jihee has always felt that she needs to study more, she decided to study abroad in United States after she graduated college. After getting in graduate school in California, everything seemed going well with her. However, one day I realized via her friend that she got addicted to alcohol because she could not get used to new life in strange country and had heavy pressure under the a lot of tests she had to pass. As one of closest friend, I was worrying about her situation. So I flew to her place and persuaded her to take off the school for a year and come back to hometown. At first, she refused to take my advice, but she soon went back to Korea with me and got some therapies for her alcohol addiction. If I had not taken any action for her situation, she would be in serious trouble by now. Therefore, it is important to guide friends into right direction rather than sitting back and watch them making wrong decisions.

On top of that, just letting a friend decide any choice can worsen relationship sometimes. If a friend's decision get wrong and something bad happens to her, she may blame on me having not told any advice to her. Thus it would break our friendship. For example, when I was in high school, I used to have a friend Nancy. At that time Nancy was considering breaking up with her boyfriend because he would not respond her messages and calls for two weeks. Even though I saw that guy walking with a strange girl at the shopping mall, I didn't give her any advice because it could hurt her feelings. Also I thought all matters were up to Nancy. However, after she realized the boy was cheating on her, Nancy suddenly blamed on me that I haven't told anything I knew to her. After for a while, Nancy apologized to me about being dramatic, but we could not get along well as we used to. This example implies that sometimes letting a friend making own decisions is not good idea and may break a relationship.

To sum up, I agree with the idea that taking action that risks destroying a friendship Is better than letting a friend make a mistake. Since people usually can't make smart decision alone, friends need to guide that right direction. Also, sometimes sitting back and allowing a friend decide whatever they want will worsen a friendship if something gets wrong with her.",//,essay,::
"The extended family (grandparents, cousins, aunts, and uncles) is less important now than it was in the past.",//,"Some people might say that the extended family is important. They could say they can learn about a profound family culture as one of reasons. However, I believe that the extended family is less important now, compare to the past decades. This is because people generally do not live with their extended family. Also, people in these days are too busy.

 

To begin with, it is not common that living with their extended family, or living close to their extended family today. Around two decades ago, it was common that living with or living close to a lot of family members including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and so on. However, as time goes by, the size of family has been decreased, and the frequency of meeting extended family has been decreased, too. This situation naturally discourages people communicate with their extended family. In a nutshell, it will be no difference between extended family and strangers in near future. Considering current trend, I believe that the importance of extended family is just an illusion.

Secondly, nowadays, people live in a big competition. All the things related to their life belong to the matter of competitions. For example, teenagers compete their academic grades, a business man compete their companies. There is no enough time to looking how their family lives well or similar things. According to the research conducted by Korean University in 2010, eighty-percent of people talks with their extended family once a month. Furthermore, half of the people who are in the eighty-percent answered that they do not care about their extended family because of their tight life. This result shows the fact that people do not consider their extended family as cherish human beings in the world, contrast to the past tendency.

To sum up, family separation has brought less communication and indifference to the extended family. Struggle for hot competition in these days prevents people from paying attention to their family members, especially to the extended family members. Taking all these things into account, I think the extended family is less important now than before.",//,essay,::
"In today’s world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.",//,"Modern technological development has made our lives faster than ever before. Under this circumstance, people nowadays tend to live with the faster face, and people are now concern more about efficiency. As a result, doing things slowly and making almost everything correctly seems to be sort of out of date. In a modern society, people should, I believe, work at a higher speed and risk taking mistakes.

First of all, the development of modern technology has made our life faster than ever before. With the assistance of modern techniques, we consequently should work faster than ever before. For instance, in the old days people made their own clothes by hand. However, now machines in the factories have made sewing and weaving at a great speed and of great quality. We do not have waste any time doing cumbersome works because of the modern technology. Therefore, we should not insist to work at a slow pace instead of enjoying convenience that is brought by technology.

Another important aspect is, now we are living in a society which develops rapidly. To meet the rapid change and improvement, all of us need to improve our own efficiency. As we can see, almost every factory wants to increase its productivity and almost all the employers to generate greater value within the time limitation. Nobody wants to be a loser in the society, so the only way to keep pace with the whole society is to accelerate, which is, working faster. Admittedly, it is highly possible for us to make mistakes when working as a high speed. But in fact, we human beings make mistakes, so even if we work as slowly and carefully as possible, we still risk making errors. However, by taking the advantage of high self-efficiency, we can do our work more precisely than ever before.

All in all, in todaty’s world, people should work as a higher spped. It is so important that everyone in a modern society should be like that. It is a general tendency of the world.",//,essay,::
Should children learn about the notion of managing money? Do you agree or disagree?,//,"Some people might think that children do not have to learn about the notion of managing money because how to manage money can be educated by confronting the real situations in their future.

Most of this happening exists due to the wrong management. For example, people sometimes invest their money without profound consideration. Another case, someone lend their money to their friends without official documents. To prevent these situations, people should know how to manage their own money since they are young.
 
Moreover, people who manage their money well can enjoy their life with high quality. Even though pocket money cannot cover the expense of enjoying high quality life, such as travelling, learning, going concert, if money has been well managed, this life can come as reality. Let us suppose two persons. They get same amount of money from company once a month. One person saved one third of money, and spent remaining in buying necessary things. The other spent all the money for temporary amusements. One year after, the first person plan to world trip with saved money. The other also wants to go but he cannot do because he already spent all the money. However, he does not remember what he has spent in. This shows the problem of spending money without managing, in comparison with the effect of managing money.
 
Taking all these things into account, I firmly believe that learning to manage money from the age of child is significant. It helps us to avoid monetary problems as well as to enjoy their life in future.",//,essay,::
Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.,//,"In old days, the society has not been developed much. So, almost everyone think that their communities need to be developed at that time. Then, they tried to put a lot of time into their communities to live better lives. However, the society has changed a lot, so that young people who live in modern age are not interested in their communities. Rather, they think things related to themselves more important. I also think more about individuals than groups.
 
 Nowadays, young people are concerned about their future because companies have reduced employment recently. Then, many young people should compete against each other to get a better job. To survive in the competition, they have to prepare for an English score and the internship and even voluteer work experience. Otherwise, their future might be unclear. So, that’s why young people focus on themselves rather than communities.
 
I am sure that another reason is that the technology has been developed a lot nowadays and it made our lives more convenient. Let me give one example of a mobile phone which is well-known as one of the most developed inventions in modern times. Young people spend a lot of time on doing their mobiles with a variety of applications. There are SNS(social network service), e-book and the Internet. They can find some information that they want and make new friends from other countries now. There are so many things to do using a mobile phone in modern days.
 
Taking these two reasons into account, I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. A majority of young people who want to get a good job should try hard to win the competition. In lifestyle, the technology has been already made breakthrough, so many things that we can not imagine in the past can be happened using a mobile phone.",//,essay,::
Should teachers be paid based on students' performances for the benefits of both students and teachers?,//,"Some people say that when teachers are paid based on students' performances, the education of school would be improved since it is clear that we are living in materialism society. However, as far as I'm concerned, teachers should not evaluated only by their students' grades for two reasons: teachers have to pay attention to not only how to teach effectively, and students would not no longer thank teachers' efforts on class. 
 
 First of all, teachers should also give attention to character education as well as class. This is very important and time-consuming education while the result rarely appears to be good grades. The purpose of schools is not only in improving students' intellectual ability, but also growing them as good members of society. Since we are living together having interactions, there is more possibility that success in life is up to one person's character like responsibility, morality, not rely upon how much knowledge they have. For example, There is a hairdressor from Korea who succeed in Philippines as a boss of tens of shops. Actually, he was not a honor student because he didn't like studying general subjects. However, he met a homeroom teacher when he was in middle school who always encouraged him to find his talent and emphasized and let know like growing leadership, time-management skill, and endurance are so important in life than winning good grades. He said that from the teacher, he got courage, got to know how to live an independant life, and he found his flair and decided to be a hairdressor. Even he said that his enterprise at present would not exist if she did not encouraged him. In this sense, we can know teachers' education much affect one's life,and this is not knowlege, but wisdom. Wisdom does rarely appear as students' grades, but it is essential for teachers to teach. When teachers are evaulated and paid only with their teaching skill, they are more likely to spend less time how they can make their students wiser and good members of society. Thus, I strongly believe that teaching skill cannot be a standard how much they get paid.
 
 Also, the relationship between students and teachers would more likely to be superficial. This is because students would think that the reason teachers spend long time how to teach effectively is only for his or her better finance, not from love for students. There is believe that educators are the people who educate students to cultivate good social being, so pupils respect their teachers since they feel teachers love their being although they get salaries. If such policy come to be true, they would regard the teachers who put a lot of efforts into class just instructors, and pupils would not also realize the true heart of educators to enhance their intellectual ability which let them live with widen perspectives. According to a survey conducted by psychology department of Chicago university, There was huge difference between two groups: A group of schools enacted the salary policy based on students' performances, and B group did not. The students of the schools of A group tended not to follow educators' advice, and the rate of the juvenile delinquent was higher about 30 percent more. Moreover, they were thinking teachers only educate for their financial condition, and they are not loved by them. In this sense, how well teach students should not be a criteion for educators' salaries.
 
 In short, if educators get paid based on students' peformances, for their high salaries, they would not spend enough time making students suitable members of society, and students would not appreciate their teachers' endeavor to develop teaching skill because they would think their effort is for money, not for love for pupils. For above reasons, I firmly disagre with the statement that teachers should get paid accoeding to their students' performance.",//,essay,::
"At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support.",//,"Some people claims that universities and colleges should not spend a great deal of money om sports and social activities, as their budgets should prioritize classes and libraries. However, as educational institutions, universities and college have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help them deveop academically and socially.

First of all, more and more business require people who are not only specialists in their fields, but also skilled in social interaction. In the rapidly changing environments of science and the economy, no task can be done by a single person. Given the need for collaboration, social skills and team spirit are necessary qualities for any successful person. Clearly, sports and social activities in universities and colleges provide students with the perfect settings to practice their social skills. By playing football on a team or joining in a protest, for instanace, students can develop a sense of belonging and experience team spirit, both of which may prove very important in building a career.

In addition, sports and social activities can greatly improve student’s efficiency. Students need not play sports or participate in social activities at the expense of their academic study. Indeed, for some students, playing sports and joining in social activities are good stress reducers. Even the most enthusiastic people feel tired if they focus on their one thing for too long. Frustrated and tired people can do nothing well if they do not recover from their bad situations. Students who have been frustrated in their academic work would be well-advised to play some sports or join in social activities. This demonstrates that universities  and colleges should spend adequate money on academics as well as sports and social activities.

To sum up, I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social movements to prepare students for their future development.  ",//,essay,::
Teachers should not present their personal views on politics in the classroom.,//,"Various opinions may exist over whether teachers should not present their personal views on politics in the classroom. As far as I am concerned, I am in complete disagreement with the argument. The two ideas stated below can be sufficient evidence to support my disagreement.

My first argument for teachers' personal views on politics should be espoused. This is because they help students to be well-balanced. While students grow up, they are exposed to certain types of the information and knowledge about the world, through education at school as well as at home. The problem with this is that most of information and knowledge is conveyed from one source's particular viewpoint. Given this, in order to be well-informed, students try to learn about different viewpoints through their teachers' personal views on politics. In my case, I acquired information about exploring space by chatting with my friends. Due to the friends, I came to be fully exposed to the great achievements of governmental space projects. However, my perspectives on these governmental projects could not be solely positive when I knew the difficulty of exploring space and frequent struggles with political parties involved through my teacher's views on politics in the classroom. Without these political view points, I might have held a slanted view of what was going around me.

Moreover, my strong support for teachers' private ideas on politics can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that they can allow students to get the latest information. Our world is evolving at a surprising speed. As a result, students may have difficulty understanding all of the changes and new events come about. Given this context, it is important that they try to keep current by learning about changes and events through their teachers' personal views on politics. In a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly two thirds of surveyed students felt that they could update their knowledge and successfully adjust themselves to the changing social trends through different views on politics by their teachers in the classroom. According to the surveyed students, these personal political views prevented them from being confined to an outdated world. It is no surprise that there has recently been a drastic increase in the number of students who love to hear their teachers' personal views on politics to gain the latest knowledge of the world.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that students can become well-rounded by accepting their teachers' personal views on politics in the classroom. By doing so, they can also avoid becoming biased and outdated. These two reasons both connect to students' increasing need to accurately understand the world around them.",//,essay,::
It is more important to give students awards for their effort rather than give awards for achievement.,//,"All people try their best to obtain their aim, but most of them fail to get the success even though they work really diligently. Furthermore, some people acquire unintended result though they do not work hard. It is quite unfair for those who study rally hard. Therefore, we should recognize the effort of journey of people. In that way, we could hearten people to try their goal again, and be more helpful in the future. Lastly, realizing only success is malicious way of assessing person's nature.

 If we encourage people who fail to obtain their achievements, it would give them a tremendous effect. For instance, he could get the willing to try again and overcome this complicated situation whenever he faces it. In contrast, we did not try to recognize the effort of failed person, it would trigger detrimental consequences. In Korea, most of high school students have gotten innumerable pressures from their studying. They work really hard to go to famous university. However, this reason sometime bring bad situation like committing suicides. The most adequate reason to explain their suicide is their parent. Their parent only seeks the better grade then the student gets and seeks the good result. This greed of student's parent led their children to die. If they just hearten their children to try again. Their child does not need to commit this perilous behavior and successfully achieves their goals.

 Most of people get the energy or motivation through people they love or respect. This willing is really tremendous, so it makes people to not relinquish again when they conflict the situation they struggle with. If not, they could be obsessed with success and finally undermine the situation. Therefore, we should realize the effort of one’s. The person with successfully overcome the intricate situation is more likely to success, because they know how to deal with problem they encountered before. In other words, they endure their problem by other’s encouragement.

 Evaluating people with their fortune and property is vicious way to assess people. All people have totally different characteristic and way of thinking, so we should carefully judge people. There is some old fairy story that perfectly matches with this idea. Long time ago, there is a very rich old man. He does not know how to socialize with other, because he spends his whole life to make money. After the rich man retires from his work, he decides to make friends. As time goes by, the rich man successfully makes two friends. His first friend uses to avoid pay money, while his second friend is willing to pay the money during playing time. One day, the rich man loses his all money to defrauder. He does not have any place to sleep. Therefore, we go to his first friend’s house, but he refuses the rich man to sleep at his house when he hears the story. The old man gets shocked and he finally realizes that he was wrong. At that moment, the second friend finds the old man is sitting on the street. He brings the old man without asking why and let him to live in his house until he catches the defrauder. Throughout this happening, the old man recognized how to assess the people.

Most people work really hard and some of them succeed in obtaining their goal, while the others fails to achieve their aim. When one of our surrounded people faces this happening, we should hearten them to try again instead of compelling them to try again.",//,essay,::
Being different from others is helpful for achieving success.,//,"There is an argument over whether being different from others is helpful for achieving success. Some might argue that being same with other people is better. However, in my view, it is better to be different from others for success. There are several reasons that I could support my argument so I will limit the discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. First, people can save money. Also, people can get expertise.

To begin with, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people can save money. Most often, money tends to be very important in our everyday lives. If people are different from others, they will make the most of their money. Take my uncle, for example. It is very efficient to be different from others. My uncle did not waste money for drinking when he was in college. In contrast, his friends were drinking every week like other people. Thus, they spent much money when they were college student. Unlike his friends, my uncle did not spend money for drinking for 7 years and made their own restaurant by using that money. This result clearly shows that being different from others help people become successful because of efficiency.

Moreover, another reason which proves my point is that people can get expertise. Commonly in society, many accomplished people tend to have expertise. Therefore, people can succeed if they are different from others because it help them get expertise. A really good example can be seen in Minhan Kim. I read online that Kim, the CEO of the CS company, achieved great success because he was different from others. Kim, using this expertise, transformed his company one of the most profitable software enterprises in Korea. When he was high school student, he did not study to go to university like other students in Korea. He did not go to university, but made programs on and on. As a result, he made a great program and earned prestige. This example clearly shows that it is better to be different from others because of expertise.

To summarize, I believe that being different from others is helpful for achieving success on the grounds that people can save money and also people can get expertise.",//,essay,::
What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,//,"There are some crucial aspects to become a good supervisor. I strongly believe that someone who wants to be a great boss should have diligence, confidence and warm heart. These three traits are the most necessary components for a good supervisor.
 
To begin with, diligence is the most significant thing among many other qualities because there would be no success if someone is very lazy. There is a proverb that ""Early bird catches bugs"". Likewise, it is the most fundamental quality for supervisor who manages many people under his or her hand. If a company have an idle boss, it would ruin very quickly. For example, there was a chairman of some company, he always drank every night and did not care any tasks of the company. Eventually, he got fired because his subordinates completely hated him.
 
Also, confidence is substantial trait of a good supervisor's requirement. Generally, a supervisor manages a lot of subordinates under his feet. To lead many people's opinion, the leader should have great leadership that never sway by other assertions. If he would not decide his will or would not gather other people's diverse arguments, the company's policy would face a lot of problems. For instance, when I was a chairman of the committee at my work, I did not make a crucial decision due to some subordinate's opposition. However, that hesitation resulted in a bigger confusion.
 
In addition, a warm-hearted mind is needed to someone who would like to be a great supervisor. This characteristic can obtain much better respect from subordinates. In all likelihood, no one would not like the supervisor who has a nice manner and is very kind. It is said that someone gives a goodwill to others, he will return it as much as he was given. Therefore, if someone utterly wants to be a great boss, he should have a thoughtful mind to others.

To conclude, there are some indispensable elements to be a good advisor. they are diligence, confidence and warm heart. If someone has these traits already, he would be a truly fine supervisor.",//,essay,::
The best way to relax and reduce stress is by spending some time alone.,//,"As to the statement that the most appropriate methods to relieve stress is to have personal time, I strongly agree with it. That’s because it is more easier to enjoy free time and there are lots of recreations that one person can enjoy.

First, If people have a pastime alone, they do not need to be careful about other things. Specifically, playing with friends require to arrange meeting time, places and what they will do. This is possible to cause additional stress for an individual because it is time-consuming and hard to reconcile the options. For example, I have always loved to go hiking in mountains, and if I go there with someone, I would feel uncomfortable since I should consider the routes and how much we will walk. However, when I go hiking alone, I don’t need to worry about specific plans. I am able to choose courses to which I am attracted. In this regard, I believe that spending leisure time alone allows people to enjoy more easily.

Second, nowadays, people don't need to find friends purposely to be recharged. It was fairly common for people in the past to have their free time with others, as going to beach or playing group sports. On the other hand, in today’s society, there are numerous entertainment every person can enjoy without gathering other people. For example, my father used to play soccer after school because it is hard to find a variety of pleasures in his town. He virtually did not have choice but to play physical activities. In contrast, in modern society, people have made various pastimes such as computer games, watching shows and doing something through smart phones. These are sometimes more interesting and don't require other person. This is why I don't think that group activities is necessary to relieve stress.

To sum up, enjoying pastimes alone is more better in some ways because people can arrange their time comfortably and there are many enjoyments that only a single person can enjoy.",//,essay,::
It is more enjoyable to have a job where you work only three days a week for long hours than to have a job where you work five days a week for shorter hours.,//,"Some people might say that working five days a week for short hours is preferred because they can work with strong but short concentration. However, in my opinion, working three days a week for long hours is better for following reasons: We can relieve our stress by enjoying a hobby or having a journey.
 
For the primary reason, people can enjoy their hobby with enough time. Enjoying own hobby has an influence on psychological happiness. Thus, having a hobby is the best for spending holidays. However, there are things to do during holidays such as home chores, meeting friends. It is not easy to make time for enjoying own hobby. For example, in my country, people generally work for five days a week. It is rare to find people who enjoy their hobby within the two other days because most of the people think these holidays fly easily, just for taking a rest or having time with their family. Of course some might say working five days a week for short hours can use their after-working time, which is relatively longer than working three days a week, but it is not easy to manage after-working time as they think due to getting tired. Enjoying own hobby has an influence on psychological happiness Therefore, I prefer to working three days a week for long hours.
 
My next reason for supporting working three days a week for long hours is because workers can go travel during their holidays. Travel allows people not only to stress out, but also to increase productivity. To be specific, through travelling, people can enjoy their life at a distance. Seeing a wonderful landscape and eating a delicious food will give a sound body with a sound mind. They will be ready for getting back to work place with good condition. Good condition will bring a strong passion and enthusiasm. They will work hard even they have to work for long hours, and this will affect their future promotion. Following this repertory, people will be full of positive mind and praise their life. This is my reason why working three days a week is good.
 
To sum up, working three days a week for long hours is better option than the other because this option enables workers to manage their time easily. Making/enjoying a hobby or going travel really works for stress-out and this allows people to fall in love with their happy life, even their jobs.",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Movies and television have more negative effects than possible positive effects on young people.",//,"Some people argue that watching televised programs on TV would have positive effects on youth because it enables them to experience the world indirectly so that it is educational. However, I am of believer of the opposite is true. To elaborate, TV programs nowadays contain inappropriate contents and it is addictive in a way that it prevents the young to have healthier activities outdoor.
 
To begin with, visual images on TV in recent years display quite violent and inappropriate images for the youth to watch. The problem here is that these images will have negative effect on teenagers and adolescents because their mind is not as concrete as those of adults and they are vulnerable to these images in a way that it will affect their future behavior. To illustrate, one research done by Seoul National University of South Korea, those teenagers who watched violent images such as gunshots or fistfights showed 80% higher tendency to display violent act than those who did not. Therefore, TV programs today which depict much of these images will have definite negative effect on the youth.
 
Another equally important reason is that watching TV can be addictive so that it prevents teenagers to have healthier outdoor activities. TV programs are becoming bolder and bolder in its way of expression to attract more viewers. That is, they try to capture people’s eyes constantly to keep them in front of TV. Such despicable effort will lure young people to watch TV for all day long, resulting in unhealthy habit sitting face-to-face with TV screen every day. Such habit would eventually lead to reduction of physical health and solitary life style.
 
In conclusion, I believe watching TV programs for teenagers only brings negative results, because TV programs illustrate unhealthy images for the young and it lures vulnerable mind of teens to stare at the screen all day. In this regard, it is imperative to say that advantage of watching TV outweighs disadvantages.",//,essay,::
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
Young people enjoy life more than older people.",//,"Some argue that when people get older, there would not be many excitements and leisure activities to enjoy as much as when they are younger. However, in my opinion, elderly would have their own time of their lives and enjoy much as they did when they were young. That is, older people spend their leisure time in different way than younger people. Moreover, they are much more satisfied and experienced than the young so they know how to please themselves.
 
To begin with, the elders spend their leisure time different from the young people have good times. To elaborate, the youth would spend their time pursuing excitements such as drinking, clubbing, or active sports such as football, tennis or soccer. In contrary, older people pursue peaceful and relaxing leisure such as reading in café, playing poker games, or just a simple walk during on a warm day. Such activities are enough for the old people to enjoy. For example, when I went to Bali, Indonesia, there were many retired elderly who visited. They were having time of their lives enjoying beach walk, having good conversation in cafes, and reading while sunbathing. In this regard, I do not think that the young will have more fun than the old.
 
On top of that, since old people are more experienced and satisfied, they can enjoy more comfortably. To illustrate, most of the elderly underwent many things so they know what they want. They probably tried many leisure activities and know exactly which activities they themselves enjoy or not. Therefore, there is no waste of time or money to discover which is good for them. Moreover, most of them have already achieved their goal or dream, so they are more satisfied with their life than the young. As their satisfaction level is higher than the youth, they will spend their extra time much happier.
 
To wrap up, I am a strong believer of old people enjoy life as much as young people do. Since the old people are more experience and knows what they want in addition to the fact that they are much more satisfied with their lives, and they have different way of relaxing and enjoy from the young, it is wrong to say the young have better way of enjoying life.",//,essay,::
In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.,//,"Along with the development of technology, many people have their own cars compared to the past twenty years. Then, what would happen in next twenty years? While some assert that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than are today, others argue in the opposite perspective opinion. Personally, the latter opinion seems much more persuasive for development of cars and economical reasons. 

To begin with, in twenty years, every person can buy the cars because of their cheap prices. This is primarily due to the fact that development of alternative energy such as hydrogen, sunshine power and water. To be specific, these new cheap energy will replace expensive fossil fuel energy. Actually, the cost of using car is highly expensive because of the continually increasing cost of fuel; therefore, cheaper fuel would lead to increasing consumption of cars. A research on fuel was carried out at Seoul University. According to the study, 78 percent of 20s people would buy their future cars if the fuel is cheaper. This result clearly shows that in twenty years many people will afford to buy their cars.

Secondly, car is the most convenient transportation and it will be same in twenty years either. To illustrate further, although developed technology made airplanes, we do not use airplane in our daily lives. This shows that driving car is the best for our routine lives. In twenty years, there might be a new fascinating transportation; however, using car will be the most suitable method to go near places. For example, most people use their car when they go other places, especially in Korea. According to the study of Korean University, 89 of people responded to use their car among 7 transportations and they said that it is because car is the most convenient and comfortable for them. The research demonstrates that most of people feel comfortable regarding cars.

In conclusion, even in twenty years, there will be more cars in use than today. This is because the price of using car will be decreased and the car is the most convenient transportation for people.  ",//,essay,::
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? High school students should be allowed to choose some of their classes.,//,"Some argue that it is better for high school students to study fixed curriculum because it will teach them necessary education, therefore better prepared for college. However, I am of a believer the opposite is true. Having to choose courses offer students to figure out what their real interests are. Moreover, it is much more effective in terms of learning, because they feel more responsibility.

First of all, giving freedom for high school students to choose some of their classes will provide them opportunity to find out what they are really interested in. To elaborate, since students are not fully aware of their true academic pursuits, having choices what to study will provide them to get a taste of many fields so that they can find the particular study that they want to go deeper. A research done by Department of Education of Korea, students who went to school where students had some freedom of choosing course had 40% better academic achievement compared to students who went to the school where had fixed curriculum all along. The department concluded that the reason for this better academic achievement was students who had choices what to learn during high school realized their career goal earlier than those who had not. Looking at this research result, it is obvious that it is better for high school students to have some extent of freedom to choose their classes.

Moreover, it is much effective way of learning because students would feel responsible to their choices. Since they chose their courses by themselves, they will have much more responsibility to be good at it than studying what they are given. Therefore, they will put more effort on the class. For example, I exerted bigger effort to the classes that I chose than the one that was fixed during my high school years because I wanted to be responsible to my choice.

Teachers should not make their social and political views known to students in the classroom.,//,"As to the statement that teachers could express their own opinion in regard to  certain social or political events, in my views, it has some problems and teachers should avoid showing their personal thoughts about these things. There are two reasons: students are so young and susceptible to a teacher’s words that students can have biased view and imparting specific knowledge is educator’s primary duty.
  
First, teacher’s remarks about sensitive issues are very influential to their students, so they would be likely to grow concept that is similar to their teacher’s idea. It is evident that if one teacher supports one particular party or one-sided position, it definitely leads students to take a stance analogous to teacher’s thoughts. For example, according to research by the Korea University, in the test, researchers set two divided classes. One teacher explained the Iraq War as a way to attain world peace, while the other one portrayed the war caused by the invasion of the US to obtain Oil. Surprisingly, after each teacher finished their descriptions, students followed the positive or native view against the war at high rates. It demonstrated that how partial and biased view can be made by teachers’ own perspective.

Second, not only does it disrupt students to cultivate impartial view related to political and social events, in term of a teacher’s duty, it also can not be allowed to let students know what the teacher’s view is. That is, most students come to school to learn specific knowledge so that they are able to prepare easily to pursue a future career or to enter into top universities. However, if teachers focus on imparting ambiguous ones, which contain political perspective, some of students would regard it as a waste of time because it may not be helpful to prepare their crucial exams. This is true that students are require to grow their own view about social affairs since they are also one of the members in society, but I am convinced that it is not the teacher’s job.

In summary, if possible, teachers have to avoid showing their personal perspective toward sensitive subjects like political or social affairs. This is because students are highly influential to teacher’s words and because teachers should concentrate on giving practical learning.",//,essay,::
"Should government support athletics like an Olympic team or should they support art, such as museum and exhibit?",//," At the time that countries were having war with each others, it was mandatory for them to expand their territories and colonize other country in order to expedite their strides. Furthermore, indoctrinating their cultures or languages to country that they successfully colonized is essential works because of forestalling the rebellions of colonized country. However, we are living in peaceful and cohesive society nowadays, so most of countries are competing with each other by showing their athletic skill or their unique style of art. If government should support one between them, they should endorse the arts rather than supporting the athletics. Supporting arts is not only teaching lesson about history and culture, but also it could promote the tourism.
 
 First and foremost, tourism is crucial task for countries to show their traditions and efficient way to afford the money. Furthermore, arts could enhance the tourism by showing the greatest work from famous painter or writer from the past, so it could expedite the stride of countries’ economy. Italy and England is perfect example of this case. Almost million people are dropping by these countries in order to appreciate or see the works of Leonardo da Vinci or William Turner etc. Furthermore, the visitor often purchases the monument of hallmark of the region. Throughout this process, countries are earning tremendous of money unless these greatest works are stolen by thief. The government can facilitate the money that they obtain from tourism by augmenting more public infrastructure or ameliorating the service of tourism. 
 
 Most of art pieces reflect the life style of people in era that they involved and the tradition that people possess. For example, if one country suffered from colonizing of other country, the art works of colonized country would mostly show the dark or gloomy atmosphere, and sometime show their tradition stealthily. In contrast, the artworks from well-developed country could display the elegance and grace side atmosphere. When Korea was colonized by Japan, many ceramists were kidnapped and compellingly went to Japan in order to teach the techniques of making Korean ceramic. After Japan took a advantage of Korean ceramist, they killed the ceramist mercilessly. Therefore, the ceramic from colonized period show erratic and blunting surface, and most of them engraved Korean traditional painting.

 First of all, if government pay more attention to environmental concerns, health problems will naturally decrease. Environmental pollution is one of the leading factors of disease nowadays. Therefore, if government increases its investment in environmental protection and enforces stricter laws, it can consequently cut its budget for health care.  For instance, if someone suffers lung cancer which is usually known to be caused by air pollution, this person will probably rely on government subsidies to receive expensive treatments. If government had paid more attention to regulating environmental pollution in the first place, government would not have had to spend a dime on this person. Consequently, government should pay more attention to environmental concerns as a long term solution to health problems. 
 
Secondly, environmental issues cannot usually be handled individually while each person can look after own health. Environmental problems are global concerns which require the initiatives of government. For example, the deforestation in Amazon is causing severe global scale problems such as global warming. However, there is a limit to what individuals can do to stop these without help of government. On the other side, health problems can be dealt individually by regularly exercising and maintaining healthy diet. There is nothing much government can do except for financially subsidizing patients. Having said all, government should prioritize environmental problems. 
 
In conclusion, government should take environmental issues more seriously than health care because reducing environmental problems can be a solution to health problems and health care can be handled individually.

People who do not accept criticism from others cannot be successful at working in a group.,//,"There has been heated debate over the issue of whether people who do not accept criticism from others cannot be successful at working in a group. While there are many good arguments for both positions, the following argument will explain in detail why I agree.
 
My first argument for the influence of people should be espoused. This is because people play critical roles in developing our untapped talents. Modern-day people live hectic lives because today's globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. Consequently, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the fields of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for people to help us to develop our talents and tap into our full potential. Therefore, people' influence cannot be overlooked in this context.  According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people who are under the close guidance of their co-workers and boss at their workplace decide on their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not. The majority of education experts argued that people are likely to be unproductive if they do not fully receive the advice and help of their peers and boss, especially when they are in their potential stages. 
 
Moreover, my strong support for people' influence can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that people, with their years of experience, can offer lessons on morality and ethics. People who are not still mentally immature have long way to go before they become experts in their fields. During this long journey, they tend to make many mistakes and are prone to misbehave. However, people can be guided by their closer friends and mates, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms and can thus become good models for society. In this respect, people exert good influence on us. For example, undeveloped people may give in to the temptation of playing computer games allnight long because they are too immature to judge right from wrong. This is why others influence is an urgent need. With the guidance of people around us  such as co-workers or boss of us, we can learn how to avoid such temptations and become law-abiding citizens, by listening to our advisers' descriptions of their own experiences. Through such lessons, we can become holistic beings.
 
In a nut shell, my discussion above presents two stronger arguments for people' influence which I believe effectively convince the reader.

"For success in school or work, having ability to adapt to changing conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge of a field.",//," Various opinions may exist over whether having ability to adapt to changing conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge of a field for success in school or work. As far as I am concerned, I am in complete disagreement with the argument. The two ideas can be sufficient evidence to support my disagreement.
 
My first argument for having excellent knowledge of a field for success in school or work should be espoused. This is because it helps us to be well-informed for success in school or work. While we grow up, we are exposed to certain types of the information and knowledge about the world, through education at work as well as at school. The problem with this is that most of the information and knowledge is conveyed from one source's particular viewpoint. Given this, in order to be well-informed, we try to learn about different viewpoints from information through excellent knowledge of a field. In my case, I acquired information about space exploration by taking society class at university. Due to the class, I came to be fully exposed to the great achievements of governmental space projects. However, my perspectives on these governmental space projects could not be solely positive when I knew the difficulty of exploring space and huge budgets involved through doing my class assignments. Without these excellent knowledge of a field, I might have held a slanted view of what was going around me.
 
Moreover, my strong support for broad knowledge of a field for success in school or work can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that it can allow us to get the latest information. Our world is evolving at a surprising speed. As a result, we may have difficulty understanding all of the changes and new events come about. Given this context, it is important that we try to keep current by learning changes and events through having excellent knowledge of a field. In a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly two thirds of respondents felt that they could update their knowledge and successfully adjust themselves to the changing environments through having excellent knowledge of a field. According to the respondents, these broad knowledge prevented them from being confined to an outdated world. It is no surprise that there has recently been a drastic increase in the number of people who have excellent knowledge of a field to gain the latest knowledge of the world.
 
In conclusion, it is undeniable that people can become well-rounded and successful by having excellent knowledge of a field. By doing so, they can also avoid becoming biased and outdated for their success at work as well as in school. These two reasons both connect to our increasing need to completely succeed in school or work.",//,essay,::
University athletic departments should receive the same amount of funding as university libraries. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,//,"Usually, libraries have been considered to be the yardstick judging academic width and richness of the universities. Even though facilities, systems and the amount of books in libraries have been considerably factored in by each college, athletic facilities and the importance of maintaining students' physical health were not deemed to be significant. However, now is the time that universities equally fund athletic departments and libraries, since physical health is seriously interwined with mental health as well as academic motivation, and there are many learners who learn much more effectively during/after moving their body.
 
Firstly, athletic department should be equally supported as library because funding support in athletic department can directly lead to improvement of university's diverse extracurricular activities about exercise, and athletic equipment and facility, which will greatly benefit the whole students' health. Since physical health hugely affects mental health and academic motivation, more funding for athletic departments will surely improve overall happiness and efficiency in learning. My friend was too obsessed with getting high score on the test once before, so she studied all days except for the meal time without moving her body. As a result, she sufferred from illness, as well as lost momentum in studying. Later, when she tried to regularly exercise, all the problems were solved.
 
Secondly, it is said by the pedagogists that a type of learners learn more effectively when they move their body. It is very likely that this kinesthetic type of learners are more included in athletic departments than in other majors, and this can be a just reason claiming the need to fund the athletic departments to the equal degree with libraries, since both of them are there for the same reason: to facilitate students' effective study.
 
Therefore, universities should equally fund athletic departments and library because increased funding for athletic departments will enhance general athletic facility and exercise activity which will improve overall physical and mental health, as well as academic motivation of students, and kinesthetic learners will benefit from increased funding. Just as libraries, forming supportive environment on campus for exercise and athletic activities can significantly enhance students' quality of campus life.",//,essay,::
