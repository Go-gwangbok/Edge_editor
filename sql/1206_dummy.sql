INSERT INTO `essay` VALUES(55, '\nWhat are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.', '"As more and more people are seeking after a job where it offers a fine salary, people begin to realize that having a good supervisor is another important fact when considering for a job. In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. However, I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.\n\nFor starters, good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees promote faster and that is what they do in their position at work. In addition, this not only make the employees enhance their positions but paves the way to make company a better reputation by having good leaders. For example, my older sister, who finished graduate school, got a job where it gives enough salary. Afterwards, my sister had a supervisor who had a very strong leadership. Since the boss led my sister very well with good judgement and nice advices, she promoted much faster than her friends from graduate school. This implies that strong leadership is a very important characteristic of a good supervisor.\n\nSecondly, friendly leader is probably what the all employees are wishful to have at their work place. This is because most of the workers from all over the world suffer from stresses at work because of high pressure from boss or because of unfriendly environment.However, if a leader is very friendly, that will create much comfortable atmosphere where all of the employees can work with such enjoyment and that will eventually lead to a long term work. To be more detailed, there was a survey among the workers from renowned company about the reason why they work in the long term. Not surprisingly, about half of them answered because of the high name value of the company, but other half of them responded that it is because of good leaders who are very friendly. This definitely implies the important quality of a good supervisor is a amiable personality.\n\nOn the whole, even though the jury is still out, I firmly believe that having a good leadership and friendly personality is the most significant traits among others because of faster promotion and enjoyable atmosphere at work."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

However, I am convinced that twenties are the most important time of the life. That is because career is usually determined in twenties, and most people tend to get married in this period.\n \n To begin with, many people decide their future careers in this period. To be specific, people usually get first jobs in their twenties. University students start to work as full-time workers after they graduate, when they may be around 25, and this decision must be the most influential thing in their life, since lots of factors like future incomes, occupation satisfactions depend on their jobs.

After contemplating, I decided to get into an energy company. That was a huge opportunity in my life. I am so satisfied with working envirnment and enough payment. On the other hand, Plant engineering suffers from serious recession these days. If I chose to work for plant engineering company, I might struggle to find another job.\n \n On top of that, lots of people get married in their twenties. In fact, marriage is the most important decision in our life. Husband or Wife is the one, their spouse spend majority of time together for the entire life. Moreover, after marriage, we broaden and establish our relationships, which will affect our life enoumously. For instance, before I got married, I always felt very lonely. However, since I got married, my wife always took care of me and tried to be with me. So I became very happy with my life.

But these days, some people say that living in villages and farms area is more satisfied life. However, I think that living in the cities is more satisfied than living in the rural areas such as some villages or farms. That’s because people are likely to get better education and they are able to enjoy a lot leisure activities.\n \nFirst, the city people tend to get high quality education. Since most people live in the cities, the number of students in urban areas is definitely bigger than the rural areas. So, there exist many kinds of schools and academic centers in the downtown. Also, teachers or professors usually live near the schools. Therefore residents in the city can have a great chance to access the better educational atmosphere such as private educational institutes or graduate universities. According to the Education Ministry of Korea in 2008, the number of teachers per one metro city had double over last five years. But, the number of teachers per the countryside had decreased five times during the same time. It means that teachers or professors who have the special skills or knowhow moved the rural areas and came to the cities. The more teachers get together, the more educational quality grows up. So, students and children in the cities are able to enjoy the better educational environment.\n \nIn addition, the city residents can enjoy funny leisure activities very easily. In the cities, there are the countless restaurants, movie theaters and art museums. So, city dwellers tend to have the great time with their own families or friends by visiting there. Besides, unlike the farm towns, the city’s stores usually open all day and specialize more specific. For example, if we want to eat Indian foods in the holiday, then we just visit the Indian restaurant in the downtown. And, we are able to not only eat curry but also have the opportunity to eat some particular foods that we cannot read the menu by Indian words. My elder sister, Sue lives in the countryside because she raises tomatoes and peppers. Since at that town, there are no fast-food restaurants and movie theaters, she always has to drive the car about 40 minutes to the downtown for watching the action movies or eat pizza and hamburgers. She often said that it is very difficult, uncomfortable and annoyed.\n \nIn sum, I strongly believe that the city residents get more satisfied lives than the rural people due to the very fine education and leisure activates."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

The answer to this question can vary greatly, depending on the individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. In this essay, I present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.\n \nFirst of all, living in cities allows people to enjoy a better quality of life. This is attributed to the fact that it guarantees a stress-free life, while living in villages and farms can stress people out by pushing them to feel bored. Because the rural areas do not have interest things, such as theater or department store. Moreover, stress is one of the main factors that weakens immune system and causes harm to the body. According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2010, a test on mice showed that when they were regularly subjected to electric shocks, their life span was shortened. Interestingly, the researchers found a link between this and human beings who suffered from chronic stress. It can be inferred that living in villages and farms area can lead to high stress levels and this reduce people’s longevity.\n \nSecond, living in cities provides people with more conveniences in life. This is because compared to the rural area, people living in cities benefit from various kinds of inventions by advanced technology related in their daily lives. For instance, many live in apartments, which optimally utilize a smaller amount land, and use convenient transportation and mobile products such as smart phones or laptops. Especially the use of the speedy internet makes a big difference between them. In this respect, the advanced technology of cities has greater effect on providing more conveniences in life.\n \nIn conclusion, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. Once again, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales above are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

In my opinion, being passionate about what you do is essential to be successful in life. The reasoning behind this is that people with passion don''t give up easily and they have their own goal.\n To begin with, people with passion are energized enough to keep going even after few failures. There are only few people can succeed in one try and eveybody wants to be that few people. But in life, some failures are inevitable and some people might just quit after few trys. Nevertheless, passionate people can learn from their mistakes and failures and they always make progress on their work. To illustate this point, there was a many men like Bill Gates who wanted to make a computer affordable to common households. At the end, there was only him left because it was he who had the most passion and never gived up even after some failures. Being passionate about something can help people to become successful.\n On top of that, passionate people have their own goals. Success is the achievement of goals. People who are enthusiatic about their work set their goal and never give up. Some goals might seem ridiculous to others but they pursue them anyway. To give a personal example, when my grandmother first started to study psychology at the community center, everyone didn''t understanded her because she was in her 60''s. Even my parents thought it was too later for her to study new things. For my grandmother, what other people said didn''t mattered to her. She kept on studying and got her license in two years. Now, she is working at a community center as a part-time teacher. Her passion toward study was admirable and that is what made her push hard to achieve her goal.\n To summarize, I firmly believe that success is gained by passion. This is because people with never give up and aim for their goals. This is what makes successful people different from the rest of us.\n\n"', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

However, in my opinion, we cannot easily get a lot of information about a person through the books and movies for two reasons: people do not know whether the information they''ve got is real or not, and it is too limited to find the information from the books and movies.\n\nTo begin with, it is hard for us to recognize that the information is really true. this is because many famous actors, entertainers and athletes used to disguise them for public. they always want to show the advantageous aspects of them and hide their disadvantages. In this way, celebrities can make people see them as the person they want to be seen like. For example, korean people were so surprised that many famous korean entertainers are accused of habitual taking drugs. People always thought these celebrities are so kind and honest because movies and books make these celebrities to be seen like the man the public cannot imagine to do that. This implies that the information from the books and movies cannot be the tool for judging others accurately.\n\nOn top of that, it is too narrow range to find the information through the books and movies. This is due to the fact that people cannot put all of information into these books and movies and cannot easily find the information they want compared to the internet. We all know that now we are living in the information-age. we can easily find the vast data of information about a person through the one-click button on the internet. however, people cannot easily find out the information through the books and movies because these contain limited data. Suppose that we want to find the scandal issue of Mr. Jackson. If we try to get the information from the books and movies, we will have a terrible time to find such a thing. Contrarily, we can get more easily if we use the internet.\n\nTo sum up, finding information about a person via the books and movies is not a good idea because they are untrustworthy and limited.

However, I disagree with those people because of the following 2 reasons which are efficiency and\nless stress.\n \nFirst of all, having a job that pays a low salary but is secure is efficient. This is because it allows\npeople not to waste their money. Take my friend Tom for example. He normally spends a lot of money\nto buy clothes so he always suffered from lack of money. However, his attitude towards spending\nmoney changed a lot when he got a job that pays him low salary but is secure. He realized the importance of money and started not to waste them.

On the other hand, his best friend Jack was a man who never spend money to buy\nunnecessary things before he was hired by a company which offers him high salary but is not secure.\nHigh salary made he''s friends to call him every weekend to buy meals for them. Eventually, he spent all of his monthly payment only after two weeks from the date he recieved his money. What is worse\nwas the company he was hired from went out of business due to lack of budget. So he lost all of his \nfriends, his girl friend stood him up and his family turned their back against him. As experience of Tom\nand his friend Jack shows, low paying job but secure is more efficient than high paying jobs that are\nunsecure.\n                        \nOn top of that, low paying secure job allows people to have less stress. This is because the job can \nassure people that they are earning money. This reminds me of a time when I had a part time job. I got a high salary but unfortunately, is was unsecure. This gave a lot of stress because I had to pay the tuition fee all by myself and it gave me a thinking that I would not be able to continue my studies due to\nuncertainty of my paying day. I was so stressed out that I suffered from stomach ulcer and had to be\nhospitalized for two months. As my experience shows, high paying jobs but unsecure have a drawback thus it is not a good choice for people.\n \nIn a nutshell, if I have given a choice to choose between a low paying job but is secure and a high paying job but is unsecure, I will definately choose the former one because it is more efficient for me and\ngives me less stress than the later one."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

To support the argument, the people may cite the fact that many research has shown the result that the number of communication has significantly dropped among most of families recently. However, I firmly disagree with the argument with several reasons. In other words, the argument is problematic for the following reasons; the decreased number of communications within family and friends is caused by other factors. Moreover, recent media, such as Television or radio, can stimulate interaction among people.\n \nSome people assume that television has disturbed interaction within family or friends. However, this argument provides no evidence to support the assumption. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. For example, this is possibility that the lacks of communication are caused by other factors. In other words, this argument is vulnerable to the criticism that, if most of people who are not interacting with other people frequently has interested in debating or discussing through the internet after development of online communities, the argument cannot be valid in any sense. Moreover, Television can motivate communication among people. For example, In a recent survey, conducted by the Harvard Business Review in 2011, comparing to people who do not watch television at all, people who watch some dramas or news on television have a tendency to discuss with colleagues and family members. In other words, television can provide some sources to discuss for people who want to talk with other people.\n \nAll things considered, because the argument that television has destroyed communication among family and friends leaves out several key issues; it is not completely sound or persuasive. To strengthen the conclusion of the argument, the author should include above mentioned assumptions and provide evidences to support these assumptions.

There is a lot of truth in it. However, in my opinion, it is more advantages for people to visit a lot of manifold cities than reading societies through books for two reasons; practical assistance and valuable life lessons.\n To begin with, traveling other countries allows people to have practical assistance. Going abroad is possible for them to get a lot of helpful experience, it also enables people these days to have accumulated their own know-how in their careers or lives. Thus, they have many resources and skills with which to teach and guide non-experienced people. For example, I learned much more from my senior employees than from my peers when I first started working at a tour company. Because my peers did not have much work experience, we were not able to learn much from each other. On the other hand, the senior employees in my department taught me many important work skills, such as how to create effective presentations and how to safely handle the machinery in the lab. They helped me greatly, and thanks to them, I was able to acclimate easily to the work place.\n On the top of that, older people who have a more traveling adventure teach younger people valuable life lessons. This is due to the fact that, younger people can learn valuable lessons from older people who are more mature and tend to have understanding of life. In this respect, older people’s understanding can affect younger people’s lives in positive ways. For instance, after failing multiple times to pass the exam to become an English teacher, my sister became extremely discouraged. Most of her friends advised her to pursue a different career, and she soon stressed about her professional future. Meanwhile, my parents advised her to continue studying and try to pass the examination again. To encourage her to stick with her goal, they told her stories of how they overcame failures in their own lives. Because of their advised, my sister rose to the challenge, passed her exam, and finally became a teacher last year.\n To sum up, it is more important knocking other foreign countries doors in person than meet in books their countries.

Sometimes teachers have to be strict and tell their students off for doing something wrong. It is easy for a stranger to be strict on a child and teach them right morals. Nevertheless, parents are different. They can go easy on their children because they get moved by their tears. For instance, my parent taught me how to ride a bicycle. When I fall down, my parents were worried about me getting hurt and they stopped teaching me. So I have no choice but to learn it from my brother and I learned it more quickly. All in all, parents can be less strict when it comes to teaching their own child.\n On top of that, parents can be underqualified about the things they teach their children. Being a teacher can mean a lot of things. They have to fulfill their children academically because it is also important for students to develop in that way.

To illustrate this point, in some poor district, where illiteracy is high, the parents of the children don''t even know how to spell rather then teach them valuable lessons. As a matter a fact, parents discourage their children to learn because they think learning doesn''t help to make life easier.\n In conclusion, I firmly believe that their are better teachers in ones'' life than their parents.

This is because students often feel peer pressures, and they are at the same stage of being adults.\n\nTo begin with, students feel peer pressure which is a psychological state that they should follow the majority opinions among members of group even they do not want to. For example, I realized that my younger brother has been smoking when he was at the age of 17. I was surprised and then asked the reason why and how he stared to do that. He said that it was hard to reject his friends’ suggestion which is smoking. He felt like he is going to be bullied by them if he had not tried. Therefore, the peer pressure can be one of the reasons that friends are more influential on students than their teachers.\n         \nOn top of that, students, especially who are in their puberty, have more common things to share with their friends. To be specific, when they talked with their similar age of friends, they can easily share their emotions and understand each other much better than with their teachers.

After all, I found employment as a designer which makes me satisfactory over the other jobs.\n\nTo sum up, in the term of twenties, people should make vital decisions for their own highly satisfactory future. In this regard, I firmly believe that, the most essential moment in individual’s life is one’s twenties."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.', '"Frankly, each person has some golden periods in one’s life time and there are some who believe that the period might be one’s twenties. However, I strongly believe that the most important period is one’s sixties because of plentiful time, money and well organized thoughts.\n\nTo begin with, most of the twenties are too busy with choosing their careers and they are not wealthy enough to enjoy their lives or challenge for something new. For the person who is in the important period should be manifestly supported by money and time so that they can discover and plan their own future. According to the report by the Washington Citizens Foundation, seniors were better in accomplishing the things that they have planned because they had adequate amount of money and time. Also, their satisfactory in their lives were much higher than twenties as well. As the example shows, twenties cannot be the most important period because of money and time to try for something they really long for.\n\nIn addition, the young do not possess any of useful experience which means they are not ready to explore the world with the proper thoughts. On the other hand, seniors obviously have well developed knowledge which is useful and helpful to start their real life that they have wanted for the whole 50years. From my personal experience, my grandfather is a successful old man in his business field nowadays, while he had a big failure in his business when he was 25 years old. He had a hard time for a long time and he made an enterprise at age sixty which is now a successful and well-known company throughout the world. It was an experience that he has accumulated for a long time which brought him a fame and strong company.\n\nIn conclusion, I do strongly believe that twenties are not the most important period in one’s life."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');
INSERT INTO `essay` VALUES(72, '\n"In today''s society, having much money is more important that gaining public recognition."', '"In today''s society, it is widely believed that gaining public recognition is still more important tat haveing much money. Some people advocate that money can not buy one''s recognition from the society, the recognition that lasts forever. However, I disagree with this view. I firmly believe that making a lot of money is the far more crucial than receiving the respect. This is because first, money can make the reveration and second, money will create more chance to do something very helpful for people in the world.\n\nFirst of all, The finance power, itself is what people believe to be respect. In other words, More money I have, the more venerable things I have done, including studying hard, working hard and being smatter. For example, according to the study done by New York Times, it revealed that People hold that the money one has show the byproducts with which he made significant efforts in life, efforts that are people follow. This study show that the money is the result of rewards of people who have done all things worthy not only for themselves buy also human kind. If so, one with money have also admiration from people. This fact clearly show that earning wealthy is better to do that recognition.\n\nSecond, the money gives us more priceless opportunity benificial for the community. To be specific, The rich paying subtantial tax amount provides healthy support neighbourhood, making themselves abundant. They are also easy to spend much on the variety of commodity, with the result that capital circulates around them. To illustrate, Bill Gates who is one of the richest in the world and who was CEO of microsoft, the biggest computer software company paid uncountable amount of tax for the municipal. The tax was much more than was the case with ordinary people, so that the goverment provide high-quality education for the student who lived near the Mr. Gates. such as a laptop for each and real animals they can study. They were growned up as the people who remember the support they got and, actually, provides another chance to the community. On the other hand, if Bill gates had gotten only recognition as a respectable CEO without financing effect on local, the student would have not been people who offer more help to the area. This strongly refelcts that making money is more important.\n\nAll things considered, it is my belief that my argument regarding this topic effectively and preciesly delivered with the reasons mentioned above. Never should we forget that this will have huge impact for our future."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');
INSERT INTO `essay` VALUES(73, '\nPeople should try several different jobs before getting a long term job.', '"There is an argument over whether people should try several different job before getting long term job. Some might argue that doing several jobs is better. However, in my view, getting long term job at once is better. There are several reasons that I could support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. First, people can succeed. Also, people can save time.\n\nTo begin with, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people can become successful. Generally in society, many accomplished people tend to have expertise. Thus, it can be said that people can become successful because they can get expertise by getting long term job first. A really good example can be seen in Minhan Kim. I read online that Kim, the CEO of CS company achieved great success because he got his job at once. Kim, by using expertise, transformed his company into one of the most profitable software enterprises in Korea. He got his job in software company at once, so he could learn more useful skills than other programmers who entered software company later because of previous jobs. This example clearly shows that it is worse to try different jobs before getting a long term job because of success.\n\nMoreover, another reason which proves my point is that people can save much time. Most often, time is very important in our everyday lives. If people get their long term job at once, they will make the most of their time. Take my uncle, for example. It was really efficiency to get long term job at once. It took only 5 years to become senior manager in his company. In contrast, his friend Tom took 10 years to do same because he had got many different jobs before. Unlike Tom, my uncle did not have to spend time on unnecessary jobs. This result clearly shows that it is better to get long term job at once.\nAll things considered, with the reasons mentioned above, I believe I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');
INSERT INTO `essay` VALUES(74, '\nIt is better to have friends who are similar to you than those who are different from you.', '"Some people think that it is better to have friends who are similar to them than those who are different from them. However, in my opinion, different friends are much more helpful because with various friends, people can give and receive diverse opinion in same subject and are helped to adapt to society in the future as well as in the present. \n\nFirstly, friends who grew in the varied environment have definitely different opinion even in the same subject. When people communicate with them, they can broaden their view of the world and improve abilities of understanding other people. For example, in the High School, I have friends whom other classmates called them strange. In this time, I could really get and build broad mind because they make me like that. \n\nOn top of that, different friends help people to be able to adapt to society in the present and even in the  future. They are different in ways to meet and manage varying situations. When people watch them and are affected by the ways they receive the situations, they can develop their own way which they couldn’t take alone. For instance, after graduating High School when I grew with the friend I mentioned above, I really adapted well to University even if there are a lot of unkind and ungenerous people. I think it is due to my high-school friends’ lives. \n\nTo sum up, in the environment with different types of friends, people broaden their opinion of the world and can develop ability to live in the society without the bigger problem.

However, in my opinion, since there are many stakeholders of it and news makers have to consider populace’s interests, the news media have no choice but to going to biased direction.\n\nFirstly, a broadcasting station which broadcast the news has lots of stakeholders, resulting in familiar relationship with a market. It makes people in the media act partially, leading the stakeholders beneficial and advantageous. The studies have shown that according to contents of the news, the price of the stockmarket is volatile. People can easily see the example of it before the presidential election. According to types of stations, there are definitely different news of candidates which in one station, is better than expected and in other station, can’t be worse than the news about one candidate. It relates to stocks of each candidates.\n\nOn top of that, makers of the news media need to consider mass’s interests, which means that they contain a part of the issues of our society. This is because the news media is also mass media whose life is up to populace’s choices. For example, in these days there are a lot of crime news which often are unkind and crucial, even if actual crime rate is not high like that according to the researches. This is because most of people want to watch stimulating information.\n\nTo sum up, since there are lots of people who relate to the stock of the news and makers have to think about their audience, the news media is not a trustful source of unbiased information."', '2013-11-25 18:19:33', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

Some people advocate that money can not buy one''s recognition from the society, the recognition that lasts forever. However, I disagree with this view. I firmly believe that making a lot of money is the far more crucial than receiving the respect. This is because first, money can make the reveration and second, money will create more chance to do something very helpful for people in the world.\n\nFirst of all, The finance power, itself is what people believe to be respect. In other words, More money I have, the more venerable things I have done, including studying hard, working hard and being smatter. For example, according to the study done by New York Times, it revealed that People hold that the money one has show the byproducts with which he made significant efforts in life, efforts that are people follow. This study show that the money is the result of rewards of people who have done all things worthy not only for themselves buy also human kind. If so, one with money have also admiration from people. This fact clearly show that earning wealthy is better to do that recognition.\n\nSecond, the money gives us more priceless opportunity benificial for the community. To be specific, The rich paying subtantial tax amount provides healthy support neighbourhood, making themselves abundant. They are also easy to spend much on the variety of commodity, with the result that capital circulates around them. To illustrate, Bill Gates who is one of the richest in the world and who was CEO of microsoft, the biggest computer software company paid uncountable amount of tax for the municipal. The tax was much more than was the case with ordinary people, so that the goverment provide high-quality education for the student who lived near the Mr. Gates. such as a laptop for each and real animals they can study. They were growned up as the people who remember the support they got and, actually, provides another chance to the community. On the other hand, if Bill gates had gotten only recognition as a respectable CEO without financing effect on local, the student would have not been people who offer more help to the area.

Some might argue that doing several jobs is better. However, in my view, getting long term job at once is better. There are several reasons that I could support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. First, people can succeed. Also, people can save time.\n\nTo begin with, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people can become successful. Generally in society, many accomplished people tend to have expertise. Thus, it can be said that people can become successful because they can get expertise by getting long term job first. A really good example can be seen in Minhan Kim. I read online that Kim, the CEO of CS company achieved great success because he got his job at once. Kim, by using expertise, transformed his company into one of the most profitable software enterprises in Korea. He got his job in software company at once, so he could learn more useful skills than other programmers who entered software company later because of previous jobs. This example clearly shows that it is worse to try different jobs before getting a long term job because of success.\n\nMoreover, another reason which proves my point is that people can save much time. Most often, time is very important in our everyday lives. If people get their long term job at once, they will make the most of their time. Take my uncle, for example. It was really efficiency to get long term job at once. It took only 5 years to become senior manager in his company. In contrast, his friend Tom took 10 years to do same because he had got many different jobs before. Unlike Tom, my uncle did not have to spend time on unnecessary jobs. This result clearly shows that it is better to get long term job at once.\nAll things considered, with the reasons mentioned above, I believe I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."', '"Everyone has the urge to succeed in life. That is why we try to work hard and set our goals. Success in ones'' life may come from many different reasons. In my opinion, being passionate about what you do is essential to be successful in life. The reasoning behind this is that people with passion don''t give up easily and they have their own goal.\n To begin with, people with passion are energized enough to keep going even after few failures. There are only few people can succeed in one try and eveybody wants to be that few people. But in life, some failures are inevitable and some people might just quit after few trys. Nevertheless, passionate people can learn from their mistakes and failures and they always make progress on their work. To illustate this point, there was a many men like Bill Gates who wanted to make a computer affordable to common households. At the end, there was only him left because it was he who had the most passion and never gived up even after some failures. Being passionate about something can help people to become successful.\n On top of that, passionate people have their own goals. Success is the achievement of goals. People who are enthusiatic about their work set their goal and never give up. Some goals might seem ridiculous to others but they pursue them anyway. To give a personal example, when my grandmother first started to study psychology at the community center, everyone didn''t understanded her because she was in her 60''s. Even my parents thought it was too later for her to study new things. For my grandmother, what other people said didn''t mattered to her. She kept on studying and got her license in two years. Now, she is working at a community center as a part-time teacher. Her passion toward study was admirable and that is what made her push hard to achieve her goal.\n To summarize, I firmly believe that success is gained by passion. This is because people with never give up and aim for their goals. This is what makes successful people different from the rest of us.\n\n"', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

However, in my opinion, we cannot easily get a lot of information about a person through the books and movies for two reasons: people do not know whether the information they''ve got is real or not, and it is too limited to find the information from the books and movies.\n\nTo begin with, it is hard for us to recognize that the information is really true. this is because many famous actors, entertainers and athletes used to disguise them for public. they always want to show the advantageous aspects of them and hide their disadvantages. In this way, celebrities can make people see them as the person they want to be seen like. For example, korean people were so surprised that many famous korean entertainers are accused of habitual taking drugs. People always thought these celebrities are so kind and honest because movies and books make these celebrities to be seen like the man the public cannot imagine to do that. This implies that the information from the books and movies cannot be the tool for judging others accurately.\n\nOn top of that, it is too narrow range to find the information through the books and movies. This is due to the fact that people cannot put all of information into these books and movies and cannot easily find the information they want compared to the internet. We all know that now we are living in the information-age. we can easily find the vast data of information about a person through the one-click button on the internet. however, people cannot easily find out the information through the books and movies because these contain limited data. Suppose that we want to find the scandal issue of Mr. Jackson. If we try to get the information from the books and movies, we will have a terrible time to find such a thing. Contrarily, we can get more easily if we use the internet.\n\nTo sum up, finding information about a person via the books and movies is not a good idea because they are untrustworthy and limited.

Some people say that having a job that\npays a high salary but is easy to lose is better than having a job that pays a low salary but it is secure. However, I disagree with those people because of the following 2 reasons which are efficiency and\nless stress.\n \nFirst of all, having a job that pays a low salary but is secure is efficient. This is because it allows\npeople not to waste their money. Take my friend Tom for example. He normally spends a lot of money\nto buy clothes so he always suffered from lack of money. However, his attitude towards spending\nmoney changed a lot when he got a job that pays him low salary but is secure. He realized the importance of money and started not to waste them. Now he use his money wisely and never regrets after he\nuse them. On the other hand, his best friend Jack was a man who never spend money to buy\nunnecessary things before he was hired by a company which offers him high salary but is not secure.\nHigh salary made he''s friends to call him every weekend to buy meals for them. Eventually, he spent all of his monthly payment only after two weeks from the date he recieved his money. What is worse\nwas the company he was hired from went out of business due to lack of budget. So he lost all of his \nfriends, his girl friend stood him up and his family turned their back against him. As experience of Tom\nand his friend Jack shows, low paying job but secure is more efficient than high paying jobs that are\nunsecure.\n                        \nOn top of that, low paying secure job allows people to have less stress. This is because the job can \nassure people that they are earning money. This reminds me of a time when I had a part time job. I got a high salary but unfortunately, is was unsecure. This gave a lot of stress because I had to pay the tuition fee all by myself and it gave me a thinking that I would not be able to continue my studies due to\nuncertainty of my paying day. I was so stressed out that I suffered from stomach ulcer and had to be\nhospitalized for two months. As my experience shows, high paying jobs but unsecure have a drawback thus it is not a good choice for people.\n \nIn a nutshell, if I have given a choice to choose between a low paying job but is secure and a high paying job but is unsecure, I will definately choose the former one because it is more efficient for me and\ngives me less stress than the later one."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

To support the argument, the people may cite the fact that many research has shown the result that the number of communication has significantly dropped among most of families recently. However, I firmly disagree with the argument with several reasons. In other words, the argument is problematic for the following reasons; the decreased number of communications within family and friends is caused by other factors. Moreover, recent media, such as Television or radio, can stimulate interaction among people.\n \nSome people assume that television has disturbed interaction within family or friends. However, this argument provides no evidence to support the assumption. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. For example, this is possibility that the lacks of communication are caused by other factors. In other words, this argument is vulnerable to the criticism that, if most of people who are not interacting with other people frequently has interested in debating or discussing through the internet after development of online communities, the argument cannot be valid in any sense. Moreover, Television can motivate communication among people. For example, In a recent survey, conducted by the Harvard Business Review in 2011, comparing to people who do not watch television at all, people who watch some dramas or news on television have a tendency to discuss with colleagues and family members. In other words, television can provide some sources to discuss for people who want to talk with other people.\n \nAll things considered, because the argument that television has destroyed communication among family and friends leaves out several key issues; it is not completely sound or persuasive. To strengthen the conclusion of the argument, the author should include above mentioned assumptions and provide evidences to support these assumptions. Moreover, a recent survey has shown that television does not disturb communication but stimulate talks among people.

There is a lot of truth in it. However, in my opinion, it is more advantages for people to visit a lot of manifold cities than reading societies through books for two reasons; practical assistance and valuable life lessons.\n To begin with, traveling other countries allows people to have practical assistance. Going abroad is possible for them to get a lot of helpful experience, it also enables people these days to have accumulated their own know-how in their careers or lives. Thus, they have many resources and skills with which to teach and guide non-experienced people. For example, I learned much more from my senior employees than from my peers when I first started working at a tour company. Because my peers did not have much work experience, we were not able to learn much from each other. On the other hand, the senior employees in my department taught me many important work skills, such as how to create effective presentations and how to safely handle the machinery in the lab. They helped me greatly, and thanks to them, I was able to acclimate easily to the work place.\n On the top of that, older people who have a more traveling adventure teach younger people valuable life lessons. This is due to the fact that, younger people can learn valuable lessons from older people who are more mature and tend to have understanding of life. In this respect, older people’s understanding can affect younger people’s lives in positive ways. For instance, after failing multiple times to pass the exam to become an English teacher, my sister became extremely discouraged. Most of her friends advised her to pursue a different career, and she soon stressed about her professional future. Meanwhile, my parents advised her to continue studying and try to pass the examination again. To encourage her to stick with her goal, they told her stories of how they overcame failures in their own lives. Because of their advised, my sister rose to the challenge, passed her exam, and finally became a teacher last year.\n To sum up, it is more important knocking other foreign countries doors in person than meet in books their countries. This is because learning about foreign countries by use of visiting those can have positive impact on receive help from others and have a more comprehensive understanding of life.

Being a teacher can mean a lot of things. They have to fulfill their children academically because it is also important for students to develop in that way. In some cases, however, parents are underqualified to teach their children how to solve a math equation or teach them grammer. To illustrate this point, in some poor district, where illiteracy is high, the parents of the children don''t even know how to spell rather then teach them valuable lessons. As a matter a fact, parents discourage their children to learn because they think learning doesn''t help to make life easier.\n In conclusion, I firmly believe that their are better teachers in ones'' life than their parents. Children can find better teacher elsewhere because parents can have problem with being strict or teach them at all. It is better to kind a qualified teacher who understands the children better."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

However, in my opinion, I think students are influenced more by their friends than by their teachers. This is because students often feel peer pressures, and they are at the same stage of being adults.\n\nTo begin with, students feel peer pressure which is a psychological state that they should follow the majority opinions among members of group even they do not want to. For example, I realized that my younger brother has been smoking when he was at the age of 17. I was surprised and then asked the reason why and how he stared to do that. He said that it was hard to reject his friends’ suggestion which is smoking. He felt like he is going to be bullied by them if he had not tried. Therefore, the peer pressure can be one of the reasons that friends are more influential on students than their teachers.\n         \nOn top of that, students, especially who are in their puberty, have more common things to share with their friends. To be specific, when they talked with their similar age of friends, they can easily share their emotions and understand each other much better than with their teachers. This is because, when they are in their puberty, they are unstable condition about their physical and emotional changes. We can call this the stage of being adults. For instance, my cousin who is at the age of 13 and in puberty always complains about his parents. He talks about this to his friends who also have the same complains about their parents. Through this process, their relationship gets stronger affecting each other.\n \nTo sum up, there is a pressure that students feel pressured by their similar age group of friends. In addition, students have more common things to share with their friends, which help them to be bounded and affect each other. In this regard, I strongly believe that the students are influenced more by their friends than by their teachers.\n\n"', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

However, in my opinion, it is better to get information from many sources. This is because different news has sometimes different details, and because some news has sometimes mistakes.\n\nTo begin with, different news has different information even though they have same topic. Therefore, people can have more details. For example, I want to contrast two different news which explain about Korean war. One news explains that Korean war was occurred in 1950, Korean war was between South Korea and North Korea, and South Korea was democratic country and North Korea was communist country. In contrast, other news explains that why South Korea and North Korea fought, what is 38 parallel, and which countries supported South Korea and North Korea. Even though they explain same topic, they have different details. Therefore, someone who watches both of news can know more details.\n\nOn top of that, some news has mistakes. As watching different news, people can know what is true and what are mistakes. For example, a news which explains about Korean war made some mistakes that China supported South Korea while the war went. In fact, South Korea was supported by United States and North Korea was supported by China. People can know that information was mistake by watching other news.\n\nTo sum up, different news contains different details, and some news contains mistakes.

Others like to live in areas where the weather changes several times a year. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.', '" People live in a different climates all around the country. Some countries changes 4 times a year and other have a steady climate all year long. Although I agree with the fact that changing climates can have some advantages, steady climate is more practical for people to live in. The reasoning for this is that it cost less and people don''t have to worry about unexpected changes in weather.\n \nTo begin with, the expenses of living in a one climate country are much less. When the country have one climate, you don''t have to buy different kinds of clothes. In those countries who changes their climate, people have no choice but to buy winter outfits and summer outfits. For instance, when I lives in philliphines for a year, the weather was stiffling hot all year long. It took time to get use to the hot climate but I did not have to spend money on winter clothings. All in all, living in a country with only one weather condition can help you financially by not spending money on clothings.\n\nOn top of that, the weather condition is stable so they don''t have to worry about the sudden changements. Nowadays, many conuntries which formerly had 4 seasons are slowly changing due to global warming. The weather is becoming more and more unexpectable and people are anxious about sudden changements. In countries who have one weather condition, they don''t have to worry about the changements because the weather will be always cold or hot. To illustrate this point, in Korea, there has been a lot of changes of weather the past few years. So in one climate country, people worry less.\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that it is more sensible to live in a country which has one climate.

Some people think that it is better to move from one place to another, while others do not. In my case, I believe that living in one place is better. There are several reasons that I could discuss to support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. First, living in one place is more efficient. Second,  it is more convenient.\n\nTo begin with, the most important reason for my feeling this way is living in one place is more efficient. Money is very important in our lives. If we live in one place all our life, we will spend less money. Take my family, for example. Our family saved a lot of money because we lived in one place. It only cost my family nothing to live in one place. In contrast, it cost over 2000 dollars for my friend''s family when they moved. This was because we didn''t need to pay moving expense. This result clearly shows that it is more efficient to live in one place.\n\nAlso, another reason which proves my point is that living one place is convenient. It is diificult to gain access to new house. Therefore, it can be said that it is worse to move from one place to another because it is too much of a hassle. This reminds me of a time when I started living on my own. It was very inconvenient to find a good apartment. Many apartments were too expensive or dangerous. Finally, I moved from Osaka city to Tokyo. On top of that, it was a hassle to acquire new geographic information of Tokyo city where I started living.
