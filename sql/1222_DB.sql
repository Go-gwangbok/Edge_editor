Why is the animal important?', '"Many animals like tiger, cow, dog, and cat have an importance in the various aspects like as keeping guard over night and cultivating the soil, not to mention keeping the ecosystem.  Despite that, if I should choose one animal among them, dogs are the most significant in my country, Korea in terms of emotional development of children and dogs’ faithfulness. \n\nFirst of all, dogs are really helpful for the emotional development of children. That is, in the recent Korean society, parents are too busy for their work to take care for children and finally likely to make children selfish and rarely realizing the importance of sincere attention toward others.  In the case that children spend time with dogs while parents are not with them, however, they learn the spirit to consider others from dogs with giving a love to them like feeding, washing, wearing them.  Actually, one survey reported that Korean children grow up to the generous and mild character after living with dogs.\n\nMoreover, dogs are faithful and give a lesson to many Korean people.  There is the famous saying in Korea like “The faithfulness of dogs is better than people.”  As this saying means, they are extremely subordinate to their master and even if they are thrown a few miles away, they desperately come back to their master even without eating anything.  Actually, one dog called as “Jin-do” is the representative dog of Korea, a symbol of faithfulness.  Therefore, dogs’ unchangeable love and trust to their master give many Koreans to a meaningful lesson like as the trust among people. \n\nAccordingly, dogs are considered as the most important animal in Korea.  Than any other animal, they more contribute to the formation of the good character like considering others and the demonstrator for the faithfulness among people."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? "', '"There is a saying ""Nothing outlives book."" Since the creation of letters, people have started to record mysterious happenings, marvelous things, religious beliefs, historical events etc., in books. In this vantage point, books are not but  sums of human knowledge gained and experienced by people from ancient times to these days. However, knowledge and experiences in books have been ceaselessly refined and finally lost its crudity. As a result, knowledge gained from books are likely to be more abstract and indirect than knowledge gained from experience. \n\n       When we learn something by experience, it means that we happen to get a lesson about it by using our own body and soul. In contrast, when we learn something in books, it means we happen to know that by using only our brain. This is a great difference. For example, we can easily find books which say touching a burning pot could hurt you. However this kind of warning doesn''t make good effects because it is very abstract. On the contrary, if a person who happen to touch a burning pot by mistake, easily learns it is very dangerous to get closer to hot objects. Moreover he will memorize it for a long time. Therefore knowledge learned by experience is more realistic. \n\n       In addition, knowledge in books is apt to be biased. Knowledge and information in books are tend to reflect their writer''s point of view. It is not surprising to find various history books which witness the same historical event but show great different perspectives. Writers can deftly manipulate knowledge by hiding some or over-emphasizing a fact or another. This kind of cheating is easily overlooked by readers who are prone to believe that writers tell the truth. On the other hand, knowledge learned by experience is more direct. so there is no loophole for manipulation. For example, reports by press on damage or death toll for wars or disasters are often less precise than those by witness who experience the events in the place. \n\n       In my opinion, knowledge gained from books provide us basic and broad back ground information, But knowledge gained from experience give us more realistic and direct ideas for affairs. Therefore, I think knowledge learned by experience is more important and precious. Even though, knowledge in books seems to be better arranged and selected, we also have to listen carefully to vivid and living lessons of experience.

However, I think disadvantage affects to my town much more than advantage does in repect of pollution. \n     \n     \n     The main benefit of a new factory is obvious: increased jobs. During IMF, some TV program I was used to enjoying introduced one city experiencing some changes after a factory established in it. Before a factory entered, many of the heads of the families in the city were not able to get jobs because of ''System-Control'' of the government. So many families underwent financial straits, and mood at home was heavy. Some of patriarches tried to deal with their mind as drinking, and fights were often occur on the street or at home.

When we find life a bore, I will have a long vacation in that it give students the chance which they can have the board outlook on life by a long trip and the time to prepare for the tests of special purposes. \n\n\n      On the one hand, a long vacation give us the chance which we can have the board outlook on life by a long trip. Long vacation enables students to travel to a region far away from their towns. During an adolescent period, taking a long trip is very useful. Through that, they can learn the wisdom of life as well as the wide knowledge that they could not learn in classes. For example, I traveled to Austrailia and worked as volunteer in  ATCV(Austrailia Trust Conservation Volunteer) for two months by using my first university summer vacation. Through the trip, I learned not only the world view  but also the importance of the nature by experiencing ATCV in Austrailia. Therefore by providing the chance to have a long trip, they can widen their outlook on life. \n\n     On the other hand, a long vacation could be used as the time to prepare for the tests of special purposes. As you see, there are some tests needing long preparation times for special purposes such as foreign language ability and professional technique. However, if the time to be given were so short for preparing the test,  they cannot concentrate on the test and the possibility which they can pass the test could be smaller.

But from once upon a time, we have read fiction such as detective novel, science novel . There is no reason to restrict our reading to nonfiction such as real events, real people, and established facts.

Because some sort of fiction make an effect on our dream, we dream of pilot,  president, a detective , scientist and so on.  As you see, the imagination play an important role as motive power which our dream come true.

To illustrate, while I worked hard in graduate school due to a heavy burden of a national research project, I am in bad condition both mentally and physically, even while a mere trifle irritate me. I start to read novel “The Lord Of The rings” for a solution to get rid of my problem. It results in a good success. Even though tough research project and tight schedule, I can have a tranquil heart without stresses. Under mental stresses, sitting on the bench, let’s read an exciting novel, and then you feel free, comfortable. \n\nIn sum up, for the above-mentioned reasons, I support the idea that reading a fiction is beneficial for enhancing the power of the imagination and a good rest and the removal of our stresses.

But as the time goes on and on, Viewpoint of the education is changing. Now, we can say and I agree with the above statement , ”Schools should ask students evaluate their teachers.” In that evaluating their teachers improve their skills and the quality of the education through the competition and is a good way for school administrators to evaluate teachers efficiently. \n\n\n     In the first place , evaluating teachers improve their skills and the ability of the education through the competition. As you see, the profession like teacher is stable and there is few possibility to be dismissed , on the other hand they are apt to fall in the period of a lassitude. Because teachers also are human being, they could get lazy and difficult to control their first minds, back to basics.

Finally, without being restricted from leftovers of  Confucianism and thinking twice, the introduction of  the system of evaluating teachers is beneficial to rational education to enhance their skills and quality of the education through the competition. \n\n     In the second place, it is a good way for school administrators to evaluate teachers efficiently. When the school administrators evaluate the achievement of teachers, so many factors are included to it. In my thinking, one of the most important factors is whether students are satisfied with the lecture of the teachers, which show us the ability and the quality of the teachers.

What''s more, parents give us love and affection that is indispensible for us to make good relation with others. \n\nFirst, as is mentioned above, there is no teacher who knows children better than parents.

Although it is difficult for parents to give their children specific knowledge, information or skill, the very fact that parents know their children very well make them the best teachers. For example, teachers have no way to find out what their students need before students ask teachers what they want or need, because there are many students and few teachers. In addition, teachers can not spend most of their time in taking care of just one student. On the contrary, parents can spend relatively much time to their children.

Without personal affection to certain students, keeping touch with them is not as easy as we think. On the contrary, parents, the best teacher who love their students keep in touching with children with great concern before they die. \n\nIn sum, it is not easy for us to conclude that parents are the best teacher because they can not teach us proffesional knowledge.

For example, our university library already has a wide variety of books, but most books only contain out-of-date information. Thus, students without computers hardly catch up with up-to-date technologies. Of course, students can ask a librarian to apply some books, which students need, but the process is mostly complex and time-consuming. However, if students can use a computer, these inconvenient things would be solved by computers, because students using computers can easily connect a school network system and Internet, and they can easily find information, which they need. \n\n        Secondly, students who work with computers can process much information in real time. For instance, if you want to find some books without computers in the library, you would spend a lot of time to find an index card, and to know that the book is still there or lended.  Maybe to find a book would take at least ten minutes without help of the computer. However, if you use a computer, you can direct search the book that you need, and you can get the book in no time. Of course, if you use Internet, you can also find a wide variety of information such as research papers, latest articles, and news in no time.

Therefore, I am for the statement that people need to read both fiction and non-fiction for a couple of reasons.

My brother, who majors in shipbuilding technology at the moment, dreamed about becoming a good scientist when he was very young with reading various kinds of scientific novels.

In most case, if a certain local government is not in good cultural or economic state, the government tend not to invest on such faculties such as museum.

This miracle was come from perspiration of all people in Korea, especially the laborer who worked at the factory paying low-wage and poor environment. As economy grows rapidly, people concern about whether Korea can become more affluent or not. In Korea’s circumstance where natural resources are limited, talented people need to be trained. With part of that worries, some people urge to use English as an official language. It is inevitable to Korea to survive from globalization which accelerates competitiveness among the nations.

I realized that the older we are , the more difficult we get a money from parents. Even if I have money to go chow hall, I have tried to keep the money in bank for my future. When we eat food at home, It’s possible to store food that we left. It’s a common sense that most of restaurants have dumped the food away right after customers set off from restaurants. It not only made environmental problems, but also raised the food price. I saw one article in newspaper that government and private companies spent two billion won to recover the environment. I also want to mention about tip culture. It’s recommended to leave 10~15% of your whole food price on the desk, when you leave the restaurant. If the waiter impressively served to you, you would like to leave more money than regular tips. \n\n  Secondly, eating at home is more safe than restaurant, or food stall.

Part time job members usually didn’t  wash their hands when they start working and didn’t use a plastic glove.  A  worker said that a host just always has pushed him to work quickly and didn’t say anything about safty of making food.

Some people maintain that this behavior don’t affect friendship.

For example, I am a university student and I earned money by doing part-time job to afford my tuition. In this case, I always have trouble in my financial statement.

So I wanted to say what some of the quialities of a good parent are. I think good parents have to show their passion about what they are doing, generosity and they have not to make an unhappy family. Let me tell you specifically about them. \n\n     One of the features of the good parent is that they show that they are doing their best whatever they do. It is really important. From a baby to adult, children see his parents during his life. As growing, children are realizing what they should do from their environment. One of the most important things which effect them is of course his father and mother. If his father shows that his best and passion about something. It will effect his sons and daughters as good advantages. \n\n    Another point I think is that usually good parents are very generous. If father shows mercy for the poor, children will learn how to mercy someone. If he shows just his passion about something, his sons and daughters will learn just a passion from his father and mother not generosity. It means it is possible children will be selfish. \n\n    The last point I think is that the good parents don’t make unhappy for their family. Economical capablity is also important and their personality is also important. However, I think the most important thing is that good parent make their family very happy. Some good parents never fight in front of children. It is sure that they are trying to make a happy family. Usually a guy who does criminal is from an unhappy family. When parents fight each other, statistics shows children suffer a lot of stress. It makes them to go out of the houses. \n\n     To be a good parent, they should make happy family. To be a good parent, they have to show their passion to their children. Itself will be a good education. To be a good parent, they should teach what generosity is to prevent their children from being selfish. What are more important? I think that these are the most important things to be a good parent. I don’t mean there aren’t other important things. But I believe when a good parent shows these for their children,  their children will grow happily and learn how to live will in a society. \n\n"', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

To be specific, if the teacher gives a lecture about some social issues or literatures adding his or her own political meaning, the students are likely to accept academics in a biased position. From my persnoal experience, my history teacher in high school usually taught us a few important historic events from the progressive viewpoints. Because of this, we used to think that our society should be drastically changed in most fields without rational reasons. In this regard, teaching with political stances would have a negative impact on the growth of the youth''s mind.\n \nAnother equally important reason is that the student is very susceptible to teacher''s thoughts. To elaborate, the students who are not mature enough to judge social or political phenomenon tend to follow teacher''s opinion blindly, which can be an obstacle to the development of democracy in our state. According to a study conducted on the politics of adult by the Korea University, it has been reported that nearly 55% of the adults who are now a member of political parties responded that their politics have been significantly influenced by the teacher''s political view in classes. As can be seen, it is obvious that teacher''s social or political thoughts could affect students.\n \nTo wap it up, admittedly teachers have the rights to hold and mention their opinion on social or political things. However, looking at all statements above, if in the classroom, it is undeniable that its negative effects outweigh the favorable outcome of it."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

It is because people can get rid of stress when they watch TV. However, I believe that reading books is a more fulfilling hobby for two reasons. First, people can broaden their views. Second, reading books improves work efficiency.\n \nFirst of all, reading books can allow people to broaden their horizon. By reading a lot of books, they can learn about different worlds of lifestyles, basic customs and cultures. It is obvious that they may go through trial and error. However, they can learn to embrace diversity through this experience. For example, when I had a part-time job, there was an Ethiopian girl who brought home-cooked meals for lunch. She ate with her hands without using utensils, and other students who had never seen such a scene kept their distances from her. On the other hand, being educated on Africa and African table manners through various books, I was perfectly understanding and comfortable with what was taking place.\n \nIn addition, reading books can encourage people to work with more passion. This is attributed the fact that it can serve as one of the key motivators for them to perform better and to improve themselves. With such motivation, they put in more effort, concentrate better on their tasks, and feel a greater sense of responsibility for their work. According to a research conducted by the Ministry of Labor in 2009, there was a huge difference between two groups of employees in relation to their achievement.

The researchers showed that the former group spent 25% more number of hours on working and performed higher than the latter group. In particular, the employees in Group A followed instructions, submitted assignments on time, and participated actively in group meetings. On the other hand, those in Group B dozed off and lacked focus while working. It can be inferred that reading books frequently has a direct correlation with the amount of effort and energy that employees invest in working.\n \nAll in all, the importance of my view cannot be underestimated by the fact that it can kill two birds with one stone for the reasons I have mentioned above."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

One research revealed that students who worked out regularly had much better academic performance by 20% than those students who didn''t. The study further explained that physical activities lubricates the brain to function in perfect condition, making it in perfect condition to study better. This is why universities should not underestimate the effect of investing money on sports activities. Therefore, universities should provide proper environment for students to exercise on regular basis by putting much money and effort on sports.\n\nNot only sports activities promote physical condition which eventually affect positively on academic performance, it also triggers healthy interaction between students. Most sports games such as soccer and football are designed to play in group. Thus, while playing with many people, students naturally interact with each other and easily make friends.

Due to the decreasing number of newborn babies, a big portion of Korea’s citizens is aged 65 and older. This matter can damage our economy badly because the country should invest a lot of money on taking care of retired seniors. Also, since there aren’t enough babies being given birth, Korea cannot raise new workers of the future. Isn’t there any way we can escape from this situation?\n \n The first thing we can do to solve problems related to the low birth rate is to encourage mothers and fathers to give birth to more children. The biggest reason why parents aren’t having children is because of the amount of money they should spend to raise them. (education fees, money to buy their clothes, etc.) The money spent to raise a child is impossible to be calculated, and parents are concerned if they would face hardships in managing their budgets. In this situation, the government can support them in spending money for their kids. Currently, the government of the Republic of Korea is funding fees spent for a third child in a family. Our country needs to come up with more ideas like this one in order to attract mothers to help increase the birth rate.\n \n The second solution is to let citizens know more about the seriousness of the decreasing birth rate. A lot of parents in Korea aren’t aware of the reasons why low birth rate is such a serious crisis. They don’t know that when a big number of citizens become 65 and older, our nation’s economic growth can slow down because we cannot raise enough workers for companies, and the government needs to spend a big part of people’s taxes for healthcare and retirement life of seniors. In this situation, we can write more news articles and books about the birth rate issue. Then, people who read these would be able to learn how serious the problem is.\n \n Low birth rate is a serious problem in our nation these days, and we have to come up with solutions to it. We can encourage parents to have more children, and write books and show news broadcasts about the issue in order to let the public realize that it is a huge matter. Personally, I think one of the reasons why it is hard to increase the birth rate is because not every citizen of our country is participating in coming up with solutions.

It is well-known fact that children have tendency to imitate adults’ behavior. It is also applicable truth when they watch TV programs or movies. Especially, many TV programs and movies star celebrities which young people idolize. If such video images contain morally vague concepts, it would affect the youth negatively due to their tendency to emulate role models. Furthermore, the young tends to be less concrete about their morality, not knowing what is good or bad, and have vulnerable mentality. In this case, exposing them to morally ambiguous images damage their morality severely.\n \nOn top of that, these morally ambiguous images, which bad people get rewarded and good people get punished for example, would not only affect the young but also provoke adults.

This is one of the reasons why people are investing a huge amount of money on outer space exploration.

Since they are too worried to face the future, people are in search for planets we can move to. However, it is very difficult to find our ideal planet. Until now, scientists weren’t able to find an appropriate planet for humans. Nearly every planet they discovered lacked water and air. Also, even though they have found an alternative home for people, it would take countless light years for us to get there. Instead of spending time and money on looking for a new planet, it would be easier to engage more in bringing our nature back to its original condition.\n \n Moreover, it is easier to find new resources on Earth than in outer space. Many people agree that one of the reasons why people are investing a lot of money on space exploration is because they want to find new materials there. Since we lack coals and other natural resources, a lot of countries think that they would be able to find alternative energies easily off Earth. However, I disagree with this.

As far as I am concerned, I am in complete agreement with the argument. The two ideas stated below can be sufficient evidence to support my agreement.\n\nTo begin with, students have to take physical activities, such as basketball, football and tennis. This is because these sports can be revitalizing, offering an effective outlet for releasing stress and tension. As society becomes more complex and faster changing, students are increasingly tied up by heavy workloads including lectures, assignments and group studies. The result is frustration, as we feel pressure to handle tons of work. Because taking exercise is a refreshing activity, however, it can help students relieve their tension and stress. In this context, spending time on sports is a great way to relax. For example, when I was in college, I discussed same topic with my professor and friends, and they agreed that working out at the gym for a while and trying to relax are very good way to make balance between work and life. Even if it is only for a brief moment, they also mentioned that we can feel deeply composed and successfully gain some distance from out stress ridden daily routine. With these advices, I started to take jogging and hiking regularly, and I have felt energized and ready for another day of struggle with hustle and bustle of life. This is the reason why I strongly recommend for universities to invest more budgets on sports.\n\nOn top of that, doing sports for relaxation is useful in that it encourages people to have stronger ties with others around them. In todays'' competitive society, we are under great pressure to outpace others, and thus lack time to be with our friends. As a result, we are less emotionally attached to our colleagues than we were in the past. By doing physical activities together and sharing our fun, however, we can sustain solid relationship with other people as well as friends. Therefore, the value of physical activities for relaxation should not be overlooked. This the real value of sports that libraries cannot provide for students. According to a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly 80% of students replied that they could restore their bonds with colleagues through sports. This survey also shows that these 80% could exchange ideas and develop sympathetic bonds while doing exercise together. This increases emotional attachment and, by extension, social awareness.\n\nTo sum up, because of the reasons mentioned above, I firmly believed that putting as much money on sports as on libraries by universities should not only be allowed, but encouraged.

Nevertheless, I think disadvantages of TV overpower its favorable function especially lack of communication among friends and family.\n \nFirst of all, TV attracts every attention toward its programs, so it can interrupt communication while watching them. There might be someone who resists admitting and saying they can perform activities perfectly while watching TV such as having meals and speaking on the phone.

People can talk over and over while watching TV, but usually topics of conversation might end up all TV-related. Fortunately non-TV related conversation has started it is hard to get it off one’s chest while watching it.\n \nLast but not least, TV kills time without meaning, so precious time with people who you love is wasted. In modern society, people are extremely busy and they have limited span of time to be with their family or friends. But we generously allow our time to watch TV. What a waste?  I have experienced the same. I flipped through the channel with the remote and spent meaning less time with my family and finally went to bed without talking much.

I was getting encouraged about learning. Finally, I got an score qualified for applying to the college.\n\nThe second reason is that Grades can show us our current abilities about how are we understanding about what we are learning.

For fast development, competition is very effective method especially to the company. In capitalization society, people should compete with their coworkers, other company and other countries.

Therefore, I think too much competition make this world really stressful and depressed.\n\n Secondly, the weakness of family bond makes people really unhappy. People are social animals and they live with their lovely family. The familiarity of family members plays very important role in our happy lives. However, in this fast changing society, family is breaking rapidly. According to the research of the Seoul University, the divorce rate increased fifty percent compared to the last 1990s. This research shows us that so many couples broke up and so did the family. In the past, only few couples got divorced easily. Increasing divorce rate also means that many children are living in one parent family. In this environment, children can not grow well.

Therefore, I disagree with the statement that students can learn from on-line.\n\nFirst and foremost, the internet provides too much information. This means that it contains invalid and incorrect information which could mislead students. When students are faced with invalid information, it is highly like that they cannot distinguish it from other reliable information but just accept it. For example, when I was high school student, I relied on the internet to finish my literature homework. I decided to log in one literature forum and ask some question related to Korean poetry in 20th century. I believed that people in the literature forum knows about questions that I asked. However, I realized that answers from the internet were absurd in some parts. Now, I can see that not every person in that forum was good at literature. I believe that their fragmented information hampered my learning at that time. As seen from this compelling example, students can gather unconvincing information from the internet and that information could disrupt effective learning.\n\nSecondly, students could not be inculcated with the way to think by themselves because the internet provides answers within a few seconds without providing room for thinking. In other words, students could not rear the ability of abstract thinking and inference which is essential for the effective learning. This idea was reflected on the recent study conducted by 100 teenage students. A group of students who do not use the internet for their study got high scores in an inference ability test whereas the other group of students who use the internet got relatively low scores. Therefore, the internet could not help the real learning because it cannot offer chances of making one’s own thought.\n\nIn conclusion, using the internet is not helpful for student’s learning.

In that when people do dangerous tasks, they are likely to hurt or lost their lives; when they do boring work, they tend to be lethargic, technologies have strongly helped people to become happier. For example, in the past, when people needed to make tunnels, workers had to do perilous tasks including breaking stones with tools in person and conveying them. Through the processes, many people got hurt and dead because of unfortunate accidents. According to the record which is calculated by the Ministry of Labor of Korea, in 1950s, the number of workers who dead in tunnel construction sites was about 3,500. Compared to that, at present, there are much fewer people lost their lives while doing construction work. This is absolutely because construction technologies have advanced. In other words, technology saved lives of a lot of people. In that anyone''s life is directly concerned with other''s happiness, science technologies have improved our lives.\n \n  Also, science technology let us communicate each other much better. The Internet and cell phone have been widely spread throughout the world. Since such devices allow us to communicate each other very easily and fast, even though we live far apart each other, we can make conversation as frequently as they live near our houses.

This increase has occurred more sharply when the Internet appeared, and until now, the rise has continued. In that the fact proven by various psychology experiments that true happiness comes from interaction with other people, no doubt, technology has contributed to happiness of people.\n \nIn short, by employing science technologies, people come to be significantly free from risky tasks, as we can see the decreased number of deaths of construction workers. Moreover, development of telecommunication has allowed us to make conversation easily which will also help us to make deep relationships.

When a child is born, psychologists claim that his or her mind is like a ""blank slate"" meaning that a child''s personality is not yet determined at birth. Thus a child develops own temperament as he grows up. Therefore, what a child sees, hears, and feels in childhood all add up to become one''s personality. Consequently, a child''s youth is important because it is the time when a child''s personality is determined.\n\nSecondly, children absorb knowledge faster than any other time in their life. Thus children should constantly be exposed to new information during childhood years. The capability of children to learn about new knowledge cannot be compared to that of adults''. For instance, when a child is sent to another country, he picks up the language very fast and naturally assimilate into the new culture. On the other side, adults are slower at learning a new language and a culture. Scientists explain that a child''s brain is like a sponge as it absorbs new information very fast. Thus it is the reason scientists emphasize on the importance of education at an early age.

As far as I am concerned, I am in complete agreement with the argument. The two ideas stated below can be sufficient evidence to support my agreement.\n\nTo begin with, students have to take physical activities, such as basketball, football and tennis. This is because these sports can be revitalizing, offering an effective outlet for releasing stress and tension. As society becomes more complex and faster changing, students are increasingly tied up by heavy workloads including lectures, assignments and group studies. The result is frustration, as we feel pressure to handle tons of work. Because taking exercise is a refreshing activity, however, it can help students relieve their tension and stress. In this context, spending time on sports is a great way to relax. For example, when I was in college, I discussed the same topic with my professor and friends, and they agreed that working out at the gym for a while and trying to relax are very good way to make balance between work and life. Even if it is only for a brief moment, they also mentioned that we can feel deeply composed and successfully gain some distance from out stress ridden daily routine. With these advices, I started to take jogging and hiking regularly, and I have felt energized and ready for another day of struggle with hustle and bustle of life. This is the reason why I strongly recommend for universities to invest more budgets on sports.\n\nOn top of that, doing sports for relaxation is useful in that as it encourages people to have stronger ties with others around them. In todays'' competitive society, we are under great pressure to outpace others, and thus lack time to be with our friends. As a result, we are less emotionally attached to our colleagues than we were in the past. By doing physical activities together and sharing our fun, however, we can sustain solid relationship with other people as well as friends. Therefore, the value of physical activities for relaxation should not be overlooked. This is the real value of sports that libraries cannot provide for students. According to a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly 80% of students replied that they could restore their bonds with colleagues through sports. This survey also shows that these 80% could exchange ideas and develop sympathetic bonds while doing exercise together. This increases emotional attachment and, by extension, social awareness.\n\nTo sum up, because of the reasons mentioned above, I firmly believed that putting as much money on sports as on libraries by universities should not only be allowed, but encouraged.

It would be more influential and persuasive than opinions from others for them.\n\nTo begin with, the opinions of celebrities are influential, especially for young people. For these days, many celebrities try to communicate with their fans by using SNS(Social Network Service; for example, Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter). The major user of this service is young people. In addition, the characteristic of young users is fast forwarding, sharing speed. Thus, what celebrities say spreads fast. According to the result conducted by Korean National University, only one hour is required to spread some news into all 20’s in the world. On the other hand, three days are needed to spread same news into all 40’s in the world. In other words, lots of young people can be assimilated with what celebrities say.\n\nFurthermore, the opinions of celebrities are persuasive. Generally, the more people are young, the more likely to imagine of what they want to be. Hence, lots of youngsters follow celebrity trends. They even try to share emotions or feelings of celebrities. This is why young people are easily moved from what celebrities say. For example, until a Korean famous singer insists that pets be well-treated more than current condition, most people except who loves pets were indifferent about animal cruelties. After the singer’s opinion, lots of young people including their family members, relatives participated in the signature-collecting campaign for protecting abused pets.\n\nA strong word can change public opinion.

However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside because children can think more and children cannot control their parents.\n\nFirst of all, it is advantageous for children to grow up in the countryside rather than in a big city because children who live in countryside relatively do not affected by their parents, so they can think deeply. To illustrate my point, there was a boy who lives in rural area. He always gets along with animals such as sheep and cow. Later, he had broadened mind and better thinking. This is because by living animals, he always spent time for himself such as wrote daily schedule and practice instruments. Those can be cheer for him and bring about his personality largely. Due to these facts, there are no doubts that it is advantageous for children to grow up in the countryside.\n\nFurthermore, it is undeniable that it is better for kids to grow up in the countryside than in a big city because children who live in near the capital always repeat same schedule, so those works cannot develop children’s mind. In a recent research conducted by the Education Department of South Korea, it stated that 78.9% of elementary school students who live in Seoul were very busy daily lives. This is because their parents have proud with their kids, so many parents dominate their children such as teach varieties of education system. This is not an isolated incident, similar researches were conducted in many other Asian countries such as Japan and Taiwan and the results were for the same reasons. In this sense, it is undeniable that it is better for kids to grow up in the countryside than in a big city.\n\nTalking all of these into consideration, I strongly believe that it is beneficial for youngsters to grow up in the rural area rather than in a big city for the reasons I mentioned above."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

Nonetheless, I strongly suggest that government put environmental problems before health care because reduced environmental problems can mean less health care burden for government and a large portion of environmental problems cannot be treated individually whereas people can individually care for their own health.\n\nFirst of all, if government pay more attention to environmental concerns, health problems will naturally decrease. Environmental pollution is one of the leading factors of disease nowadays. Therefore, if government increase its investment in environmental protection and enforce stricter laws, it can consequently cut its budget for health care. For instance, if someone suffers lung cancer which is usually known to be caused by air pollution, this person will probably rely on government subsidies to receive expensive treatments. If government had paid more attention to regulate environmental pollution in the first place, government would not have had to spend a dime on this person. Consequently, government should pay more attention to environmental concerns as a long term solution to health problems.     \n\nSecondly, environmental issues cannot usually be handled individually while each person can look after own health. Environmental problems are global concerns which require the initiatives of government. For example, the deforestation in Amazon is causing severe global scale problems such global warming. However, there is a limit to what individuals can do to stop these without the help of  government. On the other side, health problems can be dealt individually by regularly exercising and maintaining healthy diet. There is nothing much government can do except for financially subsidizing patients. Having said all, government should prioritize environmental problems. \n\nIn conclusion, government should take environmental issues more seriously than health care because reducing environmental problems can be a solution to health problems and health care can be done individually.

However, in my opinion, there should be more emphasis on the big family in contemporary society. That is, children can improve their social skills from the youth in the extended family and people feel much happier and have more of sense of security.\n \nTo begin with, the extended family provides much better environment for children to develop their social skills. That is, from the very early age, children get to build relationships with different types of people including grandparents, uncles, aunties, and nephews. Such family members are belong to different age groups and each relationship is different and unique from each other. Therefore, children naturally learn how to communicate with the younger, older, male, or female, developing communication skills dealing with various types of people which they will encounter in the society. Such skills are essential part of life for children to live harmoniously. For example, my friend Min-young was born in the extended family which includes many family members. Her personality is always outgoing, very sociable and popular among friends. I believe such character of her comes from her background having extended family.\n \nOn top of that, people who grew up in extended family tend to be much happier and feel sense of security more than those people who grew up in the nuclear family. To elaborate, people who belong to the big family have surroundings which they can always get support from. If one is in difficult situation and experiencing hard times in life, he or she can discuss with family members. Since there are many family members who went through many things in life, one can get useful advices from them and overcome difficulties easily. Moreover, family members will not only support physically but also mentally. They will provide emotional support and assistance which would lead to sense of security and comfort. Such comfort is very important living in the stressful contemporary society. Therefore, it is understatement that extended family is less important now than in the past. It is as equally important now as it was in the past.\n \nTo wrap up, it is obvious that extended family is as crucial as in the past now because it offers better environment for children to improve social skills, and it provides sense of security and comfort to people.

Obviously, entertainers were one of those who actively put their opinions regarding controversial issues, and I believe that those famous people played a pretty important role in making the younger generations than older ones get interest in these issues.\n\nFirst of all, younger people pay attention to and care about the opinions and thoughts of celebrities than older generations. This can be seen among the teenagers most of the times, since teens tend to have a longing for certain celebrity they favor and idolize them; hence, feel curiosity towards the thoughts and perspectives he or she has and easily are influenced by these thoughts. For example, an entertainer brought up an issue about animal abuse, and left a sentence saying animals should be treated well since they are also living creatures that have feelings on her own homepage, with a photo she took with her pet dog together. This was noticed by many people who agreed with her view and took part in spreading it to more people, and most of them were teenagers and young people in their 20''s, who cared about this celebrity much.\n\nIn addition, younger generations are more familiar to using electronic devices and sharing ideas through them, which older people usually are not very interested in. With the drastic development of Informational Technology, younger people were born and grew up with electronic gadgets as more options were attached to them year by year, and ostensibly many celebrities who dominantly use SNS based on the Internet as a way to express their ideas are the young ones who consist this generation. As a result, younger people would look into celebrities'' opinions more and be much more exposed to opinions of celebrities than older ones who hardly get a chance to do this; and eventually, younger ones who frequently watched famous people''s views would be affected at least to some extent.\n\nTo sum up, with the drastic improvement in technology combined with usual attention of younger generations towards their objects of observation, famous, unreachable and respected people, it made the celebrities'' perspectives very influential to younger people.

While there are many good arguments for both positions, the following argument will explain in detail why I agree.\n\n  My first argument for the influence of people should be espoused. This is because people play critical roles in developing our untapped talents. Modern-day people live hectic lives because today''s globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. Consequently, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the fields of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for people to help us to develop our talents and tap into our full potential. Therefore, people'' influence cannot be overlooked in this context. According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people who are under the close guidance of their co-workers and boss at their workplace decide on their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not. The majority of education experts argued that people are likely to be unproductive if they do not fully receive the advice and help of their peers and boss, especially when they are in their potential stages.\n \n  Moreover, my strong support for people'' influence can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that people, with their years of experience, can offer lessons on morality and ethics. People who are not still mentally immature have long way to go before they become experts in their fields. During this long journey, they tend to make many mistakes and are prone to misbehave. However, people can be guided by their closer friends and mates, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms and can thus become good models for society. In this respect, people exert good influence on us. For example, undeveloped people may give in to the temptation of playing computer games all nights long because they are too immature to judge right from wrong. This is why people'' influence is an urgent need. With the guidance of them, such as co-workers or boss of us, we can learn how to avoid such temptations and become law-abiding citizens, by listening our advisers'' descriptions of their own experiences. Through such lessons, we can become holistic beings.\n\n  In a nut shell, my discussion above presents two stronger arguments for people'' influence which I believe effectively convince the reader."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

However, I firmly believe that even though it would be risky that destroy a relationship, people should take action for their friends for following reasons: First, one can''t make wise decision alone and second, it will worsen a friendship if something gets wrong with a friend.\n\nTo begin with, every human being is not perfect creature. Which means we always can''t make smart decision by ourselves in all situations. That is why a good friend exists. People should help their friends to do right thing when others seem to walk along the wrong path. For example, I have an old friend named Jihee. Since Jihee has always felt that she needs to study more, she decided to study abroad in United States after she graduated college. After getting in graduate school in California, everything seemed going well with her. However, one day I realized via her friend that she got addicted to alcohol because she could not get used to new life in strange country and had heavy pressure under the a lot of tests she had to pass. As one of closest friend, I was worrying about her situation. So I flew to her place and persuaded her to take off the school for a year and come back to hometown. At first, she refused to take my advice, but she soon went back to Korea with me and got some therapies for her alcohol addiction. If I had not taken any action for her situation, she would be in serious trouble by now. Therefore, it is important to guide friends into right direction rather than sitting back and watch them making wrong decisions.\n\nOn top of that, just letting a friend decide any choice can worsen relationship sometimes. If a friend''s decision get wrong and something bad happens to her, she may blame on me having not told any advice to her. Thus it would break our friendship. For example, when I was in high school, I used to have a friend Nancy. At that time Nancy was considering breaking up with her boyfriend because he would not respond her messages and calls for two weeks. Even though I saw that guy walking with a strange girl at the shopping mall, I didn''t give her any advice because it could hurt her feelings. Also I thought all matters were up to Nancy. However, after she realized the boy was cheating on her, Nancy suddenly blamed on me that I haven''t told anything I knew to her. After for a while, Nancy apologized to me about being dramatic, but we could not get along well as we used to. This example implies that sometimes letting a friend making own decisions is not good idea and may break a relationship.\n\nTo sum up, I agree with the idea that taking action that risks destroying a friendship Is better than letting a friend make a mistake. Since people usually can''t make smart decision alone, friends need to guide that right direction. Also, sometimes sitting back and allowing a friend decide whatever they want will worsen a friendship if something gets wrong with her."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

This is because people generally do not live with their extended family. Also, people in these days are too busy.\n\n \n\nTo begin with, it is not common that living with their extended family, or living close to their extended family today. Around two decades ago, it was common that living with or living close to a lot of family members including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and so on. However, as time goes by, the size of family has been decreased, and the frequency of meeting extended family has been decreased, too. This situation naturally discourages people communicate with their extended family. In a nutshell, it will be no difference between extended family and strangers in near future. Considering current trend, I believe that the importance of extended family is just an illusion.\n\nSecondly, nowadays, people live in a big competition. All the things related to their life belong to the matter of competitions. For example, teenagers compete their academic grades, a business man compete their companies. There is no enough time to looking how their family lives well or similar things. According to the research conducted by Korean University in 2010, eighty-percent of people talks with their extended family once a month. Furthermore, half of the people who are in the eighty-percent answered that they do not care about their extended family because of their tight life. This result shows the fact that people do not consider their extended family as cherish human beings in the world, contrast to the past tendency.\n\nTo sum up, family separation has brought less communication and indifference to the extended family. Struggle for hot competition in these days prevents people from paying attention to their family members, especially to the extended family members.

As a result, doing things slowly and making almost everything correctly seems to be sort of out of date. In a modern society, people should, I believe, work at a higher speed and risk taking mistakes.\n\nFirst of all, the development of modern technology has made our life faster than ever before. With the assistance of modern techniques, we consequently should work faster than ever before. For instance, in the old days people made their own clothes by hand. However, now machines in the factories have made sewing and weaving at a great speed and of great quality. We do not have waste any time doing cumbersome works because of the modern technology. Therefore, we should not insist to work at a slow pace instead of enjoying convenience that is brought by technology.\n\nAnother important aspect is, now we are living in a society which develops rapidly. To meet the rapid change and improvement, all of us need to improve our own efficiency. As we can see, almost every factory wants to increase its productivity and almost all the employers to generate greater value within the time limitation.

We can see surround people who are in stress because of losing money. Most of this happening exists due to the wrong management. For example, people sometimes invest their money without profound consideration. Another case, someone lend their money to their friends without official documents.

This is very important and time-consuming education while the result rarely appears to be good grades. The purpose of schools is not only in improving students'' intellectual ability, but also growing them as good members of society. Since we are living together having interactions, there is more possibility that success in life is up to one person''s character like responsibility, morality, not rely upon how much knowledge they have. For example, There is a hairdressor from Korea who succeed in Philippines as a boss of tens of shops. Actually, he was not a honor student because he didn''t like studying general subjects. However, he met a homeroom teacher when he was in middle school who always encouraged him to find his talent and emphasized and let know like growing leadership, time-management skill, and endurance are so important in life than winning good grades. He said that from the teacher, he got courage, got to know how to live an independant life, and he found his flair and decided to be a hairdressor. Even he said that his enterprise at present would not exist if she did not encouraged him. In this sense, we can know teachers'' education much affect one''s life,and this is not knowlege, but wisdom. Wisdom does rarely appear as students'' grades, but it is essential for teachers to teach. When teachers are evaulated and paid only with their teaching skill, they are more likely to spend less time how they can make their students wiser and good members of society. Thus, I strongly believe that teaching skill cannot be a standard how much they get paid.\n \n Also, the relationship between students and teachers would more likely to be superficial. This is because students would think that the reason teachers spend long time how to teach effectively is only for his or her better finance, not from love for students. There is believe that educators are the people who educate students to cultivate good social being, so pupils respect their teachers since they feel teachers love their being although they get salaries. If such policy come to be true, they would regard the teachers who put a lot of efforts into class just instructors, and pupils would not also realize the true heart of educators to enhance their intellectual ability which let them live with widen perspectives. According to a survey conducted by psychology department of Chicago university, There was huge difference between two groups: A group of schools enacted the salary policy based on students'' performances, and B group did not. The students of the schools of A group tended not to follow educators'' advice, and the rate of the juvenile delinquent was higher about 30 percent more. Moreover, they were thinking teachers only educate for their financial condition, and they are not loved by them. In this sense, how well teach students should not be a criteion for educators'' salaries.\n \n In short, if educators get paid based on students'' peformances, for their high salaries, they would not spend enough time making students suitable members of society, and students would not appreciate their teachers'' endeavor to develop teaching skill because they would think their effort is for money, not for love for pupils.

This is because they help students to be well-balanced. While students grow up, they are exposed to certain types of the information and knowledge about the world, through education at school as well as at home. The problem with this is that most of information and knowledge is conveyed from one source''s particular viewpoint. Given this, in order to be well-informed, students try to learn about different viewpoints through their teachers'' personal views on politics. In my case, I acquired information about exploring space by chatting with my friends. Due to the friends, I came to be fully exposed to the great achievements of governmental space projects. However, my perspectives on these governmental projects could not be solely positive when I knew the difficulty of exploring space and frequent struggles with political parties involved through my teacher''s views on politics in the classroom. Without these political view points, I might have held a slanted view of what was going around me.\n\nMoreover, my strong support for teachers'' private ideas on politics can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that they can allow students to get the latest information. Our world is evolving at a surprising speed. As a result, students may have difficulty understanding all of the changes and new events come about. Given this context, it is important that they try to keep current by learning about changes and events through their teachers'' personal views on politics. In a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly two thirds of surveyed students felt that they could update their knowledge and successfully adjust themselves to the changing social trends through different views on politics by their teachers in the classroom. According to the surveyed students, these personal political views prevented them from being confined to an outdated world. It is no surprise that there has recently been a drastic increase in the number of students who love to hear their teachers'' personal views on politics to gain the latest knowledge of the world.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that students can become well-rounded by accepting their teachers'' personal views on politics in the classroom.

Some might argue that being same with other people is better. However, in my view, it is better to be different from others for success. There are several reasons that I could support my argument so I will limit the discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. First, people can save money. Also, people can get expertise.\n\nTo begin with, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people can save money. Most often, money tends to be very important in our everyday lives. If people are different from others, they will make the most of their money. Take my uncle, for example. It is very efficient to be different from others. My uncle did not waste money for drinking when he was in college. In contrast, his friends were drinking every week like other people. Thus, they spent much money when they were college student. Unlike his friends, my uncle did not spend money for drinking for 7 years and made their own restaurant by using that money. This result clearly shows that being different from others help people become successful because of efficiency.\n\nMoreover, another reason which proves my point is that people can get expertise. Commonly in society, many accomplished people tend to have expertise. Therefore, people can succeed if they are different from others because it help them get expertise. A really good example can be seen in Minhan Kim. I read online that Kim, the CEO of the CS company, achieved great success because he was different from others. Kim, using this expertise, transformed his company one of the most profitable software enterprises in Korea. When he was high school student, he did not study to go to university like other students in Korea. He did not go to university, but made programs on and on. As a result, he made a great program and earned prestige. This example clearly shows that it is better to be different from others because of expertise.\n\nTo summarize, I believe that being different from others is helpful for achieving success on the grounds that people can save money and also people can get expertise."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

I strongly believe that someone who wants to be a great boss should have diligence, confidence and warm heart. These three traits are the most necessary components for a good supervisor.\n \nTo begin with, diligence is the most significant thing among many other qualities because there would be no success if someone is very lazy. There is a proverb that ""Early bird catches bugs"". Likewise, it is the most fundamental quality for supervisor who manages many people under his or her hand. If a company have an idle boss, it would ruin very quickly. For example, there was a chairman of some company, he always drank every night and did not care any tasks of the company. Eventually, he got fired because his subordinates completely hated him.\n \nAlso, confidence is substantial trait of a good supervisor''s requirement. Generally, a supervisor manages a lot of subordinates under his feet. To lead many people''s opinion, the leader should have great leadership that never sway by other assertions. If he would not decide his will or would not gather other people''s diverse arguments, the company''s policy would face a lot of problems. For instance, when I was a chairman of the committee at my work, I did not make a crucial decision due to some subordinate''s opposition. However, that hesitation resulted in a bigger confusion.\n \nIn addition, a warm-hearted mind is needed to someone who would like to be a great supervisor. This characteristic can obtain much better respect from subordinates. In all likelihood, no one would not like the supervisor who has a nice manner and is very kind. It is said that someone gives a goodwill to others, he will return it as much as he was given. Therefore, if someone utterly wants to be a great boss, he should have a thoughtful mind to others.\n\nTo conclude, there are some indispensable elements to be a good advisor. they are diligence, confidence and warm heart.

That’s because it is more easier to enjoy free time and there are lots of recreations that one person can enjoy.\n\nFirst, If people have a pastime alone, they do not need to be careful about other things. Specifically, playing with friends require to arrange meeting time, places and what they will do. This is possible to cause additional stress for an individual because it is time-consuming and hard to reconcile the options. For example, I have always loved to go hiking in mountains, and if I go there with someone, I would feel uncomfortable since I should consider the routes and how much we will walk. However, when I go hiking alone, I don’t need to worry about specific plans. I am able to choose courses to which I am attracted. In this regard, I believe that spending leisure time alone allows people to enjoy more easily.\n\nSecond, nowadays, people don''t need to find friends purposely to be recharged. It was fairly common for people in the past to have their free time with others, as going to beach or playing group sports. On the other hand, in today’s society, there are numerous entertainment every person can enjoy without gathering other people. For example, my father used to play soccer after school because it is hard to find a variety of pleasures in his town. He virtually did not have choice but to play physical activities. In contrast, in modern society, people have made various pastimes such as computer games, watching shows and doing something through smart phones. These are sometimes more interesting and don''t require other person. This is why I don''t think that group activities is necessary to relieve stress.\n\nTo sum up, enjoying pastimes alone is more better in some ways because people can arrange their time comfortably and there are many enjoyments that only a single person can enjoy."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

However, in my opinion, working three days a week for long hours is better for following reasons: We can relieve our stress by enjoying a hobby or having a journey.\n \nFor the primary reason, people can enjoy their hobby with enough time. Enjoying own hobby has an influence on psychological happiness. Thus, having a hobby is the best for spending holidays. However, there are things to do during holidays such as home chores, meeting friends. It is not easy to make time for enjoying own hobby. For example, in my country, people generally work for five days a week. It is rare to find people who enjoy their hobby within the two other days because most of the people think these holidays fly easily, just for taking a rest or having time with their family. Of course some might say working five days a week for short hours can use their after-working time, which is relatively longer than working three days a week, but it is not easy to manage after-working time as they think due to getting tired. Enjoying own hobby has an influence on psychological happiness Therefore, I prefer to working three days a week for long hours.\n \nMy next reason for supporting working three days a week for long hours is because workers can go travel during their holidays. Travel allows people not only to stress out, but also to increase productivity. To be specific, through travelling, people can enjoy their life at a distance. Seeing a wonderful landscape and eating a delicious food will give a sound body with a sound mind. They will be ready for getting back to work place with good condition. Good condition will bring a strong passion and enthusiasm. They will work hard even they have to work for long hours, and this will affect their future promotion. Following this repertory, people will be full of positive mind and praise their life. This is my reason why working three days a week is good.\n \nTo sum up, working three days a week for long hours is better option than the other because this option enables workers to manage their time easily. Making/enjoying a hobby or going travel really works for stress-out and this allows people to fall in love with their happy life, even their jobs."', '2013-12-13 13:14:46', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

However, I am of believer of the opposite is true. To elaborate, TV programs nowadays contain inappropriate contents and it is addictive in a way that it prevents the young to have healthier activities outdoor.\n \nTo begin with, visual images on TV in recent years display quite violent and inappropriate images for the youth to watch. The problem here is that these images will have negative effect on teenagers and adolescents because their mind is not as concrete as those of adults and they are vulnerable to these images in a way that it will affect their future behavior. To illustrate, one research done by Seoul National University of South Korea, those teenagers who watched violent images such as gunshots or fistfights showed 80% higher tendency to display violent act than those who did not. Therefore, TV programs today which depict much of these images will have definite negative effect on the youth.\n \nAnother equally important reason is that watching TV can be addictive so that it prevents teenagers to have healthier outdoor activities. TV programs are becoming bolder and bolder in its way of expression to attract more viewers. That is, they try to capture people’s eyes constantly to keep them in front of TV. Such despicable effort will lure young people to watch TV for all day long, resulting in unhealthy habit sitting face-to-face with TV screen every day.

To elaborate, the youth would spend their time pursuing excitements such as drinking, clubbing, or active sports such as football, tennis or soccer. In contrary, older people pursue peaceful and relaxing leisure such as reading in café, playing poker games, or just a simple walk during on a warm day. Such activities are enough for the old people to enjoy. For example, when I went to Bali, Indonesia, there were many retired elderly who visited. They were having time of their lives enjoying beach walk, having good conversation in cafes, and reading while sunbathing. In this regard, I do not think that the young will have more fun than the old.\n \nOn top of that, since old people are more experienced and satisfied, they can enjoy more comfortably. To illustrate, most of the elderly underwent many things so they know what they want. They probably tried many leisure activities and know exactly which activities they themselves enjoy or not. Therefore, there is no waste of time or money to discover which is good for them. Moreover, most of them have already achieved their goal or dream, so they are more satisfied with their life than the young.

Personally, the latter opinion seems much more persuasive for development of cars and economical reasons. \n\nTo begin with, in twenty years, every person can buy the cars because of their cheap prices. This is primarily due to the fact that development of alternative energy such as hydrogen, sunshine power and water. To be specific, these new cheap energy will replace expensive fossil fuel energy. Actually, the cost of using car is highly expensive because of the continually increasing cost of fuel; therefore, cheaper fuel would lead to increasing consumption of cars. A research on fuel was carried out at Seoul University. According to the study, 78 percent of 20s people would buy their future cars if the fuel is cheaper. This result clearly shows that in twenty years many people will afford to buy their cars.\n\nSecondly, car is the most convenient transportation and it will be same in twenty years either. To illustrate further, although developed technology made airplanes, we do not use airplane in our daily lives. This shows that driving car is the best for our routine lives. In twenty years, there might be a new fascinating transportation; however, using car will be the most suitable method to go near places.

There are two reasons: students are so young and susceptible to a teacher’s words that students can have biased view and imparting specific knowledge is educator’s primary duty.\n  \nFirst, teacher’s remarks about sensitive issues are very influential to their students, so they would be likely to grow concept that is similar to their teacher’s idea. It is evident that if one teacher supports one particular party or one-sided position, it definitely leads students to take a stance analogous to teacher’s thoughts.

One teacher explained the Iraq War as a way to attain world peace, while the other one portrayed the war caused by the invasion of the US to obtain Oil. Surprisingly, after each teacher finished their descriptions, students followed the positive or native view against the war at high rates.

However, we are living in peaceful and cohesive society nowadays, so most of countries are competing with each other by showing their athletic skill or their unique style of art. If government should support one between them, they should endorse the arts rather than supporting the athletics. Supporting arts is not only teaching lesson about history and culture, but also it could promote the tourism.\n \n First and foremost, tourism is crucial task for countries to show their traditions and efficient way to afford the money. Furthermore, arts could enhance the tourism by showing the greatest work from famous painter or writer from the past, so it could expedite the stride of countries’ economy.

Nonetheless, I strongly suggest that government put environmental problems before health care because reduced environmental problems can mean less health care burden for government and a large portion of environmental problems cannot be treated individually whereas people can individually care for their own health.\n \n First of all, if government pay more attention to environmental concerns, health problems will naturally decrease. Environmental pollution is one of the leading factors of disease nowadays. Therefore, if government increases its investment in environmental protection and enforces stricter laws, it can consequently cut its budget for health care.  For instance, if someone suffers lung cancer which is usually known to be caused by air pollution, this person will probably rely on government subsidies to receive expensive treatments. If government had paid more attention to regulating environmental pollution in the first place, government would not have had to spend a dime on this person. Consequently, government should pay more attention to environmental concerns as a long term solution to health problems. \n \nSecondly, environmental issues cannot usually be handled individually while each person can look after own health. Environmental problems are global concerns which require the initiatives of government. For example, the deforestation in Amazon is causing severe global scale problems such as global warming. However, there is a limit to what individuals can do to stop these without help of government. On the other side, health problems can be dealt individually by regularly exercising and maintaining healthy diet. There is nothing much government can do except for financially subsidizing patients.

This is because people play critical roles in developing our untapped talents. Modern-day people live hectic lives because today''s globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. Consequently, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the fields of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for people to help us to develop our talents and tap into our full potential. Therefore, people'' influence cannot be overlooked in this context.  According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people who are under the close guidance of their co-workers and boss at their workplace decide on their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not. The majority of education experts argued that people are likely to be unproductive if they do not fully receive the advice and help of their peers and boss, especially when they are in their potential stages. \n \nMoreover, my strong support for people'' influence can be rationalized.

However, people can be guided by their closer friends and mates, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms and can thus become good models for society. In this respect, people exert good influence on us. For example, undeveloped people may give in to the temptation of playing computer games allnight long because they are too immature to judge right from wrong. This is why others influence is an urgent need. With the guidance of people around us  such as co-workers or boss of us, we can learn how to avoid such temptations and become law-abiding citizens, by listening to our advisers'' descriptions of their own experiences.

As far as I am concerned, I am in complete disagreement with the argument. The two ideas can be sufficient evidence to support my disagreement.\n \nMy first argument for having excellent knowledge of a field for success in school or work should be espoused. This is because it helps us to be well-informed for success in school or work. While we grow up, we are exposed to certain types of the information and knowledge about the world, through education at work as well as at school. The problem with this is that most of the information and knowledge is conveyed from one source''s particular viewpoint. Given this, in order to be well-informed, we try to learn about different viewpoints from information through excellent knowledge of a field. In my case, I acquired information about space exploration by taking society class at university. Due to the class, I came to be fully exposed to the great achievements of governmental space projects. However, my perspectives on these governmental space projects could not be solely positive when I knew the difficulty of exploring space and huge budgets involved through doing my class assignments. Without these excellent knowledge of a field, I might have held a slanted view of what was going around me.\n \nMoreover, my strong support for broad knowledge of a field for success in school or work can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that it can allow us to get the latest information. Our world is evolving at a surprising speed. As a result, we may have difficulty understanding all of the changes and new events come about.

For example, when I was high school student I had to take assignment with a large encyclopedia or in a library. It took a long time and couldn’t give correct information. In addition, with limited time I couldn’t search enough information. However, the more developed is Internet, the easier is searching information and it can be used anytime and anywhere. As a result many students reduced their time and can search correct information.\n\nAnother reason, TV and radio can help students study easily. As broadcast is various and useful programs are established, we can increase chance indirect experience. In addition, as a professional program is made we can study with a small amount of money. For example, when I was elementary school I liked insect. However, I didn’t have chance to meet an insect because I lived in Seoul, metropolitan and capital of Korea. I often saw “World of insect” on TV and it filled my curiosity and was interesting. In addition, people in Seoul have very high concerns about education.

For instance, in a class, if a student needs more explanation about a easy problem, and if another student asks a more advanced problem, what will a teacher do? A teacher wants to teach all students'' curiosities, however, the time providing a teacher will not be infinite.

Personally, I agree to develop public transportation. When governments develop that, the air pollution of a city and rates of using natural resources are waned.

Especially, during rush hour, people aren''t hustled by others and don''t feel angry any more. Moreover, because of increasing public transportation, a city can earn more transportation fees than the past. So, a city makes an effort to develop citizens'' welfare and qualities of a city.

A computer becomes a thing of the past unless you keep upgrading them every 3 years or so. But books do not need to be upgraded. As a matter of fact, there are many novels that have been read from a hundred years ago and that are still being read – Tom Sawyer, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Homles. These books do not become a bunch of useless paper a few years later unlike computers which become heavy useless metal.\n\nSecond, schools do not need computers. Almost all the students have their own personal computers at home with better devices that they use all day after coming home from school. And they already use the computer very well without the school and teachers helping them. But students do not have enough books to read at home. So the school should provide what the students really need.\n\nLast of all, only one person can use one computer at a time and even that person cannot use the computer any longer than one class.  But if you use the money to buy twenty 5$ books instead of one 1000$ computer, a lot more people can use the information at the same time for as long as they want. As you can see, this is much more effective because you already have 600 books that everybody can use instead of 30 computers that only one person can use at a time and have to go in a couple of years.\n\nPeople say that students aren’t reading enough books nowadays. But this is partially the teachers’ and school’s fault because they were buying computers which has a life cycle of few years, which students already have at home, and which could have been 20 books per computer instead."', '2013-12-19 15:09:21', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

So I strongly believe that teachers are more good at teaching children.\n\nFirst, many parensts are not specialized on teaching someone else.

Watching it on TV was much better at that time. Therefore, I would rather buy the jewerly than go to the concert.\n\nIn short, If I have a money received from someone as a gift, I would buy the jewerley because I can use it when I have a financial difficulty.

Surprisingly, according to the statistics, there were some rich people, more than average, won the first prize. In other words, even though they were considered rich enough, they bought a lottery.

So unless they are judged objectively by the supervisor whom we work for, we cannot feel a sense of accomplishment and will not follow the orders from our boss. Then it will be evident that our work office or factory cannot get the progress because our effort and capability are not admitted well.\n\nSecond, a sense of responsibility is needed to a good boss. We, as a human, do not everything perfectly and may fail or make a mistake. At that time, a good supervisor should be able to hide our small faults and even take all responsibility for us. In doing so, we will trust him and can work better for him.\n\nFrom these two reasons, I feel that a good supervisor should have both objectiveness and a sense of responsibility in order to lead his followers well. From him, we can learn the valuable things which we should know to become a good business man, and our work will be enjoyable working with him. Furthermore, we will be able to be the ideal model as a good boss to our would-be followers in the future."', '2013-12-19 15:09:21', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay."', '"In the consequence of technical development, things have changed a lot. So as to this change, human-beings live longer than the past. Of course there are a lot of reasons, I think both the improvement of medical techniques and the nutritional diet tables cause this phenomenon. To illustrate why I convince my point, I will treat only a few significant reasons with my vivid experience as follows.\n\nAbove all, I want to point out break-though development in medical techniques. For example, according to a medical magazine, surveyed in 2003, human-beings'' median life span is 88 years old. This scrutiny shows the life span has increased more 20 years than the past. It causes the development in treatment for patient. Therefore, I am of the idea that improved medical techniques help this phenomenon.\n\n Another reason is eating habit. As human-being live in comfortable circumstance, they have concerned with the nutrition in foods. So, when people think of profusions, they often envision nutrition which these foods contain. And, they usually have habitual eating time for their health. In addition, they prefer to eat vegetables, rather than to eat meat. Because vegetables prevent fat, and enable people to clean their blood. In other words, to eat nutritious and balanced diet tables keep them more healthful. Thus I think balanced and nutritious diet tables help for people to live longer than the past.\n\nAll in all, I strongly think that human-beings live longer than the past. The reason why I think like this is not only because the medical techniques have improved, but also the diet tables have more nutritious than the past. Of course there are a lot of reasons to consider, I believe there is no substitution for afore-mentioned things."', '2013-12-19 15:09:21', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

However, some people say that higher education should be prepared for good student. In my opinion, college or university education should be open to all student in that education should be fair in any case and we could discover some talents we miss.\n\nFirst, education should be open to every student because everyone has the right to be educated. I think, if the society does not gives people who want to study the chance to be informed, it is not for the everyone. It could be said unfair society. For example, Choseun Dinasity, Korea 500 years ago, gives the right to be educated only to selected people, Yangban. However, there is no difference between selected people and non-selected people In fact. Although non-selected people had the right to be educated, people at that times didn''t know how important the right is. Consequently, Choseun Dinasity had fallen down slowly. Does the society at these days make that mistake, too? In this manner, though it sounds theoretically, because everyone has the right to be informed education should be given to every student.\n\nSecond, if we offer higher education to good student we can''t find the talents we omit. Some students who are proved ''not good'' could have some talents in other areas. For example, a friend of mine who couldn''t go to university because of her low grade in high school possesses the ability to draw something like people''s face and movement artically. Nevertheless, she was not admitted to study art more since she was not successful in mathematics and science. In this respect, I think higher education should be available to every student in that we can see the capacity which can be lament now.\n\nTo sum up, I think higher education should be offered to every student because of the right to be educated in modern society and the ability we could miss.

One survey on donga newspaper says 30% of juveniles crimes decreased after high schools regulate to wear uniforms. Not until I red this report did I realize about requirement of uniforms. To give another example, if one student wearing a uniform want to smoke or go a dance bar, he or she may not be able to do that because many people know he or she is a student as they see the uniform. Consequently, I oppose that school permit students to decide what to wear to school. \n\nNext, high school students can concentrate on their studying. To put it simply, reducing time to select and buy the cloths make it possible for students to study more. For example, when I was a high school student, I did not need buy extra cloths for fasinating me who wear the uniform so that I could involved in my accomplishment. Moreover, they can save the money. By wearing the uniforms, they need to use neither the money nor time. \n\nTo sum up, I agree high schools do not have to require students to decide what to wear.

To illustrate, I fought with my roommate once because of my stolen stuff, when I was freshman of University in Korea.

They don''t have to worry about whether the day''s temperature is cold or hot, whether they are in ""style"", or what their friends are wearing.

The school uniform is more economic and saves money. However, when the school designs the uniform, it should consider students’ thoughts. The school should present samples and offer a vote to select its uniform. \n\nThe school uniform is for the students, but not for the teachers to wear. The opinion of students about the design of the school uniform is more important than the opinion of any others.

Compare the advantages of these two ways of obtaining things.  Which way do you prefer?  Explain why.', '"Since history began, trade has existed as well. Mankind invented the trade and market system because one could not produce all that he or she needed. Thus, in ancient times, our forefathers exchanged goods one another, while later they paid some money for what they wanted. There are both advantages and disadvantages of either paying money or paying products, but I prefer using money for the following two reasons; convenience and value-fixation. \n\nFirst of all, it is more convenient to pay for something with money than with goods in most cases. Let''s assume I were a farmer cropping watermelons. In such case, every time I need something, I have to bring some watermelons with me, which must be a strenuous work. If I use money, however, I can keep some in my purse, and I can visit where I want to go with my hands free. \n\nBesides, money keeps the value of our products lasting. Couldn''t I sell my watermelons, they would lose freshness and get pale. As time goes by, the value would plunder, and I would make far less money than before. However, if I exchanged redundant watermelons with moeny, I don''t need to worry about the value reduction, because I can keep moeny that is equal to their original value. \n\nIn sum, with money, we can not only easily go to market and buy what we want, but also keep the value of our goods unfrailed. Of course, trade with products has also some advantages; we can get what we need just through one-step, and we can save cost in making money.

Of course, they have not only a right to smoke, but also a duty not to behavior them a bad feel. My department, for example/TR>, has supplied a study room for undergraduate students.

However, I believe it was the internet network that should be remembered as the greatest change in 20th century. \n\nNowadays, there is no doubt how much the internet has changed our lives. First of all, we could assess to enormous information. It means we are no longer controlled by the government or the media like before. For example, in Korea, there was president election 2 years ago. The election was a lot different from previous ones. At the time we could get enough information from the internet, not passively accept from the newspaper or TV. In other words, we could participate in that with more objective information about the candidates. We could have a chance to distinguish which candidate was suitable for that job. The government could not control people by using mass media any more. We could actively get information from the internet and figure out which one is reliable. \n\nBesides, because of the internet network, we could contact with many people on the internet network.

Therefore, this is so amazing that if I want, I can talk a variety of people. Of course there is also disadvantages, such as intervening private life of celebrities However, I still think unless we abuse the internet in that way, we could take a lot of advantage of it. \n\nIn conclusion, the internet network has changed our lives a lot, compared with before. It provides us with huge amount of information available. And also it encourages us to enhance our point of view by talking with variety of people on-line network. There are still many changes made in 20th century, However, I believe the internet network was the most significant achievement in that it is related with the change of our source of information, from newspaper or TV to internet."', '2013-12-19 15:09:21', 'Tagging', 'essay', 'Y');

The pollution caused by gasoline and noise is nearly inevitable in most of big cities. Many people in big cities suffer from diseases originated from air pollution. Croweded people and cars in big cities cause a lot of stress and even can be a reason of mental disorder. On the other hand, small towns are reletively free from the pollution compared with big cities because of the low population and small number of cars. \n\nThe other reason is that it is easier to make friendships with neoghbors in small cities. In big cities, people have difficulty in talking with their neighbors because of busy life. In addition, high crime rate in many big cities keep people from making good relationship with other people. In small towns, people can know their neighbors easily, and can help each other when they have some hard house work. Community in a small town is more active and beneficial for members in the town.\n\nBy these reasons, healthy and cheerful life is possible in small towns.

We can see some teachers who just read and explain a text book without some knowledge or information from their head. The teachers are not elligeable to get much money. One of my high school teahcers, a literature teacher, was always a little bit soked with drink. We could smell it and he just made us read a text book during classes.

Nowadays, adult people get sick owing to insufficiency of health in Korea. It is known that only 24% of adult people take exercise, thus people must get exercise. .

Thus people eat high fat food so their health is gradually bad. According to the Josun-Ilbo which is the best-known newspaper in Korea, eating a low fat food prevents both diabetes and colon cancer.

Despite that, if I should choose one animal among them, dogs are the most significant in my country, Korea in terms of emotional development of children and dogs’ faithfulness. \n\nFirst of all, dogs are really helpful for the emotional development of children. That is, in the recent Korean society, parents are too busy for their work to take care for children and finally likely to make children selfish and rarely realizing the importance of sincere attention toward others.  In the case that children spend time with dogs while parents are not with them, however, they learn the spirit to consider others from dogs with giving a love to them like feeding, washing, wearing them.  Actually, one survey reported that Korean children grow up to the generous and mild character after living with dogs.\n\nMoreover, dogs are faithful and give a lesson to many Korean people.  There is the famous saying in Korea like “The faithfulness of dogs is better than people.”  As this saying means, they are extremely subordinate to their master and even if they are thrown a few miles away, they desperately come back to their master even without eating anything.  Actually, one dog called as “Jin-do” is the representative dog of Korea, a symbol of faithfulness.  Therefore, dogs’ unchangeable love and trust to their master give many Koreans to a meaningful lesson like as the trust among people. \n\nAccordingly, dogs are considered as the most important animal in Korea.

Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? "', '"There is a saying ""Nothing outlives book."" Since the creation of letters, people have started to record mysterious happenings, marvelous things, religious beliefs, historical events etc., in books. In this vantage point, books are not but  sums of human knowledge gained and experienced by people from ancient times to these days. However, knowledge and experiences in books have been ceaselessly refined and finally lost its crudity. As a result, knowledge gained from books are likely to be more abstract and indirect than knowledge gained from experience. \n\n       When we learn something by experience, it means that we happen to get a lesson about it by using our own body and soul. In contrast, when we learn something in books, it means we happen to know that by using only our brain. This is a great difference. For example, we can easily find books which say touching a burning pot could hurt you. However this kind of warning doesn''t make good effects because it is very abstract. On the contrary, if a person who happen to touch a burning pot by mistake, easily learns it is very dangerous to get closer to hot objects. Moreover he will memorize it for a long time. Therefore knowledge learned by experience is more realistic. \n\n       In addition, knowledge in books is apt to be biased. Knowledge and information in books are tend to reflect their writer''s point of view. It is not surprising to find various history books which witness the same historical event but show great different perspectives. Writers can deftly manipulate knowledge by hiding some or over-emphasizing a fact or another. This kind of cheating is easily overlooked by readers who are prone to believe that writers tell the truth. On the other hand, knowledge learned by experience is more direct. so there is no loophole for manipulation. For example, reports by press on damage or death toll for wars or disasters are often less precise than those by witness who experience the events in the place. \n\n       In my opinion, knowledge gained from books provide us basic and broad back ground information, But knowledge gained from experience give us more realistic and direct ideas for affairs. Therefore, I think knowledge learned by experience is more important and precious. Even though, knowledge in books seems to be better arranged and selected, we also have to listen carefully to vivid and living lessons of experience.

I means by the purpose of study that it indicate not only preparing the exam, but also recognizing the facts, such as historical events, mathmatics, economic and so on.

During IMF, some TV program I was used to enjoying introduced one city experiencing some changes after a factory established in it. Before a factory entered, many of the heads of the families in the city were not able to get jobs because of ''System-Control'' of the government. So many families underwent financial straits, and mood at home was heavy. Some of patriarches tried to deal with their mind as drinking, and fights were often occur on the street or at home. However, after building a factory, many jobless persons could get jobs and work on it. Families were released from financial pressure more and more and the atmosphere at home became warm. Also patriarches were not drinkers at all. All of the good changes originated from a new factory. \n     \n    However, there is another concern about building a new company : pollution.   My city has many lakes and streams. I would want to know if they would be affected. Could you remember the happening ''itai-itai disease'' in Japan from 1955 to 1957? The people in Doyama in Japan, especially old women, realized that their legs more and more bent into the inside.

Long vacation enables students to travel to a region far away from their towns. During an adolescent period, taking a long trip is very useful. Through that, they can learn the wisdom of life as well as the wide knowledge that they could not learn in classes. For example, I traveled to Austrailia and worked as volunteer in  ATCV(Austrailia Trust Conservation Volunteer) for two months by using my first university summer vacation. Through the trip, I learned not only the world view  but also the importance of the nature by experiencing ATCV in Austrailia. Therefore by providing the chance to have a long trip, they can widen their outlook on life. \n\n     On the other hand, a long vacation could be used as the time to prepare for the tests of special purposes. As you see, there are some tests needing long preparation times for special purposes such as foreign language ability and professional technique. However, if the time to be given were so short for preparing the test,  they cannot concentrate on the test and the possibility which they can pass the test could be smaller. For instance, there is my brother who studied computer software for a technical license for two months by using winter vacation, finally he could get the license, he was employed at one of the most famous computer companies. Consequently, through a long vacation, students can prepare for the test of special purposes and develop their special abilities . \n\nIn conclusion , I  have an opinion that if students use their long vacations effectively, they can broaden their experiences through traveling and enhance their special abilities by getting la long vacation  make students’ outlook more wide and give them the opportunity to prepare  for the  tests of special purposes. ful  for if students use their long vacations effectively, they can broaden their experiences through traveling and enhance their special abilities by getting licenses of the tests.

Because some sort of fiction make an effect on our dream, we dream of pilot,  president, a detective , scientist and so on.  As you see, the imagination play an important role as motive power which our dream come true. For example, after I read Gullivers’ travel written by Jonathan swift, for long time a deep impression and excitation didn’t disappear. Whenever possible I dream of the adventure and oversea travel, So far I traveled several countries such as Austrailia, America, India, Nepal, Thailand, Japan  and got precious ones through travel. Above I mentioned, reading a fiction make an good effect on the power of imagination  in our life. \n\nNext, reading a fiction is a good way to take a rest and get out of stresses. With a developing industry and tight schedule of our modern life, we are having a trouble with stresses which make us so tired physically and mentally , even which induce the disease  like  cancer. By using spare time, when we read fiction, we can relax us without a pill of tranquilizer and get out of stresses effectively. To illustrate, while I worked hard in graduate school due to a heavy burden of a national research project, I am in bad condition both mentally and physically, even while a mere trifle irritate me. I start to read novel “The Lord Of The rings” for a solution to get rid of my problem. It results in a good success. Even though tough research project and tight schedule, I can have a tranquil heart without stresses. Under mental stresses, sitting on the bench, let’s read an exciting novel, and then you feel free, comfortable. \n\nIn sum up, for the above-mentioned reasons, I support the idea that reading a fiction is beneficial for enhancing the power of the imagination and a good rest and the removal of our stresses. On top of that, we can say that these benefits from reading a fiction are priceless. "', '', '', '', '', 1, 1, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. \n\n"', '"Why is it so important to acquire knowledge that is true and real? Imaginative and creative people do not prefer to live in mediocre life. To be successful in these days, people must think unique and rare ideas. Therefore, I do not agree that people should read books which are published by real events, people, and facts. \n\n        Knowing only how to think common thought, people do not know methods of surviving in a real life. Let’s think that one has never imagined anything and has learned about only real facts.  He will be a very weird person in society; for example, he will believe nothing before he sees it if people tell stories which they experienced. Consequently, he will be not only isolated from others but also a doubtful and cold person. \n\n        For children, ability of imagination and creativity is a significant trait. Most mothers try to listen to music and read books before babies are born. This occurrence is all for developing baby’s ability to think imaginative ideas. However, if children read only non-fictional books, they will become ordinary and standard people in the future. In addition, creative people remain to be remarkably successful by inventing unique items or extraordinary business plans. Hence, being creative and imaginative is important nowadays. \n\n        In conclusion, people do not need to read only books about real events, people, and facts because it can reduce an ability to imagine ideas and make people unemotional. If you want to success in your life, read fictional books instead of non-fictional one and become creative and imaginative!

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. \r\n\r\n"', '"  In Korea society, most social system was under the influence of the Confucianism, so the authority of the teachers was so strong that we could not help obeying the order and the teachings of them, moreover evaluating them is not allowed. But as the time goes on and on, Viewpoint of the education is changing. Now, we can say and I agree with the above statement , ”Schools should ask students evaluate their teachers.” In that evaluating their teachers improve their skills and the quality of the education through the competition and is a good way for school administrators to evaluate teachers efficiently. \r\n\r\nIn the first place , evaluating teachers improve their skills and the ability of the education through the competition. As you see, the profession like teacher is stable and there is few possibility to be dismissed , on the other hand they are apt to fall in the period of a lassitude. Because teachers also are human being, they could get lazy and difficult to control their first minds, back to basics.  To get rid of this kind of a lassitude, evalutation about teachers give them some sort of incentives which refill with a passion. To demonstrate,  in our uviversity, the system of evaluating professors was introduced two years ago. Before it  was introduced, the atmosphere of the lecture room was changed into a big enthusiasm, so we can learn a lot. Finally, without being restricted from leftovers of  Confucianism and thinking twice, the introduction of  the system of evaluating teachers is beneficial to rational education to enhance their skills and quality of the education through the competition. \r\n\r\nIn the second place, it is a good way for school administrators to evaluate teachers efficiently. When the school administrators evaluate the achievement of teachers, so many factors are included to it. In my thinking, one of the most important factors is whether students are satisfied with the lecture of the teachers, which show us the ability and the quality of the teachers. For example , Korea Information and Communication University used this system four years ago. The teacher who  get the worst score of evaluation receive some penalty, In viewpoint of efficiency of the organization, they succeed in it. If glancing, evaluating other people might be seen to bad thing, but it could contain more positive effects. Therefore we call evaluating teachers as a good method for managing the school organization. I think there should be no exception in every organization . \r\n\r\nTo sum up , I take the review that evaluating teachers is necessary for improve their skills and the quality of the education through the competition and is the efficient method for school administrators to evaluate teachers. Furthermore the good quality  of  the  education system which we will get by evaluating teachers absoulutely contributes to the developments of korea "', '', '', '', '{"ibc":"1","thesis":"3","topic":"","coherence":"","transition":"","mi":"","si":"","style":"","usage":""}', 1, 1, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '2013-12-21 17:20:50');

Among them, I think knowledge of experience is more important than knowledge of books because of its durability, and it teaches us precious values like cooperation and flexibility. <br>         <br>               First, we hardly forget what we learn from our own experience. For example, we learn importance of money and difficulty of earning money in capitalistic society by studying economics through books. Also, we memorize how money circulates between producer and consumer written in textbooks. However, we usually forget about it as time passes. On the other hand, we can learn hardship of gaining money or way of profiting in person through part-time job. The reason is that they are more practical, and as we learn it using five senses. In short, knowledge of experience are more important because it''s unforgettable.   <br>        Secondly, knowledge of experience offers a sense of cooperation and flexibility which are important to build up one''s character. Even if we can gain boundless knowledges studying books about astronomy, mathematics, and so on, it''s no use if we bury ourselves in pedantic or impractical theory neglecting the value of cooperative spirit and flexibility, which can be gained by social experience like contacting directly with other people and various circumstances. To sum up, getting knowledge from experience is good to develop cooperative and flexible attitude.     <br>         <br>                In conclusion, if I have to choose between knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books, I would choose the former. The reason is that it''s lasts longer, and gives us cooperative and flexible mind. However, what we don''t have to forget is that both knowledges of experience and books must be in balance.', '', '', 1, 1, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '2013-12-21 13:27:19');

I believe that long vacation each year can be more helpful for the student than several short vacations throughout the year. \n\n     First, they can do something sufficiently they cannot do during the school time when they have long vacation like learning sports or traveling. When I was freshman in university, I desired to travel European country with back and went around the country with great satisfaction during 2 months summer vacation. If there were only 1 month vacation, I may have not traveled fully and have regretted the lack of time. \n\n    Second, they can be taught from their parents during vacation, and the home education is as important as the school education. When the students have enough long vacation, they can spend more time with their parents besides their other activity. When I was high school student, I helped my mother’s house choirs and my father’s work during winter vacation for 3 months. Before that time, I thought that I was deserved to be taken care of by my parents. But, though the experience, I felt really how difficult was my parents working, and I realized truly I had to respect my parents. It was through my real experience in home that I recognized sincerely respecting my parents. Eventhough I always learned from the teacher that I had to have regard in high my parents. \n\n    In addition, it is necessary for the students to prepare the next term. If they have only short vacation, they cannot have enough time to learn the real experience which cannot be taught from the school and relax at the same time. During vacation, they have to have the time not only doing something they would like to do but relaxing to prepare the next term. If there is only short vacation, they will be too busy to finish the vacation good and get ready the new school semester. \n\n     In conclusion, I am firmly convinced that the long term vacation is essential each year for the students to try what they would like to do which they cannot do during the term and have the opportunity to be trained at home.

All these things happen in our childhood years. <br><br>        Secondly, we get some tools needed for social activities. One of the most important thing is language. we have at least one language that is used our society, And, we speak our mother tongue. The era that we learn the language is also our childhood year. Moreover, we learn basic knowledge concerned science and mathematics in the elementary school, which is needed for the study and research that we are going to do. So, we have to take some tools like language and basic knowledge for our future. Unintentionally, and naturally, we learn those things in our childhood years. <br><br>        Conclusively, if some person has bad time in the childhood years, his all life would be unhappy. It may not true, but he has more chance to be unhappy than normal people. It is because that something wrong in childhood years can influence to his life; bad socializazion or lack of knowledge.

They do not see their children with objective views, so they find their children’s mistakes as well as correct their faults. When I ate with my family, children run around the restaurant and made a noise as if it is their house. Although the children’s behaviors had bad influences on other people, their parents do not scold them and angry to people who scold their children. \n\n  Second, parents are not the best teacher because their knowledge does not cover all fields. Although they have various experiences and wisdom for living, they lack expert knowledge on diverse areas such as art, science, and history. Therefore, they could give their children an erroneous knowledge or information, so it may have negative effects on them. If your children ask you what you do not know, you can not give them the right answer. Consequently, your children are disappointed with you, and you might lose your authority as parents. \n\n  In conclusion, it is fact that parents play an important role in their children’s life.

However, if students can use a computer, these inconvenient things would be solved by computers, because students using computers can easily connect a school network system and Internet, and they can easily find information, which they need. \n\n        Secondly, students who work with computers can process much information in real time. For instance, if you want to find some books without computers in the library, you would spend a lot of time to find an index card, and to know that the book is still there or lended.  Maybe to find a book would take at least ten minutes without help of the computer. However, if you use a computer, you can direct search the book that you need, and you can get the book in no time. Of course, if you use Internet, you can also find a wide variety of information such as research papers, latest articles, and news in no time. Thus, students with computers can access information more quickly than students without computers. \n\n        Lastly, computers can be used in a wide variety of school works. For example, now, nowadays students use computers for research and word processing needs. Some teachers use computers for providing their course homework and information.  Moreover, many universities in Korea require students to learn computer, because the process of application of the course are completely computerized. My university also has computerized enrolling system. If the university buys many computers, students who don’t have a computer would be easily enrolled in the course, which they want. \n\n        In conclusions, I strongly believe that computers would be best choice to greatly improve the environment of the library. Even though books are simple to read, and they do not need such knowledge of the computer, I am sure that quickness-ability, access-ability, and wide application-ability of the computer are more valuable than books.

People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts. Use specific reasons and details to support your opinion. \n   "', '"It is needless to say that most books are written by those who have their own respective thoughts and want to have the books to be read by many other people. Simultaneously, the contents of the books should be different to each other. I am for sure it is good to have plenty of thoughts and philosophies in the world so that we can share them. Therefore, I am for the statement that people need to read both fiction and non-fiction for a couple of reasons. It will be viewed from following two aspects. \n\n  Firstly, one of the critical reasons why people should read both books about real events and unreal events is that we can learn to know what other people are thinking by reading the both kinds of books. The thoughts of other people could be about real phenomena or creative ideas. For example, had it not been for the novel of Aldous L. Huxley, Brave New World, we couldn''t even have a chance to imagine how tragic the world would be if the science technology had been developed without conscience. Thanks to the very creative fiction, people in 1932 could be inspired to think about the future. I don''t think any other facts in the book can do better to do it than the novel. To sum, people had better have access to other people''s creation by reading various kinds of books not just by reading non-fiction. \n\n  Secondly, the creative thoughts of children should be boosted by a lot of great fiction. We all know that children have much curiosity and try to meet their needs by reading, watching and tasting and so on. I think novels, such as science fiction and fables are very much adequate to satisfy kids. My brother, who majors in shipbuilding technology at the moment, dreamed about becoming a good scientist when he was very young with reading various kinds of scientific novels. I think this could be a good example how much children are affected by creative works of good authors. The creative thoughts of children should not be eroded; instead, it has to be enhanced by good fiction. \n\n  In conclusion, people have to read fiction as well as established facts because all people want to and have right to share ideas with other great contemporary thinkers and writers. Futhermore, vast imaginary stuff in fiction can develope creativeness of children. That we have many a good novels, which stimulates our imagination, is very adorable in this mechanical and highly standardized society.

In my case, generally I take museum as the first stop for my visit because I can understand that area easily, fast and effectively.

We can learn brief history of that area by seeing historical stuff displayed at the museum. What''s more, we can find out how that area''s economic and cultural status is. In most case, if a certain local government is not in good cultural or economic state, the government tend not to invest on such faculties such as museum. It is because, to them, there are many things they have to invest first. On the contrary, if the local government and that area is flourishing, it is clear that they cherish their historical stuff. \n\nIn addition, we can make some memories about certain place by visiting museum. We can see valuable historical remains that can not be seen at the other area.

As economy grows rapidly, people concern about whether Korea can become more affluent or not. In Korea’s circumstance where natural resources are limited, talented people need to be trained. With part of that worries, some people urge to use English as an official language. It is inevitable to Korea to survive from globalization which accelerates competitiveness among the nations. How ever, in my opinion, finding our national characteristics is more important than following advanced nations recklessly. \n\nOne of the biggest concerns is that we could lose our emotion of nation. We have more than 2,000 years of history and always proud of our nation. In 2002 World Cup, for instance, Korea showed intensive nationalism throughout the world. We all dressed red shirts and proud of what we made. Another example of our self-esteem is ‘Han-Gul’ which is Korea’s official language. Han-Gul is the perfect language that expresses every human feelings in words and also write every language that people use all over the world.

As an example of Korean novel, there are good novels in Korea which could not award novel prize at literature, because Han-Gul could not interpret properly. \n\nIn conclusion, Using English as an official language does not mean fostering national competitiveness.

Because I''m student, I am not able to afford food price at restaurants 30 days a month and 12 months a year. It was  always my parents who gave a pocket money to me. I realized that the older we are , the more difficult we get a money from parents. Even if I have money to go chow hall, I have tried to keep the money in bank for my future. When we eat food at home, It’s possible to store food that we left. It’s a common sense that most of restaurants have dumped the food away right after customers set off from restaurants. It not only made environmental problems, but also raised the food price. I saw one article in newspaper that government and private companies spent two billion won to recover the environment. I also want to mention about tip culture. It’s recommended to leave 10~15% of your whole food price on the desk, when you leave the restaurant. If the waiter impressively served to you, you would like to leave more money than regular tips. \n\n  Secondly, eating at home is more safe than restaurant, or food stall. Generally speaking, most restaurants more interest money than any other things. One broadcaster reported the news that most of the fast-food store’s sanitations are terrible. Part time job members usually didn’t  wash their hands when they start working and didn’t use a plastic glove.  A  worker said that a host just always has pushed him to work quickly and didn’t say anything about safty of making food. As you can see, your mother always tries to make healthy food for family members. Whenever she was about to buy some ingredients, she looked carefully about the expiration and the condition of food not the price of that. As a result, Family members are able to feel mother’s love. \n\nThirdly, family members can share the feeling of membership. We are so busy with our own businesses that we are no longer interested with  the lives of our near and dear ones.

Some people maintain that this behavior don’t affect friendship. However, in my opinion, borrowing money from my friends can affect negatively our friendship because this can damage my friend’s financial statement and might break confidence between friends. \n    First of all, if a person borrow some money from his or her fiend, it can give trouble to the friend because of the financial problem. For example, I am a university student and I earned money by doing part-time job to afford my tuition. In this case, I always have trouble in my financial statement. Two months ago, one of my friends answered me to lend one hundred dollars and I lent the money despite my condition for my friend and consequently I got in financial trouble.

So I wanted to say what some of the quialities of a good parent are. I think good parents have to show their passion about what they are doing, generosity and they have not to make an unhappy family. Let me tell you specifically about them. \n\n     One of the features of the good parent is that they show that they are doing their best whatever they do. It is really important. From a baby to adult, children see his parents during his life. As growing, children are realizing what they should do from their environment. One of the most important things which effect them is of course his father and mother. If his father shows that his best and passion about something. It will effect his sons and daughters as good advantages. \n\n    Another point I think is that usually good parents are very generous. If father shows mercy for the poor, children will learn how to mercy someone. If he shows just his passion about something, his sons and daughters will learn just a passion from his father and mother not generosity. It means it is possible children will be selfish. \n\n    The last point I think is that the good parents don’t make unhappy for their family. Economical capablity is also important and their personality is also important. However, I think the most important thing is that good parent make their family very happy. Some good parents never fight in front of children. It is sure that they are trying to make a happy family. Usually a guy who does criminal is from an unhappy family. When parents fight each other, statistics shows children suffer a lot of stress. It makes them to go out of the houses. \n\n     To be a good parent, they should make happy family. To be a good parent, they have to show their passion to their children. Itself will be a good education. To be a good parent, they should teach what generosity is to prevent their children from being selfish. What are more important? I think that these are the most important things to be a good parent. I don’t mean there aren’t other important things.

By doing so, they can apply what they learn at school to a real working situation. If you are majoring in advertising, then you can work at advertising firm, such as LG Ad (well-known advertising company in Korea), as a creative designer, and really involve in making advertisements. I also had worked as an intern at a consulting firm during my vacation in my junior year and it was really a great time. \n\n    Secondly, one long vacation is good for students to travel around to the places they want to know more.

However, people have an experience like having a job in teenager, he or she can know about their temperament. For example, whether they like to follow the commend of boss or not. In addition, they may catch what kind of work they like. For instance, when a boy work in fast-food during teenager, he know about whether he likes and is good at selling articles.\n   \nSedondly, having a job teenegers in still students is a good idea because they can have an experience before they got a fail in real society after graduate a school. When a teenager who want to get a whose food-market, he or she get a job relative with food-market when they are teenager. As having that kind of a job when he or she duing still student, he or she can learn many knowledge such as the most important things or threaten things before the person manage own the food-market. \n     \nThirdly, having a job teenagers in still stuednt is a good idea because they can apply the knowledge that was learnd in the class to real situation. For instance, a curious teenager is taughted about the supply and demend in an economy class. While he or she have a job that can get a item from a firm and sell to people, he or she can know certainly what is the real supply and demend. \n\nIn sum, having a job when they are teenagers is good idea because they can have not only an opportunity to find what is their fiber, but also an experience apply their knowledge that are taughted in class to real circumstance. In addition, they can have an pre-exercise that can reduce the possibility to fail rather than they are graduate their school."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

For these effects, most psychologists suggest their patients to raise pets, because raising pets can slow disease rate, alleviate bad mood-condition, and even cure disease.

However, after a medical operation, she got a serious pain. She wanted to relieve pain, so she used many kinds of medicine, but there were no way to alleviate her pain by medicine.

Second, reading books improves work efficiency.\n \nFirst of all, reading books can allow people to broaden their horizon. By reading a lot of books, they can learn about different worlds of lifestyles, basic customs and cultures. It is obvious that they may go through trial and error. However, they can learn to embrace diversity through this experience. For example, when I had a part-time job, there was an Ethiopian girl who brought home-cooked meals for lunch.

On the other hand, being educated on Africa and African table manners through various books, I was perfectly understanding and comfortable with what was taking place.\n \nIn addition, reading books can encourage people to work with more passion. This is attributed the fact that it can serve as one of the key motivators for them to perform better and to improve themselves. With such motivation, they put in more effort, concentrate better on their tasks, and feel a greater sense of responsibility for their work.

In particular, the employees in Group A followed instructions, submitted assignments on time, and participated actively in group meetings. On the other hand, those in Group B dozed off and lacked focus while working.

The study further explained that physical activities lubricates the brain to function in perfect condition, making it in perfect condition to study better. This is why universities should not underestimate the effect of investing money on sports activities. Therefore, universities should provide proper environment for students to exercise on regular basis by putting much money and effort on sports.\n\nNot only sports activities promote physical condition which eventually affect positively on academic performance, it also triggers healthy interaction between students.

Due to the decreasing number of newborn babies, a big portion of Korea’s citizens is aged 65 and older. This matter can damage our economy badly because the country should invest a lot of money on taking care of retired seniors. Also, since there aren’t enough babies being given birth, Korea cannot raise new workers of the future. Isn’t there any way we can escape from this situation?\n \n The first thing we can do to solve problems related to the low birth rate is to encourage mothers and fathers to give birth to more children. The biggest reason why parents aren’t having children is because of the amount of money they should spend to raise them. (education fees, money to buy their clothes, etc.) The money spent to raise a child is impossible to be calculated, and parents are concerned if they would face hardships in managing their budgets. In this situation, the government can support them in spending money for their kids. Currently, the government of the Republic of Korea is funding fees spent for a third child in a family. Our country needs to come up with more ideas like this one in order to attract mothers to help increase the birth rate.\n \n The second solution is to let citizens know more about the seriousness of the decreasing birth rate. A lot of parents in Korea aren’t aware of the reasons why low birth rate is such a serious crisis. They don’t know that when a big number of citizens become 65 and older, our nation’s economic growth can slow down because we cannot raise enough workers for companies, and the government needs to spend a big part of people’s taxes for healthcare and retirement life of seniors.

We can encourage parents to have more children, and write books and show news broadcasts about the issue in order to let the public realize that it is a huge matter. Personally, I think one of the reasons why it is hard to increase the birth rate is because not every citizen of our country is participating in coming up with solutions.

Due to the increased amount of greenhouse gasses being released into the atmosphere, our world is suffering from global warming and destruction of the ozon. In order to avoid this situation, many scientists are thinking of ways to find a planet everyone can migrate to when it becomes impossible to live on Earth. This is one of the reasons why people are investing a huge amount of money on outer space exploration. However, it sounds more ideal to spend governments’ funds to deal with earthly matters, not space exploration.\n \n To begin with, it isn’t easy to find a planet we can move to in the future. As I have mentioned above, planet Earth is greatly polluted nowadays. It is expected that in a few decades or so, it would be impossible to breathe in fresh air and drink clean water on our planet. Since they are too worried to face the future, people are in search for planets we can move to. However, it is very difficult to find our ideal planet. Until now, scientists weren’t able to find an appropriate planet for humans. Nearly every planet they discovered lacked water and air. Also, even though they have found an alternative home for people, it would take countless light years for us to get there. Instead of spending time and money on looking for a new planet, it would be easier to engage more in bringing our nature back to its original condition.\n \n Moreover, it is easier to find new resources on Earth than in outer space. Many people agree that one of the reasons why people are investing a lot of money on space exploration is because they want to find new materials there. Since we lack coals and other natural resources, a lot of countries think that they would be able to find alternative energies easily off Earth. However, I disagree with this. Even though we discover planets with rich minerals and energies, it still takes a lot of time and costs a lot for us to go there and bring those resources to Earth. It is better to think of more ways we can use nature (sunbeam, wind, water, etc.) to create new types of energy because it is much faster than space exploration.\n \n  It is more ideal for governments to spend their funds on problems related to Earth, not ones about outer space. This is because it isn’t easy to find a planet to migrate to, and it is easier and faster to discover new energies on our planet than in space. I don’t mean that we shouldn’t have any curiosities about other planets and stars.

Then why do people love TV so much? Some say endless entertainment attract people and others say easy access to education and information which was dominated by selected ones for centuries were the key fact to be loved so much. Nevertheless, I think disadvantages of TV overpower its favorable function especially lack of communication among friends and family.\n \nFirst of all, TV attracts every attention toward its programs, so it can interrupt communication while watching them. There might be someone who resists admitting and saying they can perform activities perfectly while watching TV such as having meals and speaking on the phone. But they would finally admit the quality of doing will go down. They don’t taste of food much and don’t know how much they eat. And also they might experience either their conversation on the phone end up or they mute the TV to remove possible interruption. So does conversation with friends and family. People can talk over and over while watching TV, but usually topics of conversation might end up all TV-related. Fortunately non-TV related conversation has started it is hard to get it off one’s chest while watching it.\n \nLast but not least, TV kills time without meaning, so precious time with people who you love is wasted. In modern society, people are extremely busy and they have limited span of time to be with their family or friends. But we generously allow our time to watch TV. What a waste?  I have experienced the same. I flipped through the channel with the remote and spent meaning less time with my family and finally went to bed without talking much. Only conversation I remember was: “Is there any other program? Why don’t we turn on the channel X?” So I lost my precious time watching idiot box instead of sharing my opinions and emotions with them.\n \nIn conclusion, TV destroys communication among people you love as well as relationship with them. We should understand the value of communication with them and make the most of it instead of killing time to watch TV. To do so, we need to use TV smartly. We can make rules to set time limits and choose programs in advance to avoid inevitable watching especially for children who are heaviest viewers among family."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

For fast development, competition is very effective method especially to the company. In capitalization society, people should compete with their coworkers, other company and other countries. It is also realized in the school. For example, when I was a high school student, there were a great deal of competition among students to go to the good university.

People are social animals and they live with their lovely family. The familiarity of family members plays very important role in our happy lives. However, in this fast changing society, family is breaking rapidly. According to the research of the Seoul University, the divorce rate increased fifty percent compared to the last 1990s. This research shows us that so many couples broke up and so did the family. In the past, only few couples got divorced easily. Increasing divorce rate also means that many children are living in one parent family. In this environment, children can not grow well. This family bankrupting is very important reason why we are unhappy.\n\nIn conclusion, we who live in fast changing society are not happy compared to the people who live in the past.

However, there exist many side effects of the internet that actually hamper effective learning. Therefore, I disagree with the statement that students can learn from on-line.\n\nFirst and foremost, the internet provides too much information. This means that it contains invalid and incorrect information which could mislead students. When students are faced with invalid information, it is highly like that they cannot distinguish it from other reliable information but just accept it. For example, when I was high school student, I relied on the internet to finish my literature homework. I decided to log in one literature forum and ask some question related to Korean poetry in 20th century. I believed that people in the literature forum knows about questions that I asked. However, I realized that answers from the internet were absurd in some parts. Now, I can see that not every person in that forum was good at literature. I believe that their fragmented information hampered my learning at that time. As seen from this compelling example, students can gather unconvincing information from the internet and that information could disrupt effective learning.\n\nSecondly, students could not be inculcated with the way to think by themselves because the internet provides answers within a few seconds without providing room for thinking. In other words, students could not rear the ability of abstract thinking and inference which is essential for the effective learning. This idea was reflected on the recent study conducted by 100 teenage students. A group of students who do not use the internet for their study got high scores in an inference ability test whereas the other group of students who use the internet got relatively low scores. Therefore, the internet could not help the real learning because it cannot offer chances of making one’s own thought.\n\nIn conclusion, using the internet is not helpful for student’s learning. It not only provides low quality information and misleads students but also takes away chances of having logical thinking.

In that when people do dangerous tasks, they are likely to hurt or lost their lives; when they do boring work, they tend to be lethargic, technologies have strongly helped people to become happier. For example, in the past, when people needed to make tunnels, workers had to do perilous tasks including breaking stones with tools in person and conveying them. Through the processes, many people got hurt and dead because of unfortunate accidents. According to the record which is calculated by the Ministry of Labor of Korea, in 1950s, the number of workers who dead in tunnel construction sites was about 3,500. Compared to that, at present, there are much fewer people lost their lives while doing construction work. This is absolutely because construction technologies have advanced.

In that anyone''s life is directly concerned with other''s happiness, science technologies have improved our lives.\n \n  Also, science technology let us communicate each other much better.

Moreover, development of telecommunication has allowed us to make conversation easily which will also help us to make deep relationships.

According to a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly 80% of students replied that they could restore their bonds with colleagues through sports. This survey also shows that these 80% could exchange ideas and develop sympathetic bonds while doing exercise together. This increases emotional attachment and, by extension, social awareness.\n\nTo sum up, because of the reasons mentioned above, I firmly believed that putting as much money on sports as on libraries by universities should not only be allowed, but encouraged.

It is controversial that for which ages, between young people and older people, celebrities'' opinions are important. I believe that the opinions of celebrities would be more important to youngsters. It would be more influential and persuasive than opinions from others for them.\n\nTo begin with, the opinions of celebrities are influential, especially for young people. For these days, many celebrities try to communicate with their fans by using SNS(Social Network Service; for example, Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter). The major user of this service is young people. In addition, the characteristic of young users is fast forwarding, sharing speed. Thus, what celebrities say spreads fast. According to the result conducted by Korean National University, only one hour is required to spread some news into all 20’s in the world. On the other hand, three days are needed to spread same news into all 40’s in the world. In other words, lots of young people can be assimilated with what celebrities say.\n\nFurthermore, the opinions of celebrities are persuasive. Generally, the more people are young, the more likely to imagine of what they want to be. Hence, lots of youngsters follow celebrity trends. They even try to share emotions or feelings of celebrities. This is why young people are easily moved from what celebrities say. For example, until a Korean famous singer insists that pets be well-treated more than current condition, most people except who loves pets were indifferent about animal cruelties. After the singer’s opinion, lots of young people including their family members, relatives participated in the signature-collecting campaign for protecting abused pets.\n\nA strong word can change public opinion.

It is citizen’s freedom and their own will to buy cars and drive them. In addition, it is wholly their choice of freedom to drive anytime anywhere. Such basic rights of freedom should be protected under any circumstances. No society or authority has given rights to interfere such choice. Charging fees on driving their private cars is one of these acts that go against the principle. Therefore, the charge should not be put on any given situation.\n \nOn top of that, charging on driving their private mobiles is not a good way to solve deeper problem which is traffic congestion. I believe that the idea comes from the chronicle trouble that every city goes through which is traffic congestion. Making drivers to pay extra charges is only a temporary solution to this problem. That is, some people will still want to drive their mobiles even though they have to pay few extra charges because it is just more convenient, leaving the problem unsolved.

It is the opportunity to see extraordinary environments and cultural monuments with relaxed mind. In other words, the first purpose of travel for tourists is relaxing. When it comes to think a group tour, however, you can easily imagine the time tables and schedules for accommodations, museums, transportation and meals, which were already fixed before departure by tour guide.

As we well know, group tour cannot provide various options to see those things; they only provide limited routes for glancing some popular things, without consideration of tourists'' interests.

You can enjoy your time at your favorable space; you can grab a chance to watch MLB at the stadium, without watching some boring national history museum.\n \nAs I have stated, the group tour has a more disadvantage than advantage because of the inflexible and pre-planned schedules.

This is because while people do their best at their work and in their study, they not only gain great rewards but also  valuable assets such as diligence and time management skilles which would help them persistently.

Nonetheless, I strongly suggest that government put environmental problems before health care because reduced environmental problems can mean less health care burden for government and a large portion of environmental problems cannot be treated individually whereas people can individually care for their own health.\n\nFirst of all, if government pay more attention to environmental concerns, health problems will naturally decrease. Environmental pollution is one of the leading factors of disease nowadays. Therefore, if government increase its investment in environmental protection and enforce stricter laws, it can consequently cut its budget for health care. For instance, if someone suffers lung cancer which is usually known to be caused by air pollution, this person will probably rely on government subsidies to receive expensive treatments. If government had paid more attention to regulate environmental pollution in the first place, government would not have had to spend a dime on this person. Consequently, government should pay more attention to environmental concerns as a long term solution to health problems.     \n\nSecondly, environmental issues cannot usually be handled individually while each person can look after own health. Environmental problems are global concerns which require the initiatives of government. For example, the deforestation in Amazon is causing severe global scale problems such global warming. However, there is a limit to what individuals can do to stop these without the help of  government. On the other side, health problems can be dealt individually by regularly exercising and maintaining healthy diet. There is nothing much government can do except for financially subsidizing patients.

That is, from the very early age, children get to build relationships with different types of people including grandparents, uncles, aunties, and nephews. Such family members are belong to different age groups and each relationship is different and unique from each other. Therefore, children naturally learn how to communicate with the younger, older, male, or female, developing communication skills dealing with various types of people which they will encounter in the society. Such skills are essential part of life for children to live harmoniously. For example, my friend Min-young was born in the extended family which includes many family members.

This can be seen among the teenagers most of the times, since teens tend to have a longing for certain celebrity they favor and idolize them; hence, feel curiosity towards the thoughts and perspectives he or she has and easily are influenced by these thoughts.

While there are many good arguments for both positions, the following argument will explain in detail why I agree.\n\n  My first argument for the influence of people should be espoused. This is because people play critical roles in developing our untapped talents. Modern-day people live hectic lives because today''s globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. Consequently, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the fields of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for people to help us to develop our talents and tap into our full potential. Therefore, people'' influence cannot be overlooked in this context. According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people who are under the close guidance of their co-workers and boss at their workplace decide on their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not. The majority of education experts argued that people are likely to be unproductive if they do not fully receive the advice and help of their peers and boss, especially when they are in their potential stages.\n \n  Moreover, my strong support for people'' influence can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that people, with their years of experience, can offer lessons on morality and ethics. People who are not still mentally immature have long way to go before they become experts in their fields. During this long journey, they tend to make many mistakes and are prone to misbehave. However, people can be guided by their closer friends and mates, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms and can thus become good models for society. In this respect, people exert good influence on us. For example, undeveloped people may give in to the temptation of playing computer games all nights long because they are too immature to judge right from wrong. This is why people'' influence is an urgent need. With the guidance of them, such as co-workers or boss of us, we can learn how to avoid such temptations and become law-abiding citizens, by listening our advisers'' descriptions of their own experiences.

However, I firmly believe that even though it would be risky that destroy a relationship, people should take action for their friends for following reasons: First, one can''t make wise decision alone and second, it will worsen a friendship if something gets wrong with a friend.\n\nTo begin with, every human being is not perfect creature. Which means we always can''t make smart decision by ourselves in all situations. That is why a good friend exists. People should help their friends to do right thing when others seem to walk along the wrong path. For example, I have an old friend named Jihee. Since Jihee has always felt that she needs to study more, she decided to study abroad in United States after she graduated college. After getting in graduate school in California, everything seemed going well with her. However, one day I realized via her friend that she got addicted to alcohol because she could not get used to new life in strange country and had heavy pressure under the a lot of tests she had to pass. As one of closest friend, I was worrying about her situation. So I flew to her place and persuaded her to take off the school for a year and come back to hometown. At first, she refused to take my advice, but she soon went back to Korea with me and got some therapies for her alcohol addiction. If I had not taken any action for her situation, she would be in serious trouble by now. Therefore, it is important to guide friends into right direction rather than sitting back and watch them making wrong decisions.\n\nOn top of that, just letting a friend decide any choice can worsen relationship sometimes. If a friend''s decision get wrong and something bad happens to her, she may blame on me having not told any advice to her. Thus it would break our friendship. For example, when I was in high school, I used to have a friend Nancy. At that time Nancy was considering breaking up with her boyfriend because he would not respond her messages and calls for two weeks. Even though I saw that guy walking with a strange girl at the shopping mall, I didn''t give her any advice because it could hurt her feelings. Also I thought all matters were up to Nancy. However, after she realized the boy was cheating on her, Nancy suddenly blamed on me that I haven''t told anything I knew to her. After for a while, Nancy apologized to me about being dramatic, but we could not get along well as we used to. This example implies that sometimes letting a friend making own decisions is not good idea and may break a relationship.\n\nTo sum up, I agree with the idea that taking action that risks destroying a friendship Is better than letting a friend make a mistake. Since people usually can''t make smart decision alone, friends need to guide that right direction. Also, sometimes sitting back and allowing a friend decide whatever they want will worsen a friendship if something gets wrong with her."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

This situation naturally discourages people communicate with their extended family. In a nutshell, it will be no difference between extended family and strangers in near future. Considering current trend, I believe that the importance of extended family is just an illusion.\n\nSecondly, nowadays, people live in a big competition. All the things related to their life belong to the matter of competitions. For example, teenagers compete their academic grades, a business man compete their companies. There is no enough time to looking how their family lives well or similar things.

However, as far as I''m concerned, teachers should not evaluated only by their students'' grades for two reasons: teachers have to pay attention to not only how to teach effectively, and students would not no longer thank teachers'' efforts on class. \n \n First of all, teachers should also give attention to character education as well as class. This is very important and time-consuming education while the result rarely appears to be good grades. The purpose of schools is not only in improving students'' intellectual ability, but also growing them as good members of society. Since we are living together having interactions, there is more possibility that success in life is up to one person''s character like responsibility, morality, not rely upon how much knowledge they have. For example, There is a hairdressor from Korea who succeed in Philippines as a boss of tens of shops. Actually, he was not a honor student because he didn''t like studying general subjects. However, he met a homeroom teacher when he was in middle school who always encouraged him to find his talent and emphasized and let know like growing leadership, time-management skill, and endurance are so important in life than winning good grades. He said that from the teacher, he got courage, got to know how to live an independant life, and he found his flair and decided to be a hairdressor. Even he said that his enterprise at present would not exist if she did not encouraged him. In this sense, we can know teachers'' education much affect one''s life,and this is not knowlege, but wisdom. Wisdom does rarely appear as students'' grades, but it is essential for teachers to teach. When teachers are evaulated and paid only with their teaching skill, they are more likely to spend less time how they can make their students wiser and good members of society. Thus, I strongly believe that teaching skill cannot be a standard how much they get paid.\n \n Also, the relationship between students and teachers would more likely to be superficial. This is because students would think that the reason teachers spend long time how to teach effectively is only for his or her better finance, not from love for students. There is believe that educators are the people who educate students to cultivate good social being, so pupils respect their teachers since they feel teachers love their being although they get salaries. If such policy come to be true, they would regard the teachers who put a lot of efforts into class just instructors, and pupils would not also realize the true heart of educators to enhance their intellectual ability which let them live with widen perspectives. According to a survey conducted by psychology department of Chicago university, There was huge difference between two groups: A group of schools enacted the salary policy based on students'' performances, and B group did not. The students of the schools of A group tended not to follow educators'' advice, and the rate of the juvenile delinquent was higher about 30 percent more. Moreover, they were thinking teachers only educate for their financial condition, and they are not loved by them. In this sense, how well teach students should not be a criteion for educators'' salaries.\n \n In short, if educators get paid based on students'' peformances, for their high salaries, they would not spend enough time making students suitable members of society, and students would not appreciate their teachers'' endeavor to develop teaching skill because they would think their effort is for money, not for love for pupils.

As far as I am concerned, I am in complete disagreement with the argument. The two ideas stated below can be sufficient evidence to support my disagreement.\n\nMy first argument for teachers'' personal views on politics should be espoused. This is because they help students to be well-balanced. While students grow up, they are exposed to certain types of the information and knowledge about the world, through education at school as well as at home. The problem with this is that most of information and knowledge is conveyed from one source''s particular viewpoint. Given this, in order to be well-informed, students try to learn about different viewpoints through their teachers'' personal views on politics. In my case, I acquired information about exploring space by chatting with my friends. Due to the friends, I came to be fully exposed to the great achievements of governmental space projects. However, my perspectives on these governmental projects could not be solely positive when I knew the difficulty of exploring space and frequent struggles with political parties involved through my teacher''s views on politics in the classroom. Without these political view points, I might have held a slanted view of what was going around me.\n\nMoreover, my strong support for teachers'' private ideas on politics can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that they can allow students to get the latest information. Our world is evolving at a surprising speed. As a result, students may have difficulty understanding all of the changes and new events come about. Given this context, it is important that they try to keep current by learning about changes and events through their teachers'' personal views on politics. In a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly two thirds of surveyed students felt that they could update their knowledge and successfully adjust themselves to the changing social trends through different views on politics by their teachers in the classroom. According to the surveyed students, these personal political views prevented them from being confined to an outdated world. It is no surprise that there has recently been a drastic increase in the number of students who love to hear their teachers'' personal views on politics to gain the latest knowledge of the world.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that students can become well-rounded by accepting their teachers'' personal views on politics in the classroom.

Also, people can get expertise.\n\nTo begin with, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people can save money. Most often, money tends to be very important in our everyday lives. If people are different from others, they will make the most of their money. Take my uncle, for example. It is very efficient to be different from others. My uncle did not waste money for drinking when he was in college. In contrast, his friends were drinking every week like other people. Thus, they spent much money when they were college student. Unlike his friends, my uncle did not spend money for drinking for 7 years and made their own restaurant by using that money. This result clearly shows that being different from others help people become successful because of efficiency.\n\nMoreover, another reason which proves my point is that people can get expertise. Commonly in society, many accomplished people tend to have expertise. Therefore, people can succeed if they are different from others because it help them get expertise. A really good example can be seen in Minhan Kim. I read online that Kim, the CEO of the CS company, achieved great success because he was different from others. Kim, using this expertise, transformed his company one of the most profitable software enterprises in Korea.

There is a proverb that ""Early bird catches bugs"". Likewise, it is the most fundamental quality for supervisor who manages many people under his or her hand. If a company have an idle boss, it would ruin very quickly. For example, there was a chairman of some company, he always drank every night and did not care any tasks of the company. Eventually, he got fired because his subordinates completely hated him.\n \nAlso, confidence is substantial trait of a good supervisor''s requirement. Generally, a supervisor manages a lot of subordinates under his feet. To lead many people''s opinion, the leader should have great leadership that never sway by other assertions. If he would not decide his will or would not gather other people''s diverse arguments, the company''s policy would face a lot of problems.

However, that hesitation resulted in a bigger confusion.\n \nIn addition, a warm-hearted mind is needed to someone who would like to be a great supervisor. This characteristic can obtain much better respect from subordinates. In all likelihood, no one would not like the supervisor who has a nice manner and is very kind. It is said that someone gives a goodwill to others, he will return it as much as he was given. Therefore, if someone utterly wants to be a great boss, he should have a thoughtful mind to others.\n\nTo conclude, there are some indispensable elements to be a good advisor. they are diligence, confidence and warm heart.

Specifically, playing with friends require to arrange meeting time, places and what they will do. This is possible to cause additional stress for an individual because it is time-consuming and hard to reconcile the options.

On the other hand, in today’s society, there are numerous entertainment every person can enjoy without gathering other people.

Enjoying own hobby has an influence on psychological happiness. Thus, having a hobby is the best for spending holidays. However, there are things to do during holidays such as home chores, meeting friends. It is not easy to make time for enjoying own hobby. For example, in my country, people generally work for five days a week.

Enjoying own hobby has an influence on psychological happiness Therefore, I prefer to working three days a week for long hours.\n \nMy next reason for supporting working three days a week for long hours is because workers can go travel during their holidays. Travel allows people not only to stress out, but also to increase productivity. To be specific, through travelling, people can enjoy their life at a distance. Seeing a wonderful landscape and eating a delicious food will give a sound body with a sound mind. They will be ready for getting back to work place with good condition.

It is evident that if one teacher supports one particular party or one-sided position, it definitely leads students to take a stance analogous to teacher’s thoughts. For example, according to research by the Korea University, in the test, researchers set two divided classes. One teacher explained the Iraq War as a way to attain world peace, while the other one portrayed the war caused by the invasion of the US to obtain Oil. Surprisingly, after each teacher finished their descriptions, students followed the positive or native view against the war at high rates. It demonstrated that how partial and biased view can be made by teachers’ own perspective.\n\nSecond, not only does it disrupt students to cultivate impartial view related to political and social events, in term of a teacher’s duty, it also can not be allowed to let students know what the teacher’s view is. That is, most students come to school to learn specific knowledge so that they are able to prepare easily to pursue a future career or to enter into top universities. However, if teachers focus on imparting ambiguous ones, which contain political perspective, some of students would regard it as a waste of time because it may not be helpful to prepare their crucial exams. This is true that students are require to grow their own view about social affairs since they are also one of the members in society, but I am convinced that it is not the teacher’s job.\n\nIn summary, if possible, teachers have to avoid showing their personal perspective toward sensitive subjects like political or social affairs. This is because students are highly influential to teacher’s words and because teachers should concentrate on giving practical learning."', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

Furthermore, indoctrinating their cultures or languages to country that they successfully colonized is essential works because of forestalling the rebellions of colonized country. However, we are living in peaceful and cohesive society nowadays, so most of countries are competing with each other by showing their athletic skill or their unique style of art. If government should support one between them, they should endorse the arts rather than supporting the athletics. Supporting arts is not only teaching lesson about history and culture, but also it could promote the tourism.\n \n First and foremost, tourism is crucial task for countries to show their traditions and efficient way to afford the money. Furthermore, arts could enhance the tourism by showing the greatest work from famous painter or writer from the past, so it could expedite the stride of countries’ economy. Italy and England is perfect example of this case. Almost million people are dropping by these countries in order to appreciate or see the works of Leonardo da Vinci or William Turner etc. Furthermore, the visitor often purchases the monument of hallmark of the region. Throughout this process, countries are earning tremendous of money unless these greatest works are stolen by thief. The government can facilitate the money that they obtain from tourism by augmenting more public infrastructure or ameliorating the service of tourism. \n \n Most of art pieces reflect the life style of people in era that they involved and the tradition that people possess. For example, if one country suffered from colonizing of other country, the art works of colonized country would mostly show the dark or gloomy atmosphere, and sometime show their tradition stealthily. In contrast, the artworks from well-developed country could display the elegance and grace side atmosphere. When Korea was colonized by Japan, many ceramists were kidnapped and compellingly went to Japan in order to teach the techniques of making Korean ceramic. After Japan took a advantage of Korean ceramist, they killed the ceramist mercilessly. Therefore, the ceramic from colonized period show erratic and blunting surface, and most of them engraved Korean traditional painting.\n\nIn conclusion, arts is not only shows the tradition and culture of country, but also it could provide the many beneficial aspect.

INSERT INTO `tag_essay` VALUES(99, 2, 97, 1, '\nGovernment should pay attention to health care /not environmental problem', '"Many people argue that government should pay more attention to health care because keeping people healthy is more important than maintaining clean environment. Nonetheless, I strongly suggest that government put environmental problems before health care because reduced environmental problems can mean less health care burden for government and a large portion of environmental problems cannot be treated individually whereas people can individually care for their own health.\n \n First of all, if government pay more attention to environmental concerns, health problems will naturally decrease. Environmental pollution is one of the leading factors of disease nowadays. Therefore, if government increases its investment in environmental protection and enforces stricter laws, it can consequently cut its budget for health care.  For instance, if someone suffers lung cancer which is usually known to be caused by air pollution, this person will probably rely on government subsidies to receive expensive treatments. If government had paid more attention to regulating environmental pollution in the first place, government would not have had to spend a dime on this person. Consequently, government should pay more attention to environmental concerns as a long term solution to health problems. \n \nSecondly, environmental issues cannot usually be handled individually while each person can look after own health. Environmental problems are global concerns which require the initiatives of government. For example, the deforestation in Amazon is causing severe global scale problems such as global warming. However, there is a limit to what individuals can do to stop these without help of government. On the other side, health problems can be dealt individually by regularly exercising and maintaining healthy diet. There is nothing much government can do except for financially subsidizing patients. Having said all, government should prioritize environmental problems. \n \nIn conclusion, government should take environmental issues more seriously than health care because reducing environmental problems can be a solution to health problems and health care can be handled individually.\n\n"', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

While there are many good arguments for both positions, the following argument will explain in detail why I agree.\n \nMy first argument for the influence of people should be espoused. This is because people play critical roles in developing our untapped talents. Modern-day people live hectic lives because today''s globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. Consequently, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the fields of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for people to help us to develop our talents and tap into our full potential. Therefore, people'' influence cannot be overlooked in this context.  According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people who are under the close guidance of their co-workers and boss at their workplace decide on their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not. The majority of education experts argued that people are likely to be unproductive if they do not fully receive the advice and help of their peers and boss, especially when they are in their potential stages. \n \nMoreover, my strong support for people'' influence can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that people, with their years of experience, can offer lessons on morality and ethics. People who are not still mentally immature have long way to go before they become experts in their fields. During this long journey, they tend to make many mistakes and are prone to misbehave. However, people can be guided by their closer friends and mates, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms and can thus become good models for society. In this respect, people exert good influence on us. For example, undeveloped people may give in to the temptation of playing computer games allnight long because they are too immature to judge right from wrong. This is why others influence is an urgent need. With the guidance of people around us  such as co-workers or boss of us, we can learn how to avoid such temptations and become law-abiding citizens, by listening to our advisers'' descriptions of their own experiences. Through such lessons, we can become holistic beings.\n \nIn a nut shell, my discussion above presents two stronger arguments for people'' influence which I believe effectively convince the reader.\n "', '', '', '', '', 0, 0, 'essay', 'Tagging', 0, 0, '2013-12-13 13:14:51', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

As far as I am concerned, I am in complete disagreement with the argument. The two ideas can be sufficient evidence to support my disagreement.\n \nMy first argument for having excellent knowledge of a field for success in school or work should be espoused. This is because it helps us to be well-informed for success in school or work. While we grow up, we are exposed to certain types of the information and knowledge about the world, through education at work as well as at school. The problem with this is that most of the information and knowledge is conveyed from one source''s particular viewpoint. Given this, in order to be well-informed, we try to learn about different viewpoints from information through excellent knowledge of a field. In my case, I acquired information about space exploration by taking society class at university. Due to the class, I came to be fully exposed to the great achievements of governmental space projects. However, my perspectives on these governmental space projects could not be solely positive when I knew the difficulty of exploring space and huge budgets involved through doing my class assignments. Without these excellent knowledge of a field, I might have held a slanted view of what was going around me.\n \nMoreover, my strong support for broad knowledge of a field for success in school or work can be rationalized. This is attributed to the fact that it can allow us to get the latest information. Our world is evolving at a surprising speed. As a result, we may have difficulty understanding all of the changes and new events come about. Given this context, it is important that we try to keep current by learning changes and events through having excellent knowledge of a field. In a recent survey carried out by Harvard University, nearly two thirds of respondents felt that they could update their knowledge and successfully adjust themselves to the changing environments through having excellent knowledge of a field. According to the respondents, these broad knowledge prevented them from being confined to an outdated world. It is no surprise that there has recently been a drastic increase in the number of people who have excellent knowledge of a field to gain the latest knowledge of the world.\n \nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that people can become well-rounded and successful by having excellent knowledge of a field. By doing so, they can also avoid becoming biased and outdated for their success at work as well as in school.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.', '"Usually, libraries have been considered to be the yardstick judging academic width and richness of the universities. Even though facilities, systems and the amount of books in libraries have been considerably factored in by each college, athletic facilities and the importance of maintaining students'' physical health were not deemed to be significant. However, now is the time that universities equally fund athletic departments and libraries, since physical health is seriously interwined with mental health as well as academic motivation, and there are many learners who learn much more effectively during/after moving their body.\n \nFirstly, athletic department should be equally supported as library because funding support in athletic department can directly lead to improvement of university''s diverse extracurricular activities about exercise, and athletic equipment and facility, which will greatly benefit the whole students'' health. Since physical health hugely affects mental health and academic motivation, more funding for athletic departments will surely improve overall happiness and efficiency in learning. My friend was too obsessed with getting high score on the test once before, so she studied all days except for the meal time without moving her body. As a result, she sufferred from illness, as well as lost momentum in studying. Later, when she tried to regularly exercise, all the problems were solved.\n \nSecondly, it is said by the pedagogists that a type of learners learn more effectively when they move their body. It is very likely that this kinesthetic type of learners are more included in athletic departments than in other majors, and this can be a just reason claiming the need to fund the athletic departments to the equal degree with libraries, since both of them are there for the same reason: to facilitate students'' effective study.\n \nTherefore, universities should equally fund athletic departments and library because increased funding for athletic departments will enhance general athletic facility and exercise activity which will improve overall physical and mental health, as well as academic motivation of students, and kinesthetic learners will benefit from increased funding.
