When watching a series of comedies on TV in my livingroom, <TR>for instance</TR>, I could not be better than any other time. <TR>Also</TR>, I can relax myself while sitting on sofa and reading a kind of detective story.

Following this trend, some people argue that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside whereas others oppose such thought.
