It made me think about what kind of person I am.<br>It started with a little boy wearing a nice uniform walking into the backyard. He shouted proudly, ""I'm the best hitter,"" then he tossed the ball in the air and swung his bat as hard as he could. He missed the ball.<br>""Strike 1!""<br>Not hesitating, he tossed the ball once more and wielded the bat and- BANG! He missed it.. ""Strike 2!"" Then the boy paused for some minutes to carefully examine his bat and ball. He spat on his palms and rubbed them together as if he were a real professional baseball player. He straightened his cap and yelled triumphantly<ins>,</ins> <del>: </del>""I'm the best hitter on Earth<ins>.</ins>""<del>.</del><br>He tossed his ball and swung the bat. He missed it again. ""Strike three!"" he yelled.<br>He took a deep breath and he exclaimed with great satisfaction on his face, ""I'm the best pitcher after all!"" <br>After listening to this story, what comes to your mind<del> </del>? As for me, I burst out laughing and I asked myself, ""Can I think in the same way this boy does?"" To be honest, I'd be discouraged by this failure. However, the boy in this story didn't take it too pessimistically. Instead he chose to have a positive attitude. I admire what he said and the way he acted. He gave me a good lesson and a reminder that when one door closes<ins>,</ins> another door bangs wide open for us as long as we have a positive mindset.<br>Yes, I can't deny that everybody sometimes faces unpleasant and unexpected situations, such as getting a lower grade at school or arguing with friends. These things get us down a lot. Then, we immediately become miserable and begin to complain, <br>""Why can't I be as lucky or as popular as the other kids?""<br>You know what? This negative attitude won't make anything better.<br>Now, I have a question for everyone, ""How do you see the things happening to you- positively or negatively?""<br>Usually, we focus on the negative side, stopping ourselves from trying something <del>again </del>that is challenging<ins> again</ins>. Listen! The only difference between a failure and a success is how you react when you face the situation. Positive thinking is contagious and it leads to the ""I can do it attitude"" especially, when we are encouraging each other. <br>Just remember that everything you want to get and the person you would like to be depends on your attitude. If you believe this, just say what I say, ""Abracadabra, I will get what I think about. I can be whoever I want to be.""":::

She said,<br>""Your score was 10 and 9!""<br>I am really confused. I can't judge what is right. What do you think?":::
"139":::"My favorite book is Little Women. One day, I saw that story on the Little Fox website. I thought it would be very difficult for me, but it was very interesting! The author was Louisa May Alcott. She was born in America. She was the second <del>one </del>of four sisters. She was a little bit of a tomboy. Now, let's get into the story. I will introduce the four sisters. <br>First is,<br>MEG. She has brown eyes and brown hair. She likes beautiful things. <br>Next is,<br>JO. She is a little bit of a tomboy. She is good at writing stories. <br>Third is, <br>BETH. She is shy and quiet. She loves music. <br>Finally the youngest is,<br>AMY<ins> </ins>(ME?? My name is <mod target = amy>Amy</mod> and I am the youngest). She is cute and jealous of everything. <br>They become friends with a boy named Laurie. One day, their darling sister, BETH dies because of illness. But soon, the sisters forget about it and start a new chapter. MEG grows up and marries a man named John. JO continues her writing job. AMY grows up and marries LAURIE. Now, let's give a review of this book. I think this book is an excellent book. I want to give <ins>it </ins>5 stars. How about you?":::

I dislike the pictures because they are too simple. If I were to give a review of this book, I would give 4 stars for this book. Now, maybe I can become a writer when I grow up. I think that is possible because I like to read a lot. So, perhaps I can think about many good ideas. Now, let's think about what kind of stories I will write in the future. I want to write fantasy stories. I wish everyone can have their own stories.":::

Also<ins>,</ins> there was a watch and stickers. Vincent's box included the same thing as mine.<br>After finding the treasure by ourselves, I thought that even though it was scary to go in the dark to find the treasure in the rain, I was happy that Vincent and I were the ones to find the treasure.

My friends said that their crickets died. But my crickets are healthy and strong. I want to know how many centimeters crickets can jump. A cricket lives for about 1 year. It lives for 7 months as an egg, and 3 months as a caterpillar, and the last 2 months as an adult insect.

""Ahh..."" I was a bit ashamed because I never knew what one looked like before. Also, the crochet hook did not look like the hooks that I saw in my storybooks. It was a bit smaller. It didn't have a little ball at the end either. And the last difference was that the real hook is connected by a piece of rope, but the hooks in the storybooks never had this.

I felt very comfortable when I finished playing the violin. But not long after, I went to the church basement and got chocolates, tangerines, bread, and gloves. And then my sister sang in the <mod target = chorus>choir</mod>. And then my father did a praise and dance routine with other people's fathers. But my father almost didn't do the dance routine. He didn't move his body much while the other fathers moved their bodies a lot. So, my sister and I wanted to laugh.

"506":::"Wednesday, December 22nd, 2010, sunny day (family meeting time)<br><br>My family had a meeting three weeks ago (on Saturday) because my father told us to have a family meeting every week on Saturday or Sunday. He told us that we were going to have a meeting about what we have to do in <mod target = a>the coming</mod> week. We have to tell the family about three things or more. <mod target = Something that were>They had to be</mod> special. First, we have to write on a meeting notebook about <mod target = what>three or more things</mod> we have to do in <mod target = a>the coming</mod> week<del>, three things or more</del>. And then we would have a family meeting. My sister and I didn't want to have a family meeting because when we have a family meeting we cannot watch Gag Concert on television. I like Gag Concert, because it's very funny. Gag Concert starts at nine o'clock and ends at ten twenty five. But we finish the family meeting at nine thirty when we have a family meeting on Sunday. We did not have a family meeting on Saturday, because we forgot about the family meeting on Saturday. And we get tired when we have a family meeting. <br><br>Every week, we have a family meeting in the living room. So every week, <del>me and </del>my sister <ins>and I </ins>try to run away from the living room when my dad tells us to start the family meeting. But we could never stop the family meeting because my father said that we have to practice having <del>a </del>meeting<ins>s</ins>. My father said that I was very good when we had a family meeting. But my sister's manner<ins>s</ins> <mod target = was>were</mod> not very good during a family meeting. Instead, she looked very tired. So my father told my sister to ask a question to the person who was presenting about the week. Because she didn't ask many questions. I thought my sister had been very angry and tired about it. <br><br>Three weeks ago, my mother didn't attend the family meeting. Only <del>me, </del>my sister, <del>and </del>my father<ins>, and I</ins> had a family meeting. Maybe <ins>it was </ins>because <mod target = we>she</mod> didn't know that <mod target = my mother should>she</mod> also <ins>had to </ins>attend the family meeting with us, or maybe because she was very busy hanging the <mod target = wash>laundry</mod>. I thought that that's not fair. My sister thought that too. So the next week my mother also attended the family meeting with us. <br><br>Three weeks ago, my father had been the family meeting's first chairman. Then, two weeks ago, my sister had been the chairman. Then, last week, I had been the chairman, and then, <del>on </del>this Saturday or Sunday, my mother will be the chairman. And <del>on </del>next Saturday or the next day <del>(next Saturday's next day) </del>my father will be the chairman again. <br><br>When I was the chairman I said that I didn't want to be the chairman, because I thought that being the chairman would be hard for me. But my father kept saying that I should be the chairman, so I did. We set a table that was enough for my father, my mother, my sister and me on the living room floor. And we greeted each other, and used honorifics to each other because during the meeting, we have to use honorifics to each other. And the chairman would tell who will be first and who will be next by him or herself. That's the meeting procedure. And the chairman and some other <mod target = persons>people</mod> would talk about what each person did during the week. We <mod target = should>would have to</mod> tell them the meeting procedure. And after we tell them, the chairman would tell the others to ask questions. If they had a question, they would raise their hands and say that they have a question. And if they have no more questions, the chairman would tell the next person to tell everyone about what he or she did during the the week. If it was the last person to tell the others about what he or she had to do during the week, we would pay respect to each other and then the chairman would say that the family meeting was over. When we had finished the family meeting, we were very happy that my mother was there. It seemed that my mother didn't want to attend the family meeting like us. <br><br>I wonder if my father likes having <del>a </del>family meeting<ins>s</ins>. I think he doesn't like having <del>a </del>family meeting<ins>s</ins>. I wonder if my mother is comfortable when she is not at the family meeting with us. I think hanging the <mod target = wash>laundry</mod> is easier than having a family meeting. I wish that <mod target = one month later>in a month</mod>, we will not have family meetings anymore.

Before we went to the restaurant I didn't want to go to the restaurant, because I didn't want to be fat. Maybe I'm not fat to other people, but I think that I'm getting fat. So I didn't want to eat too much food. <br><br>At the restaurant there were many kinds of food that my sister liked. We went to a buffet. My sister loves buffets. We rode my father's car and went to the buffet. On the way to the buffet, I played my mother's mobile telephone game with my sister. It was very fun. The place where the buffet was is called Home Plus. Home Plus is a kind of shop. When we go to that buffet, it is as if we are going to Home Plus. <br><br>When we reached the buffet, I felt that it might have something fun. I think my sister was very excited when we reached the buffet.

So I could drink green tea when I was thirsty, and when there was no water. In that buffet there was no water. So I had wanted to drink water so much.

And there are many endangered fresh water fishes too, such as the siniperca scherzeri, fresh water salmon, hemibarbus mylodon, pseudopungtungia nigra, pungitius sinensis sinensis, cobitis choii, lampetra reissneri, and so on. <br><br>Some fish have been extinct so we cannot see those fish anymore.

We went to Mulhyanggi Arboretum<del>,</del> because<ins>,</ins> since I had a cold and so did my sister<del>,</del> (she still has a cold now)<ins>,</ins> we needed fresh air. And in Mulhyanggi Arboretum, there was a lot of fresh air. But I didn't want to go to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum<del>.</del> <mod target = Because>because</mod> I thought that place <del>called Mulhyanggi Arboretum </del>would be very boring. And my sister also had not wanted to go to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum. So, my father let <del>my friend </del>해영's family go to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum with my family. So<del>,</del> last Sunday<del>,</del> in the afternoon, we waited for my friend 해영's family to arrive at the church. And when they arrived at church, we rode in the car and <del>we </del>went to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum. <br><br>It was a little far from the church, but not too far. When we arrived at <del>the </del>Mulhyanggi Arboretum, we bought skewered chicken and two bottles of cold water. But I didn't buy the skewered chicken<ins> because I had no appetite</ins>. My older sister and <del>my friend </del>해영 bought it. <del>Because I had no appetite. </del>And besides, the skewered chicken was very long and we didn't have enough money. We first went to a hill and saw a pond <mod target = and the>as well as</mod> cattails, reeds, water lilies, flame grasses, water hyacinths<ins>,</ins> and lots of <ins>other </ins>kinds of plants that live in or out of the pond. And we accidentally saw one frog swimming in the water and went out to the water. I didn't see many frogs so I was amazed. We played with the frog with a stick and I said, ""Let's stop tormenting the frog."" And <del>my friend </del>해영 agreed. <br><br>Then we went inside some kind of small place, and in there, we saw beetles and stag beetles. I was amazed when I saw beetles and stag beetles because I had never seen them before<mod target = . Because>, because</mod> beetles and stag beetles in Korea are all endangered. While we were looking at something amazing, I began to get a stomachache. But I endured my stomachache. <br><br>We went somewhere inside and I saw a feature about the inside of trees. <del>My friend </del>해영 saw it too. The inside of the trees were all different. I was amazed by the inside of the trees too. Then, we saw a video that was about the four seasons. First, it was about spring<ins>,</ins> and many flowers had blossomed and bugs were flying in all directions. And then it was about summer. The grass was all green and more bugs were flying. And then it was about autumn. Things were all red and brown. And  the bugs, like red dragonflies, were flying. And then it was about winter. The trees' leaves had all fallen down and snow came from the sky. The snow covered the grass and <del>the snow </del>was on the tree branches too. And winter began to become spring and the snow all melted. And the video ended. <br><br>While we watched the video, I heard music. The music was very touching. I like touching music. After we watched the video, we went to other places where small animals were. We saw stag beetles again. And I saw another small creature that I didn't know. Then, we went to another place that was a hearing place. If I got closer to something that had a button and pressed the button, I could hear lots of sounds like water<del>,</del> and many kinds of birds and insects. These sounds were somehow amazing to me. I don't know why, but these sounds sounded good to me. But my stomachache became worse, so I asked my mother if there was a restroom. My mother found one and she told me to go to the restroom with my father. So, I went to the restroom with my father. But even though I went to the restroom<del>,</del> and tried to make my stomachache disappear, my stomachache didn't disappear. <br><br>In fact, I began to feel weaker than my family and <del>my friend </del>해영's family. We went to the Chinese restaurant and ate some jajangmyeon<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>sweet and sour pork<ins>,</ins> and so on. After eating, we went <del>to our </del>home. <br>I wish that I hadn't had a stomachache.":::
"514":::"Wednesday, October 20th, very cold. (Car)<br><br>The car, which is also called an automobile, is a machine that takes us where we want to travel. We use the car when we go to our relative's, <del>or when we go to </del>the museum, restaurant, airport, store, home, and so on. There are many people who have a car. But long ago, there were no cars<del>,</del> because <del>long ago, </del>there were no machines<ins>,</ins> and cars are machines. But in 1885, a man named Karl Benz (1844~1929) invented the car. But at that time, the car looked different from how it looks now. The seat was like a bench, and the wheels looked even bigger than now. <br><br>Only adults can drive cars, because children like me are too young to learn how to drive. People start to learn how to drive when they are in university. Cars have headlights, so when it is dark like night<ins> time</ins>, <ins>by </ins>using their headlights, people can see in front of the car and <del>can </del>drive more safely. And cars have wheels so they can move and drive. <br><br>There are many kinds of cars<del>,</del> such as battery-powered<del> cars</del>, natural-gas powered<del> cars</del>, solar-powered<del> cars</del>, water-powered<del> cars</del>, gasoline-powered<del> cars</del>, and so on. In our country, we use many natural gas and gasoline cars. Mostly, there are many natural gas cars and gasoline cars<del>,</del> because they are convenient. My father's car is a natural gas car. I have seen many gas cars and gasoline cars, but I haven't seen many battery cars. <del>Because </del><mod target = most>Most</mod> battery cars are used in golf courses. <mod target = The solar>Solar</mod> car<ins>s</ins> can move when it is sunny, because <mod target = the solar car>they</mod> use<del>s</del> <mod target = sun>solar</mod> energy. So<del>,</del> <mod target = when it is>on</mod> <del>a </del>rainy day<ins>s,</ins> <del>the </del>solar car<ins>s</ins> cannot move, because <del>when it is a rainy day, </del>there is no sun<ins>light during rainy days</ins>. But the good thing is that <mod target = the>those</mod> car<ins>s</ins> can move without any gas or <mod target = battery>batteries</mod>, and <del>it </del><mod target = is>are</mod> powered by nature (the sun). It takes a long time for a battery car to be charged<mod target = ,>;</mod> about 7-8 hours. <del>The </del><mod target = battery>Battery</mod> car <mod target = charges>are charged</mod> by being plugged in. And the water car<ins>s</ins> use<del>s</del> water to fuel the car<ins>s</ins>. Many people try to make a lot of battery cars and solar cars<del>,</del> because natural gas cars like my father's car and gasoline cars could destroy the environment. But battery cars and solar cars are environmentally-friendly cars. Natural gas cars and gasoline cars make smoke which is black<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>smells really bad<ins>,</ins> and could destroy the environment. But battery cars and solar cars do not make smoke. That is why natural gas cars and gasoline cars could destroy the environment and why battery cars and solar cars do not destroy the environment. But battery cars and solar cars are very expensive, because <mod target = it is>they are</mod> hard to make<del> them</del>. That is why there are many natural gas cars and gasoline cars, because they are cheaper than the battery cars and the solar cars. Making natural gas cars and gasoline cars is even easier than making battery cars and solar cars. <br><br>So, I wish that making battery cars and solar cars were not hard <mod target = and not>or</mod> expensive. In fact, the smallest car in the world is a water car. It is like a toy car, but if that toy car were<del>l</del> big like a real car, it might be a real water car. The water car is so amazing to me, because the water car uses water to move the car. I want to ride in a real water car. And I want to ride in a battery car and a solar car. And I wish that there were many battery cars or solar cars so the environment will not be destroyed. And I wish that using battery cars and solar cars were very convenient. I <mod target = wish>hope</mod> in the future, there will only be cars that are environmentally-friendly.":::

And since <del>the </del>winter is cold, when it is cold, I feel the coldness and it is fun.

That is why the leaves fall down, and in the winter, most of the trees will lose all their leaves. <del>And </del><mod target = my>My</mod> father and my birthdays are in the autumn too. My birthday is in November and my father's birthday is in August<ins>,</ins> according to the lunar calendar. My birthday is about one month later (November 10th). My birthday is in the autumn, almost winter. At that time it is very cold for autumn. That is why <del>the </del>autumn is almost winter. In autumn, there is Chuseok <mod target = for>in</mod> our country. It is on August 15th<ins>,</ins> according to the lunar calendar. Other countries that are in Africa or in cold places like the Arctic and Antarctica don't have autumn. Only temperate regions like Korea have autumn. <br><br>Autumn is the time to harvest rice. In Korea, long ago in the spring, the people planted rice<ins>.</ins> <mod target = and>And</mod> in the summer, the rice would grow with the weeds. So, during the summer<ins>,</ins> the people would pick the weeds. And when it was autumn, the people would harvest the rice. In autumn, <del>the </del>winter birds like wild geese come to Korea, while <del>the </del>summer birds like <del>the </del>swallow<ins>s</ins> fly away from Korea. The winter birds come to Korea when it is autumn in Korea, and they start their lives in the autumn and live in Korea until <ins>it </ins>begins to get warmer (during the spring). And then they go to another place that is cool. And summer birds return to Korea. And they start their lives in the spring and go to a warmer place when it is cold. But some of the birds live in Korea <ins>for </ins>all <del>of the </del>four seasons, like the sparrow and the magpie.<br><br>In <del>the </del>autumn, we wear long<mod target = -> </mod>sleeves and long pants. But if it is very hot, we wear short<mod target = -> </mod>sleeves and shorts instead of long-sleeves and long pants. And if it is very cold, we wear jackets. And the sky in autumn looks the highest, and looks even more blue, so I think that the sky in autumn is the most beautiful of all the seasons. I like to play outside in autumn<del>,</del> because autumn is cool, and summer is hot. And in the winter I will play with snow. I like autumn when the weather is sunny with a cool wind. I like to play outside during this kind of weather. <br><br>In the autumn, bugs like red dragonflies and so on start their lives. And in the autumn, the animals search for food, before the winter comes. Because, since the winter is very cold, during the winter there is no more food for them. Because the cold season makes the animals' food die or disappear. But not all of the living things that animals eat die. Some of the plants<ins>,</ins> <ins>like pine trees and fir trees, </ins>live even during <del>the </del>winter, even though <del>the </del>winter is very cold.<del> Like pine trees or fir trees.</del> <br><br>I am so lucky that I am a human. Because, in the autumn, the animals are busy every year. And humans have many foods even during the winter. So, humans don't need to be busy every year. Of course, humans have to study. <br><br>But nowadays, because of global warming, <del>the </del>autumn can be too hot, sometimes. And in September, people have to wear short-sleeves and shorts. Because, nowadays, the weather in September is very hot, like summer, even though it is autumn. So I am very worried about global warming. Global warming could melt the ice in the Arctic and Antarctica and the polar bears and the penguins would lose their homes. And because the ice would melt, whole islands would become flooded. And the typhoons and the rain would be stronger and <mod target = make>cause</mod> floods. <br><br>We should hurry to solve this problem.

"516":::"October 10th, Sunday, sunny (수련회)<br><br>From October 7th-8th, which was Thursday-Friday, I went to a retreat, because I had signed up to go there, just like all my classmates who are in class 1 of the fourth grade like me. And my other classmates in classes like class 2 and class 3 also signed up to go to the retreat like me and all my classmates. And not only the fourth grade was allowed to go to the retreat. The fifth grade was also allowed to go to the retreat. So, classes one, two, and three of the fifth grade also signed up to go to the retreat like us. <br><br>Before I went to the retreat, I packed the things that I would need <del>while I was at the retreat, </del>such as comfortable clothes, short<del>-</del>sleeve shirts, shorts, sandals, running shoes, socks, underwear, a towel, a sponge bag, some snacks, car sickness pills for nausea, and so on. <br><br>After I packed, I ate breakfast<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>brushed my teeth<ins>,</ins> and washed my face. <mod target = And>Then</mod> I changed my clothes, combed my hair, and <del>I </del>walked to school, carrying my bag that had everything that I needed for the trip. When I reached school, we waited to go to the retreat and <del>we </del>got on the bus, and we were on our way to the retreat. On the way to the retreat, we stopped at the rest area to go to the bathroom or buy something with our money. Then we were on our way to the retreat again. <del>And </del>I almost fell asleep because I was so sleepy. It took about two and a half hours to reach the retreat center. The place where we were going to play, sleep, and learn was grand and beautiful. <br><br>First, we heard from the headmaster about what we were going to do during the retreat. There were many teachers who would teach us and play with us. But these teachers were so scary that I almost wanted to go home. After we heard everything, we followed our headmaster to the cafeteria and ate lunch. And after we ate lunch, we went to the rooms where we would sleep, because the headmaster told us to put our bags in the room where we would sleep and change into short-sleeve shirts and shorts. So, we did as the headmaster told us<ins>,</ins> <mod target = and>then</mod> <del>we </del>gathered again and got in a cable car. <br><br>It was very fun.

Instead, I thought it was very fun. So did my friends (my classmates). But while we rode the cable car, our ears felt strange, because we had been in a low place and suddenly had gone to a high place. And after that, we played some games and after that, we rode a boat and we paddled with our teacher. We rode on one of three boats. The other two boats were for fourth<mod target = -> </mod>grade classes 2 and 3. After we rode the boat, we ate dinner<ins>,</ins> <del>and we </del>had a campfire<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>washed our hands and faces<ins>,</ins> and slept. <br><br>While I slept, my classmates heard me snore.

But I hadn't been dizzy when we were on our way to the retreat. <br><br>And then, when we finally reached the school, my teacher told us to rest for many minutes and to not go anywhere, because we were tired from going to the retreat and had to rest.

But<ins>,</ins> because the captain almost ruined the Admiral Benbow, Jim Hawkins' father was very upset and looked ill. So, late one afternoon, Dr. Livesey came to the Admiral Benbow to see Jim's father<del>,</del> as he lay down feeling ill. While Dr. Livesey told Jim's mother what to do, the captain was drinking lot of rum. Suddenly, the captain began to sing: ""Fifteen men on a dead man's chest, Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

After the fight, Billy Bones (the captain) ordered some rum, but when Jim returned with the glass of rum, Billy Bones (the captain) was lying on the floor. When Dr. Livesey came to see Jim's father, the doctor said that Billy Bones (the captain) had had a stroke, which is a very dangerous medical condition. Since Billy Bones was ill, Dr. Livesey and Jim carried him into <del>the </del>bed. But still, Billy Bones asked Jim to bring him some rum. But<ins>,</ins> Jim said no.

Then<ins>,</ins> they went off to Treasure Island (Jim Hawkins, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trelawney) with Long John Silver, who had lost his leg, Captain Smollett, and the rest of the seamen.

"519":::"Wednesday, September 15th, Sunny day <br><br>The violin is a string instrument<del>,</del> and string instruments are musical instruments. The violin has four strings. In fact, the sound comes from the violin's four strings. High and low sounds can be controlled at the upper end of the violin. Learning the violin is harder than learning the piano, so most children learn the piano. But, my mother especially wanted me to learn the violin, instead of piano. I first started learning the violin when I was eight years old (three years ago). <del>And </del>I first learned the violin at church. Then, I learned the violin at school. But<ins>,</ins> because I was so tired <ins>from </ins>carrying the heavy violin, I learned the violin at home<del>,</del> when I was nine years old. <del>And </del>I learned the violin at the music academy when I was ten years old. <del>And </del>I also started to learn the piano at ten years old<ins>,</ins> too (at home). When I had learned the violin at church, the violin was very hard to me. But, now, it <mod target = was>is</mod> not too hard <mod target = to>for</mod> me. But<ins>,</ins> vibrato is very hard <mod target = to>for</mod> me. Vibrato is shaking your hand while you play the violin. In fact, vibrato is the last part of learning the violin. So, I am learning the last part of the violin (vibrato). But<ins>,</ins> I haven't been learning vibrato for a long time. Maybe <ins>for </ins>one or two weeks? Anyway, my music teacher (the music academy music teacher) said that learning vibrato takes a long<del>~</del> time. About 1<mod target = ~> to </mod>2 years. So, I was a little disappointed because it takes a long time. <mod target = Because>That's because</mod> vibrato is very hard. Now, I am practicing how to do vibrato (shaking the hand like violinists). Maybe I'll finish learning vibrato when I am five years old<del>,</del> or six years old. I have seen only a few children that learn the violin like me. <del>And </del>I saw that they were at a lower level than me. Some children were learning only Do~ Rae~ Mi~ Fa~ So~ La~ Ti~. These were very easy <mod target = to>for</mod> me. But, I knew they were important<ins>,</ins> too. <del>And </del><mod target = some>Some</mod> children were learning 'Suzuki 2'<del>,</del> and I am learning 'Suzuki 4'! <br><br>The violin was first invented at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The violin was invented even later then the viola (the viola is almost the same as the violin, but bigger than the violin). The violin uses treble clef<del>,</del> and the viola uses alto clef. Koreans started to played the violin in 1910. In fact, long ago, the violin's bow looked like a bow that is used for archery, so the people called <mod target = itl>it</mod> a 'bow<mod target = '.>.'</mod> But nowadays, the bow is a straight line (it doesn't look like an archery bow, but people still call it a 'bow'). A violinist is a person who is good at violin. Of course, all violinists learn up to vibrato. Violinists have been learning the violin even longer than me. <del>And </del><mod target = they>They</mod> play the violin while doing vibrato. Doing vibrato with short musical notes (like quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes) is harder than doing it with long musical notes (like half notes, dotted half notes, and whole notes). <del>And </del><mod target = even to>Even for</mod> most violinists, it is very hard to do vibrato with short musical notes. So, my teacher in the academy said that she was also learning how to do vibrato with a short musical note. But<ins>,</ins> some violinists that are very, very good at violin can do vibrato with a short musical note. So, I want to be like those violinists (doing vibrato with a short musical note). I wonder how a violinist can do vibrato with a short musical note. I know many violinists have practiced many times<mod target = . And> and</mod> did not make mistakes. <del>And </del><mod target = in>In</mod> fact, I heard that when violinists hear themselves play, because the music is so beautiful<ins>,</ins> they close their eyes and appreciate the music and don't make any mistakes. So, I also want to play the violin with no mistakes like violinists. However, my dream isn't to become a violinist. My dream is to become a doctor. But, I want to be a doctor who is good at violin. <br><br>My mother said that if a patient listens to beautiful music, their illness goes away quickly. So, I want to play the violin for my patients<mod target = . So> so that</mod> their illness will go away quickly. To be that kind of doctor is my dream. I am very thankful for my mother. <mod target = Because,>That's because</mod> my mother made me learn the violin<del>,</del> and made me good at violin. When I was in<ins> the</ins> first grade and <del>in </del>second grade, I had hated learning the violin so much that I wanted to break the violin, but now, I changed my mind. So, I decided that I will not give up learning the violin. Because, if I give up, I will not be good at <ins>the </ins>violin. But<ins>,</ins> I want to be good at <ins>the </ins>violin. So, I will learn and learn up to vibrato. <del>And </del>I can't give up the violin. <mod target = Because,>That's because</mod> I am barely learning vibrato.":::
"520":::"Wednesday, September 8th, a little sunny and rainy<br><br>On Friday, September 4th at dawn, a typhoon passed through here (<mod target = GIONG-GI-DOE>Giong-Gi-Doe</mod>). So<ins>,</ins> while I was sleeping, I was awakened by the sound of the wind: the typhoon. I was so scared by that sound<del>,</del> that I went to my mother and my father's room and slept with my father. My mother was out at church (praying at dawn). When my mother returned from church, I awoke again. Then<ins>,</ins> I slept again. When I woke up again, it was morning. I ate breakfast<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>brushed my teeth<ins>,</ins> and washed my face. Then<ins>,</ins> I changed my clothes and combed my hair. Then<ins>,</ins> I walked to school. On my way to school, I saw a tree that had fallen during the typhoon. It was so amazing to me. <del>And </del><mod target = on>On</mod> my way home, I showed my friends the fallen tree. In Korea, the typhoon had first formed in <mod target = CHOONG-CHUNG-DOE>Choong-Chung-Doe</mod> (another province besides <mod target = GIONG-GI-DOE>Giong-Gi-Doe</mod>). So, the typhoon had gotten away from <mod target = CHOONG-CHUN-DOE>Choong-Chun-Doe</mod> and passed through <mod target = GIONG-GI-DOE>Giong-Gi-Doe</mod>. <del>And </del><mod target = on>On</mod> Friday, September 4th, in the afternoon, the typhoon had gotten away from <mod target = GIONG-GI-DOE>Giong-Gi-Doe</mod>. <del>And </del><mod target = it>It</mod> had gone to <mod target = GANG-ONE-DOE>Gang-One-Doe</mod> (another province besides <mod target = GIONG-GI-DOE>Giong-Gi-Doe</mod>). In fact, even though the typhoon had ended, the typhoon had formed in Korea again. But this time, the typhoon had not formed in <mod target = GIONG-GI-DOE>Giong-Gi-Doe</mod> again. It had formed in the south of Korea, in places like <mod target = JON-LA-DOE>Jon-La-Doe</mod>, <mod target = GIONG-SANG-NAM-DOE>Giong-Sang-Nam-Doe</mod>, or Jeju island, which is the biggest island in Korea. So, I was very relieved. In fact, not all countries call these storms typhoons. Only in the Pacific are they called typhoons. In the Atlantic<ins>,</ins> they are called hurricanes. <del>And </del><mod target = in>In</mod> the Indian<ins>,</ins> they are called cyclones. <del>And </del><mod target = in>In</mod> Australia, the Australian people call the typhoon wliywliy. On Friday, September 4th, a typhoon called Kompasu formed. Kompasu is one of the typhoon's names (the Japanese people named the typhoon). ""Kompasu"" means compass in the Japanese language. Here, Korean people have named typhoons: Kaemi (ant), Nari (lily), Changmi (rose) Sudal (otter), Noru (roe deer), Chebi (swallow), Noguri (raccoon), Koni (swan), Megi (catfish), and Nabi (butterfly). <del>And </del><mod target = in>In</mod> North Korea (I live in South Korea), the people have named typhoons: Kirogi (wild goose), Toraji (balloon flower), Kalmaegi (seagull), Meami (cicada), Meari (echo), Sonamu (pine tree), Podul (willow), Pongsona (garden balsam), Mindulle (dandelion), and Nalgae (wing). There are many kinds of typhoon names, I thought. Typhoons are so strong that they can break trees and trees fall because of the typhoons. In fact, in our country, three people died from the typhoon (Kompasu). So, I was so amazed<del>,</del> and surprised<ins>,</ins> too. I wonder how these people died from the typhoon (Kompasu). I thought that the people died because of the falling trees and streetlights. But, in fact, in the middle was the eye of the typhoon<del>,</del> where there is no wind, clouds, or rain. The eye of a typhoon could be up to fifty kilometers wide. Typhoons might be even stronger because of global warming. If the Earth had an even higher temperature, the typhoons could be even stronger<ins>,</ins> too. Because of global warming, the winds would be even stronger and there might be even more clouds<mod target = ,>.</mod> <del>and </del><mod target = the>The</mod> rains could be even stronger than before<ins>,</ins> too. That is why I think that we have to save the Earth, so there will not be as many Typhoons. I think that we have to save electricity. For example, I think that we should turn off the switch when nobody is using the light. Or, I think that we have to turn off the light<del>,</del> when it is bright<ins>,</ins> like in the afternoon. <mod target = Because,>That's because</mod> in the afternoon, the day is so bright, that we don't need electric light. <del>And </del>I think that we should turn off the computer when nobody is using the computer for a long time, like at night or <ins>at </ins>dawn. So, if we do all of these things, I think that there will be less typhoons. <del>And </del><mod target = if>If</mod> a typhoon forms and makes a flood<ins>,</ins> it is good to be ready by preparing food. We should prepare many food<del>s</del>, so we don't get hungry. Of course, we should also prepare drinking water<ins>,</ins> too. So, it is very good and important to be prepared. If not, we could starve during the floods<mod target = . And> and</mod> also<ins> get</ins> thirsty<ins>,</ins> too. We should wait <mod target = untill>until</mod> the flood ends.

Finally, I <mod target = will>would</mod> buy my favorite food, fruits! Fruits are good for your health. They have a lot of vitamins. So, I <mod target = will>would</mod> buy some fruit too.<br>Lastly, if I <mod target = have>had</mod> enough money, I <mod target = will>would</mod> buy a big house.

Even though<del>,</del> it's just a small amount of money, I think that is a good amount for me. <br>It was kind of my imagination but, I felt like it was real.":::
"564":::"One day, I dreamed of going to the theme park <mod target = on>for</mod> my birthday party. That was my wish. That is still my wish now. Can you imagine what I will do if my wish came true? Let me tell you about my great plan. The wonderful story begins.<br>Wowie! Wow! Wow! Can you guess why I am so happy right now? Tomorrow is my birthday. September 30th. My birthday is on September 30. <br>My mother and I are preparing for tomorrow's great party. Actually, it's not just a simple party. It's not at our house. It's not in a restaurant. I will have my 13th birthday<ins> party</ins> at the theme park. Wow! Don't you think it's really amazing? I can't wait! It is amazing! Zzz...<br>Ding- ding! It's morning. Wait... Oh! It's September 30th! My special birthday! I started to take a shower. I started to change my clothes into some very expensive and fantastic clothes. But, not a dress! <br>It's 10:00 A.M! My friends will be here soon. I invited more than 20 friends. What? Do you think it's too early for a birthday party? No! It takes more than<ins> an</ins> hour <del>from my house </del>to get to the theme park<ins> from my house</ins>! So, we have to be the fastest people in the world, just for today!<br>All aboard my car! Great~ Let's go! 30 mins... 40 minutes later... 1 hour later... 2 hours later... <br>Finally, we arrived! It is just the start of today's great plans.<br>We headed straight toward the Merry- Go- Round... We got on the ride without waiting. After a little time for the Merry- Go- Round, we went to ride a roller coaster. I was a little nervous<del>,</del> because it is only my second time riding a roller coaster! I squeezed my eyes<ins> shut</ins> and went on the ride... I did it~ I did it! <br>After going on some fun rides, we headed off toward the places where we could get some treats and sweets for lunch.<br>Since<del>,</del> it was a hot day, I bought some ice cream and some juice. My friends bought five bags of cheese popcorn and five bags of caramel popcorn. They bought a lot of cotton candy<ins>,</ins> too. Lastly, we all bought 10 slices of bread and 20 hamburgers.<br>Then, we went to the theater! You know, some theme parks have one or two theaters. Anyway, we watched a romantic and lovely movie<del>,</del> called ""Titanic<mod target = "".>.""</mod> <br>After that, we played near the theme park. Even <mod target = thought,>though</mod> it was a little cool, we were happy.<br>I said bye-<del> </del>bye to everybody. My mother and I were going back to my house now. Ah~ I had... a... really... really... fun and... exciting day...<br>Oh... I am... tired... Bye-<del> </del>bye to... you... too... Zzz...<br>What time is it? Is it early in the morning? Oh! Even though<del>,</del> it was my imagination and my dream, I felt it was really run. <br>What about you? How about you? Where do you want to go if you could?":::
"565":::"""If I could be on ANY game show, what would it be?"" Hmm… I think… I think… I want to… I want to… be on… be on… Hmm… Let me think for a while… <br>Oh! Yes! I thought of the perfect show. Can you guess my idea? Can you guess what I am thinking? Can you read my mind? Ha! Ha! Never mind. <mod target = Because,>That is because</mod> it's time for the answer, not questions. <br>""If I could be on any game show, I would want to be on Running Man!"" <br>I really want to be on Running Man and my wish might come true today! Wow! Wow! Wow! <br>I think… First, I will be the special guest for Running Man. <del>And </del><mod target = then>Then</mod>, the Running Man members and I will play the Running Man game. I want the simple version of the game. I don't want to play the special game for today's mission. There will be two teams for our game. There will be one team for the mission and another team to chase and catch. Maybe, I will be on the chasing team. I want to catch them and I would love to pull on and rip off someone's name tag. <br>I will be the winner. The chasing team or hunter team would be the winners. <del>And </del><mod target = the>The</mod> mission team will lose. Maybe, they did the best job they could, but our team was the best. This is what I would want to happen. <br>See you next week, bye-bye!":::
"566":::"Hi! Today, there will be another great adventure<del> soon</del>. At least<ins>,</ins> I hope so… He-he! Well, let's start my great adventure… Ding-<del> </del>ding. Ding-ding. My smartphone rang. (That's one of my biggest wishes! Oh~) It was Anna. Oh! You know what? Anna feels better now. <del>And </del><mod target = she>She</mod> can help us at my restaurant every weekend! Doesn't that sound great? I hope she doesn't get sick again because she is my best, best, best friend! <del>And </del><mod target = we>We</mod> take care of each other! Anyway, we talked for a while. ""Hi, Cindy. Um…Do you remember our first trip or adventure to the isolated island?""<ins> </ins>she said. ""Oh, yes! I think it was fun! But<ins>,</ins> why are you asking me that question? To answer? Ha!"" ""Oh, no… I want to… um… I want to travel again because it was really fantastic and fun. I hope you agree with me.The reason I am asking you is because the secret door is our <del>own </del>secret and you are my best friend."" Since she is my best friend and asked, I agreed and she was granted her first wish. <br>I found and opened the secret door with the secret golden key. I hope it will not take us back to the pirate. I don't like scary things. Anyway, Anna came and we crawled through the secret door. It was too small to fit both of us. Anyway, on the secret door a message appeared. It said, <br>""To the place where it is dark.<ins> </ins>But, be very careful. You might be in danger. Hold your friend's hand and you will be out of danger."" Oh… ""To the dark place where it is dark. Anna! Can you guess?"" I asked Anna. Anna shrugged.<ins> </ins>""Are you ready? If you are ready,<ins> </ins>say, 'I want to go there<del>.</del>' <mod target = And>and</mod> the great adventure will come true."" Another saying appeared from the secret door. ""We want to go there,"" we said together. The wind started to blow. The secret door started to move and spin. It spun faster, faster, faster<ins>,</ins> and faster. It was going as fast as possible. Then<ins>,</ins> everything was still<mod target = . Absolutely>, absolutely</mod> still and absolutely quiet. <br>We opened our eyes.<ins> </ins>Where were we? We were in a dark cave? Yes, it was a cave… Oh my… it was too dark to see anything. I hope<ins> </ins>it's another scary adventure! But, Anna's face was big~ She had a big smile! Oh no… She was too smiley. Anyway, back to the present. We didn't have much with us,<ins> </ins>except for our smartphones and clothes. So<ins>,</ins> we just decided to go deeper<ins> </ins>into the deep and dark cave. Suddenly, we heard a squeaking sound. What was<ins> </ins>that sound? It was another sound of<ins> </ins>danger. We saw the pirates and the pirate ship with our eyes last time. But, this time I heard something with my ears. How could that<ins> </ins>happen? It<ins> is</ins> our first time to hear the strange sound and it was making us scared. It seemed to get scarier. We<ins> </ins>looked up because that strange sound<ins> </ins>was coming from the top of the cave. Does that mean… Oh no… We might see <del>the</del>bats… And many bats… We looked up again. At<ins> </ins>first, we didn't see anything. But, this time it was different. There were many,<ins> </ins>many scary eyes… Oh… I wanted to<ins> </ins>get out of here… Anna was scared<ins>,</ins> too…I think this time seemed more dangerous<ins> </ins>because it felt like they would<ins> </ins>attack us in a minute. We held our<ins> </ins>hands together and said, ""It<ins> </ins>will be all right. You will be fine and okay.""<ins> </ins>Suddenly, the bats flew out of the cave. Even though it was <del>the </del>daytime, they<ins> </ins>flew. Isn't that amazing?<br>Wait, what's that<ins> </ins>now? We walked toward the strange sight. It was a bat. It was alone and it is trying to fly with its other friends. What was happening to him? I named her Batty. She is a bat. <mod target = AndI>I</mod> hope the bat likes the name. Batty<ins> </ins>was hurt. I think it was too hurt<ins>,</ins> so<ins> </ins>we decided to take her with us. When<ins> </ins>I went home with Anna<ins>,</ins> I <mod target = would>will</mod> fix her<ins> </ins>wings so that she could fly again. But<ins>,</ins> I was curious about why Batty couldn't fly in the first place and how she got hurt. Did<ins> </ins>she fight with her friends? Or did she break her little wings in an<ins> </ins>accident? But, how and why? <br>With these big questions I walked out of the<ins> </ins>cave. Suddenly, a letter flew inside the cave. We opened it and read it quickly. It said, ""Be kind and be nice. Try<ins> </ins>to understand the bat. <del>And </del><mod target = then>Then</mod>,your mission will be complete."" ""Be<ins> </ins>kind and be nice…"" said Anna. ""I think we should help Batty and keep her from<ins> </ins>danger. Ah! It is not our<ins> </ins>danger. It is her danger. She might die if she can't fly. If she can't<ins> </ins>fly, she can't eat and be with her<ins> </ins>friends. Oh no!"" Anna said once<ins> </ins>more. Anna is a genius! She understood<ins> </ins>the secret door's mission and saying. <br>We found a good spot to care for Batty. It was<ins> </ins>so nice. Batty kept squeaking and squeaking. Anna was trying to understand her<ins> </ins>and take care of her. I hope it worked… We hoped<ins> </ins>from deep within our hearts to help Batty. Oh my… and then I heard it! ""I<ins> </ins>heard! Yipee! I heard! I heard her problem, Anna! Isn't that amazing?"" I said<ins> </ins>with my excited voice! Yes! I did it. I understood Batty's problem and what she was saying. I know now! ""She was hurt by a sharp cave stone while she was flying! So, she couldn't use her<ins> </ins>wings and she couldn't go with her friends. I think she is really missing her friends!"" Anna clapped her hands. ""Wow, <del>and </del>now<ins> </ins>we have to fix her wings so that she<ins> </ins>can fly with her friends!"" <br>I searched my smartphone for help on how to fix animal wings. <del>And </del><mod target = there>There</mod> was something<ins> </ins>about bat's wings also! ""We need a band,<ins> </ins>something similar to a rubber band!<ins> </ins>But, how could we find it?"" Oh… I<ins> </ins>was disappointed until Anna found our first-<del> </del>aid kit! It was awesome! We quickly fixed<ins> </ins>her wings and let her go. <br>Our final mission<ins> </ins>ended! We were so glad that Batty could fly again and be with her friends! ""Bye-bye, Batty. I hope we can see you again next time!"" we said and<ins> </ins>left. We found the secret door <mod target = ofthe>in the</mod> cave where we had fixed Batty. We opened the secret door and went inside.<ins> </ins>""We want to go home…"" we said in our smallest voice. The wind started to blow.<ins> </ins>The secret door started to move and spin. It spun faster, faster, faster<ins>,</ins> and<ins> </ins>faster. It spun as fast as possible.<ins> </ins>Then<ins>,</ins> everything was still<mod target = . Absolutely>, absolutely</mod> still and absolutely quiet. <br>We were back. I hope we will have another great adventure again soon!":::
"567":::"Hi<ins>,</ins> there! Did you have a good time? We meet each other again! I am happy to be with you. <del>And </del><mod target = now>Now</mod> I have something to tell you. It is something really special!<br>Two days ago, I started my own restaurant. It is a very small restaurant… Whew! I got a lot of money (but, I wasn't the world record holder). Did I open my own restaurant by myself? No! Well, it's mine. But, my best friend Anna helped me. She decorated the restaurant, made the menu, bought the things that I needed for <ins>the </ins>restaurant, and settled things such as chairs, tables, and dishes. I'm not sure. I just bought the place for the restaurant and Anna did almost everything. I just looked at her and I did rest a lot… But, I think I am not a lazy girl. I am the owner of this restaurant and I will be a busy person soon.<br>Oh… I didn't tell you my restaurant's name. I actually didn't know what to name my restaurant at first. But<ins>,</ins> I knew I had to. That was my first<ins> job at the</ins> restaurant<del> job</del>. I <mod target = said to>told</mod> you that I will become a busy person soon. <del>And </del><mod target = that>That</mod> means now! <br>What could be my restaurant's name? I needed the perfect restaurant name… I <mod target = though>thought</mod> of Cindy's Restaurant, Sweet Restaurant, Beautiful Restaurant, Perfect Day Restaurant, Teddy Restaurant… Ah! I hoped it could be <ins>called </ins>Perfect Day Restaurant. <mod target = Because>This is because</mod> I hope everything goes fine and perfect! <del>And </del>I could change my restaurant's name at any time! <br>Yesterday, I called my friends, including Anna. I think she is like my family. I asked my friends if they could help me for a while. I said to them that I would reward them well! Of course, with money~ Ha! They all agreed with me! Everyone, except for Anna. She was sick and she is actually still sick even now. She couldn't help me. I was sad. She was sad. We were all sad because Anna is our best friend! Anyway, with a great smile and great hope<ins>,</ins> we started our restaurant. I hope that I <mod target = would>will</mod> not be the owner of this restaurant! Everyone, I mean<ins>,</ins> my friends<ins>,</ins> all are restaurant owners and good helpers. Yipee! Now, my Perfect Day Restaurant begins!<br>Now, it's time to sell our food and make some money. I am glad that we are all friends and can help each other! Janny and Mike cleaned up the floors and the whole restaurant, including the desks, tables, and kitchen. Ha! It seemed perfect even though it's only the beginning! Amily and Susan set up the tables. They put down the spoons, forks, knife, cups, and the Menu! Emily and Jack wore the restaurant's uniforms and their job was to greet the guests. So, our restaurant <ins>crew </ins>members are Amily, Emily, Susan, Janny, Mike, Jack, Anna, and me! There are eight members! Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, not now<ins>,</ins> since Anna is sick. Anyway, I didn't tell you about my job! I am the head of our friends and I am <ins>the </ins>leader of our great members. I calculated the money, such as how much the customers or guests ate<del>,</del> and sat at the office desk! He… He…<br>Ting! Ting! Our first customer has arrived! Wow! Wow! Wow! It's fantastic! We have to treat our customers well! It was a girl! She was very cute and came with her mother! <br>""Please sit here<mod target = ,>.</mod> <mod target = since>Since</mod> you are our first customers<ins>,</ins> we are going to treat you well and you can choose one thing for free."" Emily and Jack said at the same time. ""Oh! You are such good greeters! How lovely! <mod target = It's>It</mod> just fits so well with your restaurant's name, Perfect Day. I hope you will do well! I like this place! I will recommend this restaurant to my friends and other people that I know!"" the cute girl's mother said to us. I felt great and perfect! I felt like we were having the perfect day like the name of our restaurant! Ha! <br>Thirty minutes later, there were more and more customers! Soon, our seats were full and most of the customers had to wait for a few minutes. I was really happy! <del>And </del><mod target = my>My</mod> friends were happy<ins>,</ins> too. But, we were all busy at the same time! <br>After all the customers enjoyed our food<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>paid the money to me<ins>,</ins> and left, we all felt great and happy<ins>,</ins> so we rested for a while. It was almost dark! But, our jobs weren't done! We had to clean and design more! We painted and bought some bright lights. After a few more hours<ins>,</ins> it's almost midnight and our restaurant was really, really, really fantastic and wonderful. We were all successful! Wow! Wow! Wow!<br>It was almost midnight! <del>And </del><mod target = it>It</mod> was time to go home! I hope I will have<ins> a</ins> sweet dream. I want to say good-bye to you<ins>,</ins> too! Good midnight! Ha! I think my friends and I<ins>,</ins> and even Anna<ins>,</ins> could work harder than we did today. Tomorrow will be my great day<ins>,</ins> too<ins>,</ins> like today!<br>See ya!

"568":::"I don't have a favorite superhero… Um… Let me think! Ah! Spiderman! He is not my favorite superhero. But, he was a good hero in the movie~ Ha! Ha!

I think he is kind and very powerful. But, I don't want to have his power. The reason <ins>for that </ins>is that I don't like webs and spiders. Also<ins>,</ins> I had a bad accident with a web!!!! Even though I know about Spiderman, I didn't watch the movies. The movie was not fun and exciting for me. My mother said, ""There are many movies about Spiderman.""

"569":::"Hi, my name is Cindy and I had fun for a while. You know about my great dinosaur, right? <del>And </del><mod target = this>This</mod> is my next journey to a scary place and the beginning of a new story. <br>One great morning, I woke up and it was 8 o'clock. I had my best friends. You probably think that you should only have one best friend. But, not this time. I have three best friends: Teddy, Huggy, and Uppy. Huggy is from the internet. Actually, it's the character of Skype. Anyway, I have another one! Ha! I have many, many, many best friends. Anna is another one of my best friends. <br>Today<ins>,</ins> we were going to meet each other and we <mod target = are>were</mod> planning on going for a hike. We are going to a smaller mountain! The mountain is not hard to hike up or down! Oh! I will not take Uppy and Teddy. I also couldn't take<del>,</del> Huggy because<del>,</del> I couldn't bring computers to the mountain in my small bag. Anyway, the time came and I got busy.<br>Then<ins>,</ins> my phone rang. It was Anna. She said, ""Hey Cindy. I don't think I can go hiking with you today. I think I am a little sick. I might have a cold. So, I hope that if you are okay with it, we can just stay at your home and talk."" Of course, I said, ""Okay,"" because I am perfect and I am always happy if I can stay with my friend, especially with my best friend. <br><del>And </del><mod target = suddenly>Suddenly</mod>, I saw something behind my closet. I was trying to find clothes to go hiking with my best friend and then, I saw it. It was a door! It was a small door that I could get inside. But, the door was locked and I <mod target = have>had</mod> to find the key. <br>Ding-dong! Ding-dong! My door bell rang. My best friend came! Wow! She came very quickly! Anyway, I told Anna about the secret door and now we were looking for the secret key. We looked everywhere but, we couldn't find it anywhere. We just found a lot of dust under the bed, in the closet, and on the floor. Then, I looked up while stretching. Oh, what's that? It's a golden key! Hey! Now, I found it! Yay! We unlocked the secret door and… … … … … … … … … … whoosh! A message appeared, ""To the great place where you can find treasure…"" I read. We looked at each other for a while and we went inside the door. ""Wow… Where is this place? I want to go there! I want to travel there! How great!"" I muttered. The wind started to blow. The secret door started to spin. It spun faster, faster, faster, and faster. It was going as fast as possible. Then<ins>,</ins> everything was still. It was absolutely still and absolutely quiet. But, only for a while <mod target = and>before</mod> a great wind started to blow again. Then, a bright light appeared. <br>I woke up. ""Where am I now?"" I wondered. I was with Anna. Whew! I felt dizzy. Whew… It was such a great imagination and also a great dream. It was an adventure dream. I stood up. I opened my two eyes. I woke up my friend. I think… we were on an isolated island. It was an isolated island! It was <mod target = the>a</mod> great place where I could find treasure. Wait! Island and treasure… Those two words are often linked with pirates! Ah!! Oh! No! ""We have to get out of here!""<br>I could see that something was coming toward us and it was a pirate ship. The pirates grabbed us and now we were on the pirate ship. They were saying something but, I couldn't understand because<del>,</del> it was in their own language. I couldn't believe it! We were on a pirate ship? It was a real pirate ship. Oh my… <br>We had to get out of there. <del>And </del><mod target = we>We</mod> had to go home. We explained<ins> about</ins> what had happened and they just laughed and laughed for a long long time… Why were the pirates so foolish? I don't know… Anyway, I dreamed of a pirate when I was my younger sister's age because I wanted to get treasures like pirates do. But, not now. I think the pirates were too foolish to get something from the island. They have to be smart like my best friend, Anna, and me! HA! <br>We muttered and stood up. We were good at exercising even though I actually don't like to exercise. Ha… ha… Anyway, we did some Taekwondo. The pirates all ran away or else they <ins>would </ins>have to become our slaves. So, we got home safely. We found the secret door on the isolated island. It was in the tallest palm tree. We opened it with our secret golden key and we said, ""We want to go back to our own home. We want to go home!""<br>The wind started to blow again. The whole palm tree started to spin. It spun faster and faster. Then<ins>,</ins> everything was still. It was absolutely still and quiet. <br>Wow! We were back! Hmm… It was a great adventure! <del>And </del>I am glad and also surprised that <mod target = is>it</mod> was not a dream! <br><del>And </del><mod target = we>We</mod> talked about our great adventure. <del>And </del><mod target = the>The</mod> time went by quickly! <br>Bye-bye and I hope that the other great adventure will start soon!":::

I know you want to know<ins>,</ins> so the amazing, amazing, amazing story <mod target = is starting>starts</mod> now. Listen carefully. <br>One summer night, I was really tired because of my students from school. I took a shower. I brushed my teeth. I changed from my clothes into <ins>my </ins>pajamas.

I was glad that I don't have my own child yet. It would be harder if I had my own child or children... Anyway, I slept and I dreamed the most exciting dream ever! It was not about Running Man<del>,</del> or visiting my favorite cousins and relatives. It was the best dream I have ever had. In the <del>best </del>dream, my students were listening well during the classes and I saw that I would be beautiful forever. Ha... Ha... <br>Click-clock! Click-clock! My first noisy alarm rang.

My second noisy alarm rang. Oh... I turned it off again. This time I did it slowly. I slowly turned off my second boring and noisy alarm. What time was it? Oh, it was 7:30 am! Oh my... It was almost time to wake up for the weekday! But<ins>,</ins> it was not the right time to wake up during the weekend! Uh... I was too tired to open my eyes. But, I still knew where my boring and noisy alarm was because I turn it off every day. Always! <br>Gangnam Style~ Oop! Oop! Gangnam Style~ Umm~ Sweet sound. Sweet music. The sweet alarm bell. My final sweet and cute alarm rang. Gangnam Style is still popular and PSY is still popular nowadays<ins>,</ins> too! I woke up and looked at the time. It was 9 o'clock. Of course<ins>,</ins> <mod target = am>A.M.</mod>. Oh, it's time to wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Sleepyhead! <br>I quickly headed to the bathroom to wash my face, <mod target = brushed>brush</mod> my teeth, and <mod target = took>take</mod> a shower. I <mod target = had>have</mod> to wash my face after I wake up because if I don't wash my face after waking up, I can look like a zombie teacher. <br>Wait! Wait! What was that?

I rubbed my eyes and looked again through my window. ""It IS a dinosaur!"" It's good that there was a dinosaur<mod target = . Right>, right</mod>? Anyway, I went straight to the bathroom, changed my clothes, ate my breakfast quickly<ins>,</ins> and then, I saw it again. I was relieved that the dinosaur was a plant eater. It was a herbivore. How did I know? I am a kind and smart girl. <br>Anyway, I thought for a while that I should tell the police. But, I knew that they (the police) would kill or catch the dinosaur and that the dinosaur would be unhappy. I thought I should make the dinosaur smaller and keep it as a pet. It would be a new pet. I really wanted a pet, especially a dog, but now I didn't want one anymore. I just wanted the dinosaur. <br>I walked to the dinosaur. I walked very slowly. The dinosaur didn't see me. That was good. I gave him some plants. <del>And </del><mod target = he>He</mod> loved it! Oh! I really like him! My lovely pet! He didn't seem scary anymore and it's good that nobody had seen my cute dinosaur yet.

But<ins>,</ins> you can't use that forever. I wouldn't be able to spend, buy, or use the money. Money is a useless thing on a deserted island. Can you take a shower with money? Should you make a fire with money? No! Money is just for selling and buying things. I am a smart girl~ Ta-<del> </del>da! Ka!

The word ""notebook"" has very different meanings in Korea and America. Anyway, I would take a notebook, a small computer, for communication!

"574":::"I have many fears<mod target = . But> but</mod>, I have one that is worse than the others. Do you know what it is? Maybe when I tell you what my greatest fear is, you will laugh, especially the boys. Well, I have to tell you now! One day I was going to the country<ins>side</ins> with my family. We were going to Icheon where the pottery is very famous. We rode the bus because Icheon is very far from Seoul. When the bus arrived in Icheon<ins>,</ins> we got off the bus and just stayed there. We had to find the way to the pottery factory. While we were standing there, my younger sister suddenly shouted, ""Hey! What is that?"" I looked down and saw that there was an insect on my leg. If it was a fly or a mosquito<ins>,</ins> I would have just shaken my leg because they are very small insects. But, sadly it was a grasshopper. Unfortunately, it was about the size of <ins>one of </ins>my <del>one </del>fingers!!!! Uh....... I didn't know what to do in that situation! So, I called my mom! I yelled, ""Mom, mom, mom, mom!!! Help me! Please!"" However<ins>,</ins> my mother said, ""What?! That's just an insect. You can kill it by yourself!"" Luckily, when I shook my leg, it hopped away! Do you like insects or bugs? I don't like them. I really don't like them! Oh! I have another story about one of my fears! It happened in Busan. While I was playing with my cousins, I ran between the trees. In between the trees, there was a web! Can you guess what happened next? Well, the web became attached to my face and clothes. Luckily, It was not a bug! I am a human! Also, there were flies on the web but no spiders! For me it was a bad day and also for the spider, but it was a lucky day for those insects! What is your greatest fear?":::

"576":::"I watched many movies<del>,</del> and I like most of them. But, the best movie I saw was ""Hairspray<mod target = "".>.""</mod> I watched this movie last month with my friends. This movie started with <mod target = songs>singing</mod> and dancing. The main character was a very fat girl. She liked dancing and singing, but she didn't like studying. One day, she slept during class. So, the teacher wrote a message and sent her to the other class. The other class was very noisy<del>,</del> because they weren't studying. Instead<ins>,</ins> they were dancing and singing to happy songs. That place was where the bad students who didn't concentrate in <del>the </del>class went. The girl decided to join the dancing club. She had a dream; the dream was dancing and singing in the hairspray advertisement. Finally, she was able to be a part of that advertisement with the boy who was also in the hair<del> </del>spray advertisement. This was the summary of the movie. Before I watched this movie, I had another favorite movie. That movie was the story about the love between a human, vampire<ins>,</ins> and<ins> a</ins> werewolf. But, now ""Hairspray"" is my favorite<del>,</del> and it is the best movie I've ever seen. I think I like the songs and dancing in this movie the most. I don't like movies that seem like a concert with dancing and singing. But, strangely I liked this movie. I don't know why, but I want to recommend ""Hairspray"" to other people who <mod target = didn't>haven't</mod> watch<ins>ed</ins> this movie yet. Maybe they will like this movie<ins>,</ins> too.

Well, I really don't like to do the dance because some of the letters are very funny but, very difficult too.

"639":::"Last Friday was the beginning of the second half of the 5th grade. I was happy to be back at school. I met my friends and my teacher. We were all loud during our break talking about what we did over our summer vacations. During class, the teacher picked some students to share about what they did during their summer vacation. I was picked. I said that I went to the Jangan Sea and swam in the water during the day, and went to catch some clams at night. Ju-Young said that he went somewhere and played games with his cousins. Hannah told us that she went to Dae Myong condominium and played table tennis with her dad and her brother. After we listened to some of our other friends' stories, our teacher said to remember them well. At first, I didn't understand. However, when we finished eating lunch in the cafeteria and we came back from lunch break, we played two games. They were the consonant quiz game and BINGO<del> game</del>. We played the BINGO game first. Then, I realized why our teacher said to rememer what the other students did during their summer break because on the paper, there were boxes and inside the boxes, there were instructions like, ""Take out a piece of hair and give it to a student who had a haircut and get a <mod target = sign>signature</mod>."" If you <mod target = had>got</mod> BINGO three times, you had to line up at the front of the class. I did not get three <mod target = BINGO's>BINGOs</mod> so I didn't get a prize<mod target = . But>, but</mod> it was okay. There was another game left for me. It was the consonant quiz. There were group questions. We answered the questions that had <mod target = the>a</mod> hint using only certain consonants. Some were hard but others were very easy. We got a little ball if our group answered the questions correctly. The winning group had five little balls but we only had two balls. So, we were almost in last place. However, there was a benefit to being almost last. There was <mod target = a>the</mod> chocolate that Eun-Seu <mod target = gave>had</mod>. She got it in Russia.<del> But</del> <mod target = there>There</mod> were only two big <mod target = chocolate>chocolates</mod> so our teacher broke it. However, <mod target = people cannot>she could not</mod> break the chocolate into the same size pieces so there were some chocolates that were small and some that were big. Also, there were some that had almonds inside the <mod target = chocolte>chocolate</mod><del>,</del> and some that did not. The winning teams got other presents like stickers. The losing teams did not have anything so the teacher said that the team that had the most balls among the losing teams got to pick the chocolate they wanted first. We were the second group to get the <mod target = chocolte>chocolate</mod>. Min-Yeong used to live in Russia so she had already eaten a lot of <mod target = Russia>Russian</mod> chocolate. She refused to eat the chocolate. I was happy to eat the chocolate. I chose the chocolate that had no almonds inside because I really, really hate almonds. It was just a small piece of chocolate but it was delicious. Today was the first day of school so it was fun. I hope <mod target = everyday>every day</mod> in school will be like today where there is <mod target = lots>a lot</mod> of playing and laughing.":::

So<ins>,</ins> my sister and I went to the swimming pool. My sister can't swim, even with a flotation device. I can swim with a life jacket or a tube.

She went into the big pool with me and practiced swimming. I played with my friends in a boat. I thought that my sister might be bored because she couldn't swim well. Also, the water was cold in the big pool and the water was not cold in the small pool. So<ins>,</ins> I went to see my sister. She was practicing more and more. I called her into the small pool and I taught her to do the backstroke. At first, she refused to learn. However, she finally agreed after seeing my friend do it. Although she still couldn't do it alone, she was now much better at swimming. I held her body to make her float. But<ins>,</ins> I think she would have floated on her own. However, she said to hold her tightly and I promised I would, so I didn't let go of her.She looked scared, but I didn't understand why. The water is not deep and she could easily stand in it.

I went to the airline, physical therapy, beauty shop (hair salon), military training camp, and 119 safety center rooms. The first place I went to was the airline room. There were two different jobs that I could choose from. I chose to experience the pilot. We first got used to controlling the handles <mod target = with>while</mod> looking at the screen and following the pink cross line. Next, we went inside a training plane and learned how to handle some other things. The exciting part was next. We practiced what the pilots and stewardess do when there is a problem inside the plane. There was an air bounce outside. We stretched out the arms and went down. I was a fast slider. Now, the second place I went to was the physical therapy (pt) room. We divided into pairs of two. The first time, one person act as a physical therapist and the other person acts as a patient. Next, we switched places. It was not very fun<ins>,</ins> but I still learned many things. The third job was at the beauty shop or hair salon. There was a mannequin that had hair. Also during this experience, we divided into groups. I designed the mannequin's hair with a middle school student. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be. Afterwards, I went to the military training camp. This looked a little boring when I first started and I was right. We used a K2 gun to play a gun game. The gun was very heavy. I was exhausted. Also, I walked around with toy guns. The last experience was the 119 safety center. We learned how to do CPR when a person cannot breathe. It was not real<ins>,</ins> but we did some first-aid treatment to the mannequin.

Math was not so hard<ins>,</ins> but I might have made a mistake so I had to be very careful or I might get many problems wrong. I checked everything over two times. However, I was still not sure that I got everything right. Next thing was social studies. Usually, social studies is easy so I did not worry a lot. Other students did not worry about it either. Then, the social studies test was in front of me. It was very easy. I had a lot time left. I was sure that I would get many of them right. The final test was science. Science was a little bit complicated<ins>,</ins> but not too hard. It was a little harder than the social studies exam. It seemed like there were many questions.

"649":::"There are many types of natural disasters. There are blizzards, tornadoes, and earthquakes. First, a blizzard is a snowstorm that causes many problems.

People have to go underground. If you don't see anywhere to go underground, go inside a safe building. That is probably safer than wandering off outside.

We can go outside and have a snow fight with our friends during lunch time. There is plenty of time to play outside.

Usually, many families will go to their relatives' houses<del>,</del> or go to their grandparents' house and have a great time.<ins> </ins>But this year, our family spent New Year's <mod target = day>Day</mod> differently than we have before. Instead of going to another place, we just stayed home. But<ins>,</ins> I think it was better than any other New Year's <mod target = day>Day</mod> that I've celebrated! <br>When I woke up, it was really different. Our family is always really busy in the morning because we need to get ready to go to our grandparents' house and take stuff. But today, it felt like just another regular day.

Today, I decided that we can just stay home and do something else. It can be fun to do something new."" <br>So, we studied for a few hours. We were still frustrated that we weren't going to our grandparents' house. Then, mom allowed us to watch some movies. We watched the ""Simpsons"" and ""Harry Potter."" I felt like something was wrong because mom never allows us to watch movies. It was really fun, so we watched the movies for about <mod target = 3>three</mod> hours. I wish I could watch them again now, but mom put those things away immediately so that we can't see where she keeps them. We ate pizza for dinner. It was really good to see our whole family eating pizza together. Father and my brother came late because of their work. But<ins>,</ins> no one said a word because everyone was concentrating too much on eating. <br>Well, it was different from the way we normally spend New Year's <mod target = day>Day</mod>, but it was still really fun.":::

We arrived at Daemueng Vivaldi Park. We were surprised at the size of the resort<del>,</del> and there was also an Ocean World. But<ins>,</ins> because of the cold temperature, we couldn't ride the slides which are connected to the outside of the camp. We ate lunch at the lodgings<del>,</del> and went outside. It was all covered with snow! <br>We skied for <mod target = 4>four</mod> hours a day. Our teacher taught us how to ski faster and more smoothly. Not just that, but he also told us how to ride safely. ""Safety is the most important thing when we are skiing,"" he said, and I also agree with him. But, I can't enjoy the feeling when we are riding a lift. When I see the ground, I can't even move. It is really scary. When I saw the sky, my body almost fell out of the lift, so I couldn't see anything. It was really fun when we speed up and move up and down. The boys in our group always went downhill when teacher was not watching them. When you go downhill, you go so fast that it is almost impossible to stop. I tried once, but it was too fast for me. <br>At night, we went to <del>the </del>Ocean World. But<ins>,</ins> my friend said she will not go because she hates swimming. So, I just played by myself for thirty minutes<del>,</del> and I met my friends in the lodgings and played with them for <mod target = 2>two</mod> hours. It was really great! Except<ins>,</ins> there were two girls who kept using swear words to others and grumbling. They also pushed me when I was sitting on the lift. <br>The second day, we went skiing for <mod target = 4>four</mod> hours again. Our group divided into two teams because there were too many people. There was a boy who was really rude to the girls. So, the oldest girl scolded him. It was really delightful to watch. At night, we went downstairs and rode some things like the merry-go-round. But<ins>,</ins> there were only PC rooms so most of the girls just went back to the lodgings and watched TV. <br>Then<ins>,</ins> it was the final day. I really miss the place now.

"671":::"Today, I went to <ins>a </ins>science academy to learn about different subjects you learn in middle school: natural laws, chemistry, biology, and earth science. Today, we learned about earth science. <del>And </del><mod target = because>Because</mod> of ski camp, I came on Monday for <ins>a </ins>make-up lesson. There were three boys in the class and they looked at me like an animal in the zoo. They asked me some questions and one boy said, ""Well, you are different from those tattletale girls. You can be in our group."" What on earth they were talking about? They talk like they are in some kind of secret organization. But<ins>,</ins> they all looked nice and funny. <br>We learned about rocks. At first, I thought everything was the same and that rocks are boring. In society, we often call a person who is stupid ""rock head."" So<ins>,</ins> rocks are usually associated with a bad meaning. But now, I think rocks are really important to us. A long time ago, all the continents were united. But, because of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, they broke apart. After the volcanic eruptions, the magma started to get solid. Then, many rocks like granite emerged. There are three general kinds of rocks: igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks, and sedimentary rocks. Other things are also related to their names. For example, sedimentary rocks are made by the layers of solid rock that have become stuck and joined together because of heavy pressure. Then<ins>,</ins> we learned about how to tell different rocks apart. For example, if we can scratch rocks on<br>a streak plate<del>,</del> and it draws a line, it has a weak hardness according to the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. But<ins>,</ins> when the streak plate gets scratched, that rock<ins>'</ins>s hardness is strong. I really learned a lot today!":::

Even my active sister was just waiting quietly. But, everything changed because of the mission. <br>When we arrived at the rest area, we had to take a photo of five people levitating (that means to take a direct picture of people jumping), take a ghoulish photo of someone, and solve nonsense <mod target = quizes>quizzes</mod>. It was really hard. We were not friends at first, but after taking pictures, we were busy talking about how to complete our mission.

I tried it on and it fit perfectly! So, we bought the T-shirt and also went to another shop to buy my sister's sneakers. After she chose her sneakers, we went home. <br>We put out everything we bought at the store. Most of them were my sister's. I bought only the gray T-shirt. I will wear that shirts in the summer.

 participated in four events. The first was the competition between the 
blue team and white team (봉넘기 게임) which was only for the fifth grade. 
The second was the 100-meter race. The third was the preliminary class 
relay race. The fourth was the final class relay race which you can

 waited for lunch. I was curious to know if the snow had already melted 
or not. I went to the veranda and looked out. The snow on our school's 
playground melted a lot! I was so shocked! I didn't know it takes <mod target = that little>such a small amount of</mod>
 time to melt that huge mass of snow! I thought when the time reaches 
1:30, all the snow might melt! So, I hurried to the phone, and dialed 
Alice's number. She said she will come outside at 1 o'clock. <br>After I
 ate lunch, I rushed to my room and got my warm clothes, gloves, hat, 
and scarf. I started walking to the playground at 12:50. When I arrived 
there, Alice was nowhere in <del>my </del>sight, so<del>,</del> I just played with my brother.
 He came along with me. Suddenly, I heard someone calling my name. It 
was Alice.<br>She was slipping and slipping because of the ice. I didn't
 slip that much. Alice even tripped down! Well, she got up easily. She 
boasted to me about her new cell phone. She got the 어린 왕자 or Young 
Prince phone. I don't have a phone. My mom said if I get a phone, I will
 not really concentrate on my work and send messages to my friends and 
talk with them everyday. She said I can't keep getting all 100<ins>'</ins>s if I get
 a phone. So, I decided to not get a phone <ins>n</ins>or<ins> do I</ins> want a phone. Maybe I'll 
get a phone when I learn how to control myself<del> (lol) haha</del>. So, <ins>on </ins>one side I

 a snowman and hand in it for the vacation homework. I had read about 
the one part that said 'take a picture of your snowman, and write a 
report.' I told Alice and she agreed. Unfortunately, in the middle of 
our work, Alice's phone's battery got all used up<ins>,</ins> and she couldn't take 
anymore pictures! So, we just decided to play something else<mod target = . But>, but</mod> we

"812":::"[Nepal's living Goddess, 'Kumari']<br><br>Dear Little Fox readers,<br><br>Hey guys, it's Jinny again. A few days ago, I heard some unexpected news from my English academy. Do you believe in gods? Do you believe in Buddha or are you Hindu? Actually, I'm Christian<mod target = . But>, but</mod> that isn't <mod target = a>the</mod> point. In a few cities in Nepal, such as its capital city<del>,</del> Katmandu, they have a living goddess named Royal Kumari or Kumari Devi.<br>Oh, let me introduce myself first. My name is Jinny and I'm 14 years old in 2013. My elementary school is Seosan Elementary School<ins>,</ins> and my middle school will be Buchun Middle School<del>s</del>. I didn't graduate from my elementary school<ins>,</ins> yet. Next Wednesday is my graduation day. I think I might write about my graduation day next week. Let's talk about it later. I need to tell you lots of things about Kumari.<br>Kumari is a young girl. All Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal and India admire her. Kumari comes from an ancient story. An ancient goddess named Taleju came to the ground looking like a pretty young girl. One day, a Nepal<ins>ese</ins> king wanted to take her. Then, she was really angry so she went back to the sky. When the king regretted his mistake and begged for forgiveness, Taleju told to him to find a young pure girl to be her helper. She told him to admire her. This is the ancient story about Kumari<mod target = . Because> because</mod> Kumari is a living goddess, <ins>and </ins>she must have many qualifications. <br>Kumari must have 32 perfect qualities. Not all the qualities are made public, but I knew about a few of them. Kumari can only be selected from young girls who are aged <mod target = 2>two</mod> to <mod target = 4>four</mod>. She must have be from the family named Shaka (descendants of Sukgamony), and she can only live in Katmandu, which is Nepal's capital city. According to ancient text<ins>s</ins>, Kumari musn't have any scars or blood. If Kumari bleeds, she can't be Kumari anymore. Kumari must have cow-like eyes, <ins>a </ins>snail-like neck,<ins> and a</ins> tree-like body. Also, she must be calm and brave. Kumari should have 20 teeth. The final test is to have Kumari sleep in a place full of dead and bloody animals. When they finish all of the tests, there are no doub<del>s</del>t that she is a Kumari.<br>When the girls are living as Kumari, her rank is even higher than the rank of kings. I told you, dear readers, all of the Hindus and Buddhists admire her. Kumari lives in a palace. She lives in luxury while she is the Kumari. <br>Although Kumari are rich and do not do anything, some people point out <ins>that being </ins>Kumari could be like child-abuse, so they want to figure out the facts. <mod target = Because of>Due to</mod> this, Nepal<ins>'s</ins> court investigates <del>about </del>Kumari's abuse.<br>In fact, Kumari lives a very lonely life in her own palace. The government thinks that humans can't teach a goddess, so a few years ago, none of the people taught Kumari. And she couldn't go out by herself. Her mother and father would carry her during festivals. Outside, Kumari shouldn't stand by herself. Kumari has to sit down in a golden chair and watch people pray to her. They only look outside during the festival times. At this time, people think when they see her, it brings them good luck. <mod target = And the>The</mod> worst part is no one cares about the retired Kumari. When she retires, there are superstitions, which is when<ins> a</ins> Kumari comes back to her family's home, she brings bad luck to her family. Also, when a former Kumari gets married, it also bring<ins>s</ins> them bad luck. So<ins>,</ins> a few decades ago<del>,</del> Kumari often had to live in a slum for the rest of <mod target = her life>their lives</mod>. <mod target = But fortunately>Fortunately</mod>, now<del>,</del> people don't believe that anymore. <br>Now<ins>,</ins> I'm going to explain some traditions about the Kumari. When people kiss on her feet, she gives them a blessing. Blessing means a lot of gold for them. Also, they give her a payment, too.<br>Well, I need to do other homework. Have a nice New Years Day!<del>!</del><br><br>Thursday, February 7th, 2013, 9:11pm<br>From, Jinny":::
"814":::"Dear, Little Fox reader,<br>Hi, it's me again dear reader. I 
want to continue my story about the daily life at the chosen mentoring 
camp. Did I already talk to you about new years day? Well, let's start.<br>Before
 I tell you, let me introduce myself. I'm Jinny and in 2013, I am 14 
years old. Now, my school, Seosan elementary school had winter vacation.
 So now, I'm writing and working on a novel<mod target = . But>, but</mod> let's talk about my novel later.<br>At first, this story is about what happened on January 2nd. On that day, we went to Lotte World. <mod target = But before>Before</mod> we went there, we needed to <mod target = spent>spend</mod>
 time mentoring because the silly camp reserved the tickets for the 
afternoon. I wanted to get there as fast as I could, but my teacher told
 us that there wouldn't be a picnic anymore. So<ins>,</ins> we planned to eat many snacks. Like potato<ins>s</ins>,
 squid with butter, coke, and a few of other things. After mentoring, we
 went to eat lunch. We used forks at lunch. Well, never mind. Then, we 
started to go to Lotte World. One and a half hours later, we arrived. <br>At 3 o'clock, we walked through the entrance. Since the last time I visited Lotte World was when I was <mod target = 9>nine</mod>
 years old, I didn't remember many things about it from that day. 
However, my dear roommates were richer than I thought. They told me that
 they will go to Lotte World after the camp is finished<mod target = . And>, and</mod> they already knew about many of the rides at Lotte World. In my case, my family didn't go to amusement parks often.<br>When I went there<del>, first,</del> we drank coke at the Lotteria<ins> first</ins>.
 I really wanted to eat or drink something, so I liked that very much. 
Then, my mentoring teacher suggested to us that she wants to rest so 
that we could play by ourselves<mod target = . And>, and</mod> we said yes. We went 
to ride a bike and I teased my friend Yu-Mi-Hyang that I came to Lotte 
World. My roommates and I went bike riding. Although we went around the 
U-shape while biking, I sat <ins>on </ins>the end of the bike. It was scary, but also fun. After that, we were waiting for a <mod target = riding>ride</mod> named <ins>the </ins>French Revolution. They told me<ins> the</ins> French Revolution spins 360˚. <mod target = Because of>Due to</mod> that, we had to wait for <mod target = 2>two</mod>
 hours. While we were waiting, I ate a peanut butter squid. It was very 
delicious. I still want to eat it again. After I went on the ride, I ate
 a tornado potato<mod target = . But>, but</mod> I liked the squid better. I wanted to ride the Giant Hoop, but we needed to search for our teacher first. We rode <ins>the </ins>Turing Basket with my teacher. She was talking about the mentoring camp. It was very funny. Then we ate pork cutlet. <mod target = Because>Since</mod> I ate <mod target = lots>a lot</mod>
 of snacks, I didn't eat much. We still had a lot of time so we bought 
hairbands. I bought a small blue-spotted hairband. We ride more bikes 
than we came back to our lodging.<br>The next day, we had to have a mock
 assembly at the evening and night. I was chosen to represent the party.
 Our party's name was the Grape Party. We had so much fun with it. There
 were four topics including Korean folk tales (Shim Chung), talent's 
privacy, and <ins>an </ins>internet real-name financial transaction system. There was 
also one more subject<ins>,</ins> but I can't remember!<br>On Thursday, we cheered 
for each university: Korea University vs. Yonsei University. <mod target = Because>Since</mod> our
 mentoring teacher was a Korea University student, my roommates and I 
cheered for that university. Like Seoul University and Kaist, it is one 
of the best universities<mod target = . But,>, but</mod> I think winning and losing is not that 
important. All of the guys, even the teachers, were laughing and playing
 cheerfully.<br>On the last day, we had a good-bye party. Well, at the 
end when we were hugging our teacher, I cried softly. We all wrote 
letters to our teacher. When it was time to confess, we teased the camp 
because we all disliked it. When it was finished, we had a cake and all 
of my roommates and a few of the teachers played with each other. <br>The
 next day, I went back home. This is the end. I need to send<ins> a</ins> message to 
my teacher, so I need to say good-bye to you dear readers. Have fun!<br><br>Thursday, January 17th, 2013. 11:10pm.<br>From. Jinny":::
"816":::"Dear Little Fox Reader,<br><br>Nice winter, isn't it? Well, 
three days ago, it was Christmas! Today, I'll tell you about the origin 
of Christmas and why Christmas is sometimes called X-mas. Also, I'll 
tell you about some famous Christmas books<ins>,</ins> too.<br><del>Ummm... </del>Shall I introduce myself? I believe you already know <ins>things </ins>about me<del>,</del> like I'm 13 years and I live in Seosan, I'm in band class,<ins> and</ins> I'm in <mod target = 3rd>the third</mod> class<del> and etc..</del>.
 So, maybe I can skip this part today. I'm sorry if this is your first 
time meeting me, but we have still more things that I will introduce.<br>The first thing I would like to talk about is the origin of Christmas. It happened more than 2<ins>,</ins>000 years ago. A holy woman named Mary<del>,</del>
 saw an angel came down from sky. The angel's name was Gabriel. He said 
to Mary that she will give birth to a baby. The baby was the son of God<mod target = . And>, and</mod> he also told Mary that she should called the baby, <ins>""</ins>Jesus.<ins>""</ins>
 On the other hand, the king had a dream at the same time. God told him 
that a baby aged 1 to 3 will be a king. Then the king was angry. He 
commanded his soldiers to kill all boys between the ages of 1 to 3. So, 
Mary and her fiance, Joseph<ins>,</ins> had to run away<mod target = . And>, and</mod> 
Mary gave birth to Jesus in a little stable. At the same time, three 
wise men in the East saw a big star in the sky. They knew that their 
king was just born. So<ins>,</ins> they hurried to the stable with special presents,
 which were gold, myrrh, and frankincense. <mod target = And the>The</mod> year that Jesus born 
is<ins> called</ins> A.D<ins>.</ins> (Anno Domini). Also, Jesus <ins>was </ins>born on December 25. This is the 
origin of Christmas!<br>Well, now I will change our subject to talk 
about why Christmas is sometimes called X-mas. Read carefully, dear 
readers. Before I tell you about this, I suggest that you shouldn't use 
X-mas if you are not Christian. Keep this in mind. Now, <mod target = LET'S START>let's start</mod>!<br>So<ins>,</ins>
 how did Christmas change to X-mas? What does it mean? It is because of 
the Greek language. X means Christ<mod target = . And>, and</mod> mas <mod target = is>means</mod> mass. So, X-mas is<ins> the</ins> same 
meaning of Christmas. I told you that you should keep in a mind that 
non-Christian people should not use this word, right? It's because of 
the X's meaning. In fact, X means 10 <ins>as </ins>dollars, <ins>an </ins>unknown quantity, <ins>a </ins>sign 
that <del>the </del>people who don't know<ins> the</ins> word<del>,</del><ins> for</ins> a kiss sign in letter<ins>s</ins>.<br><mod target = Last>The last</mod> one is a book about Christmas. I think everyone knows the story<mod target = ,> called</mod> The Christmas Carol. <br>I'm sorry that today I have a very short letter<mod target = . But,>, but</mod> I need to sleep now.

 before I write my letter to you about part two, I need to give a 
summary of the last letter, right? In my last letter, I introduced you 
to my band members, didn't I? Today, is part<ins>-</ins>two of the letter. I will introduce you to the last members, including myself, and tell you about the Seo San Teuroteu contest. <mod target = Because,>Since</mod>
 there is a lot of information about my band, I might write a third part
 for this letter. In fact, I don't want to write you three letters about
 my band class<del>,</del> because still I have so many things to tell you about my story. We don't have enough time<mod target = , but> because</mod> we have so many things to do. Well, shall I start to tell you about my story?<br>So,
 let me introduce myself again. Whoever remembers me can skip this part.
 I'm Jinny. If someone is meeting me for the first<ins> time</ins>, I want to say, 
""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" <mod target = But let's>Let's</mod> hope everyone who is
 reading this letter already knows who I am. <br>Last time, did I introduce Kim-Mi-Jung? If I did not, I will introduce her first.<br>Her
 name is Kim-Mi-Jung. She plays the guitar. She started to learn how to 
play the guitar since last year. Well, Neko said that because Mi-Jung 
didn't practice as much as she did, she is in the same class with me. 
She is very small and very light. She plays the electric guitar. Last 
year, when Mi-Jung performed at an English festival, she sat down in a 
chair because she is very small.<br>The next people I want to talk about
 are the drummers. We have two drummers. At first, we had three 
drummers, two boys and one girl. <mod target = But>However,</mod> we practiced only two songs<mod target = , also>. Also</mod>, 
there were no empty seats where he could play. Never mind. Now, I will 
tell you guys about Na-ri.<br>Well... she has two nicknames. One is 
Forsythia. Forsythia's Korean name is Ge-Na-ri. She doesn't like this 
nickname. That is because her name is Na-ri. She doesn't like this 
nickname! However, her other name is farewell (작별). She made it herself.
 Never mind. Let's talk about her sound. Her drumming is brilliant. I 
really like the music she plays. Now, she likes to study bass. In fact, 
we help each other to make better sound and music. She is a pretty good 
teacher. Now, I can play the basic meter on the drums. I think she is 
almost ready to master one song already. <br>There is also a small boy 
who plays the drum<ins>s</ins>. He is small, a little fat<ins>,</ins> and has a lot of energy 
inside. His drum sound is energetic and powerful. I like his sound, too.
 I think his family has many relatives who play the drums. In fact, his 
brother played the drums last year, too. <br>Our band teacher always 
says that the boy needs to control his power. Never mind about that. His
 name is Jung-Gang. His nickname is Gang-Jung, of course. <br><mod target = Umm... 
umm... you>You</mod> are almost done. Now it is the basses' turn. First, I will 
introduce the other member named, Kim Hae Min. She is really good<mod target = . But>, but</mod> 
our teacher said she can't keep the beat<mod target = . And,>, and</mod> she says she can see a 
ghost.<br>The last member is me, Jinny. As you know, I'm play not only the bass guitar but also the keyboard.<br><mod target = But>However,</mod> you know me now, so I don't need to introduce myself once again. <br>Today's
 letter was so boring, right? Next week, I will write you a letter about
 my teuroteu contest. I promise. So, for today, I want<ins> </ins>to say bye! <br><br>Thursday, December 13th, 11:55 pm<br>From, Jinny":::

How do I feel about them? I don't like tests that much. Umm...<del> </del>let's talk about it later. It's not a good subject to talk about in the beginning of winter.<br>Back to the our first subject, okay? Three days ago, the weather forecast sent the news to us that it would snow. Like most ordinary children, my friends and I were very happy to see a lot of snow<mod target = . And>, and</mod> surprisingly, my class teacher allowed us to play in the playground.

Also, I threw snowballs at my friend. She didn't like it. However, she threw a snowball at me, so it was ok.<br>Maybe it was Wednesday, if my memory is working correctly.

Actually<ins>,</ins> our academy car must leave before 8:40<mod target = . But>, but</mod> that day<del>,</del> we started to leave at 8:50.

I wanted to get there before <mod target = 6>six</mod>. <mod target = But>However,</mod> my friend who goes to a math academy said they were going to their math academy first instead of going to our English academy first. So, I went to the math academy<ins>,</ins> too! That day, it was very boring.<br>When I got to the English academy, the decorations were great. On the ceiling, there were spiders on spider webs. On the front door there was a mummy shaking it's hand. On the wall, there was a big Jack-o-lantern, witch, <ins>and </ins>cat<del>, etc</del>. In the library, every desk was gone. The teacher wore a costume. Sandra was a cowgirl. Hera was a witch. Julie and Piggy didn't wear anything. I think Ethan was a ghost.<br>For Halloween, we collected special money called coupons. It was just paper<mod target = . But>, but</mod> on Halloween, the coupon was very valuable paper. We bought cookies, candies<ins>,</ins> and other products<ins>,</ins> too.

 letter might be very short. Unfortunately, my school has a test on 
October 23rd. It is a midterm exam. Actually, I'm very surprised because
 my school's test is very late. Well, Diana's school already finished 
their test <mod target = 2>two</mod> weeks ago. She said the test was easy. On the 
other hand, Bill, who goes to the same school as Diana, said the test 
was hard. As for me, I'm not at the same school as Diana, so I will take
 the test later. Two weeks before taking the test, my friend, Jin-Sook, 
and I went to the library to study. I think that I studied very hard, 
but that doesn't really matter. People will judge another person by his 
or her results.<br>During the fi<ins>r</ins>st week, I went to the library at 10:00 a<ins>.</ins>m<ins>.</ins> exactly<mod target = . Because> because</mod> on Friday afternoon, my friend told me, ""Jinny, we are going to meet at the library by 10. Do you understand?"" <mod target = And of course>Of course</mod> I did! So<ins>,</ins> I got there at 10<mod target = . But>, but</mod> now I know better<del>,</del> because she would actually come to the library around noon. I did my homework, <ins>and I </ins>read some books<ins>,</ins> actually. Also, I studied for the test<ins>,</ins> too.<br>When
 she came, we studied at the children's library. In fact, we didn't 
study at first. We read a book called ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians.""
 30 minutes later, we started to study. Jin-sook and I <mod target = solves>solved</mod> the 
questions in the workbook.<br><del>(* An explanation about the library: </del>The 
Seo-San library is separated by many smaller libraries<del>,</del> for children, 
adults, teenagers, etc. On the second floor, there is a quiet place, and
 a laboratory. On the first floor, there was are all sorts of libraries 
as I explained, and there is also a movie theater.<del>)</del> We wanted to study 
on <mod target = 2nd>the second</mod> floor<ins>,</ins> but the middle school students didn't have their exams yet 
so we couldn't go there and study.<br>The next Saturday, I went to the 
library at 10:32 a<ins>.</ins>m<ins>.,</ins> and Jin-Sook said she would come there at 10. Our 
schedule to practice was the same. We often go to the back and study 
there. We studied there until 3<ins> p.m</ins>. This time, the older people finished 
their midterm test. So, I went upstairs. I couldn't believe myself 
because I met Joo-Yeon in the library. She is a friend of mine<ins>,</ins> but she 
doesn't want to practice her exam, especially at the library.<br>The day after Saturday, Sunday, was also the same. So, I don't have to tell you about that.

"822":::"Dear Little Fox Reader,<br><br>When was your field trip<mod target = ? And,>, and</mod>
 where did you go? Last Friday, I went to Everland on a field trip. Do 
you already know, ""To Everland, fantasy world""? Well, I had a few 
arguments with my dear friend, but I'll tell you about that later. It's 
not a good subject to talk about with you. Oh, I forget to introduce 
myself. It's a pleasure to meet you again. I'm Jinny. If someone is 
meeting me for the first time, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. 
I'm Jinny Lee."" <mod target = But let's>Let's</mod> hope everyone who read this letter already knows who I am. <br>Well,
 today, I will tell you about my field trip. Last Friday, on October 
12th, our school went to Everland on a field trip. At first, my team and
 I rode on the first bus.<br>For young readers, I'll explain what 
Everland is. Everland is located in Young-in. It was made in 1976. It is
 very large. I even got lost in Everland! <br>Our teacher said that the 
bus cost was much higher to get to Everland. So, our class was separated
 into three groups. There are four classes for the sixth grade. Someone 
said that it's because the school wanted to have fewer classes<mod target = . But,>, but</mod>
 it's actually because another school was built a few years ago. Also, 
Seosan primary school is in the middle of street. As a result,there is 
only a small number of students who go to our school. It's not my fault.<br>Anyway,
 I'm a member of the third class. My team and the boys team were riding 
on the first bus. One group of boys and one group of noisy girls were on
 the second bus. My dear friend, Joo-Yoen complained to me about this. 
She wanted me to go on her bus. In fact, I hoped that I would be able to
 go with her<mod target = . But>, but</mod> our team lost at the rock- scissors- 
paper game. Also, I wouldn't like to ride on that bus either. On that 
bus, there were some unfriendly faces. I wouldn't like to be face to 
face with any of the naughty girls.<br>I will get back to my original story now. We left to go to Everland at 7 o'clock in the morning. Since we were leaving so early,<ins> </ins>I had to wake up at 6. Then, I ate kimbob. Next, I went to school.<del> Blah, blah, blah.</del> The teacher talked to us about something<mod target = . But>, but</mod> I can't remember<ins> what it was</ins>.
 She might have said that we must be careful in Everland. But that 
wasn't that important. The most important thing was, we were riding a 
bus, right?<br>After we arrived at the front gate, I was very surprised. At that time, there were many people<ins>,</ins> and it was very crowded. Well, we waited an <mod target = 1>one</mod> hour before we could get in! <del>Th </del>My friend murmured to me that people should want to rest on the weekends. I agree<ins>d</ins>
 with her opinion. However, we were finally able to go inside. Our team 
is made up of both boys and girls. There were four boys and two girls. <br>In
 fact, my own plan was to visit the Horror Maze, which is only held in 
September and October. <mod target = But unfortunately>Unfortunately</mod>, I am only thirteen years old. 
That ghost house only allows people who are at least fifteen years old. 
When I searched the internet, everyone who experienced the ghost house 
said that it was really scary. I might go there a few years later.<br>At
 first, we were waiting to go on a ride called <ins>the </ins>Hurricane. It swings 
around like going down a big slide<mod target = . But>, but</mod> the difference is that it also 
spins around. My teammate said it looked very scary, but I told them 
that it wasn't very scary. One of my friends, Mi Jung, said it was very 
fun after we went on the ride. <mod target = But> On</mod> the other hand, I don't think the 
boys enjoyed it as much as we did. Then, it was 11 a<ins>.</ins>m. One boy, named 
An-Dae Hyun<ins>,</ins> said to me he wanted to get a Q-PAss for the T-Express<mod target = . But>, but</mod> 
when we reached for it, the Q-pass was done. <mod target = Because of>Due to</mod> this, we ate 
something instead. It was noon.<br>After we finished eating our lunch, 
we walked and walked. I thought that we were very unlucky. The parade 
was about to start. We couldn't get through. So An-Dae-Hyun suggested 
that we ride the lift. The park was very crowded because as I had 
mentioned before there were many people. So<ins>,</ins> we had to go in two separate
 lifts.<br>When we arrived at the other ride called the Rolling X Train,
 we couldn't find <mod target = out>our</mod> other teammates. So<ins>,</ins> we just went on the ride. <br>Well,
 I actually thought it wasn't that great. Maybe you want to tell me to 
s<ins>t</ins>op complaining, but I hope that you loved reading this letter. Bye.<br><br><br>Thursday, October 18th. 11:01pm<br>From, Jinny":::

Well, Bella doesn't wear eyeglasses. She is best friends with <br>Diana. Her school is Seo Rim Primary School<del>l</del>. I can't say much about <br>Bella.<br>Judy is the shortest person in our academy. She is the <br>smartest friend I have ever met. Judy is always in first place.

 weekend, I went to my grandmother's house. Before I tell my story, 
should I ask you about something? Do you know when it was Thanksgiving 
in the United States? I'm sure you already know because you are smart. 
That's right. I knew you would know it. Thanksgiving is every 4th 
Thursday in November. They eat turkey for dinner. Well, in my case, I 
haven't had turkey before, so I can't tell you what it tastes like<mod target = . But>, but</mod> I'm sure it is delicious, isn't it?<br>Well,
 if you know about Thanksgiving is in the United States, it is very 
similar to Thanksgiving in Korea. It's called Chuseok! Chuseok is the 
one of the most well-known<del>(famous) </del>holidays in Korea. Therefore, the government designated the Chuseok holiday for <mod target = 3>three</mod>
 days. During this time, usually almost all Koreans go to visit their 
parents. In my case, I visited my grandmother who lives in the country. <br>On the 29th of September<del>,</del>
 in the morning, my father and my brother, Evan, went to my grandma's 
house first. My mom and I left later because my mom had to work that 
day. If I went first, she would have had to ride the bus by herself. So,
 even though I couldn't make songpyeon, I went to my grandmother's house
 with my mom. On the other hand, I wanted to search the internet 
secretly. <br>I could do whatever I wanted to before leaving, and my mom
 and I got to my grandma's house around 8 o'clock. At the bus stop, I 
wanted to eat Pringles but the the worker at the store said<del>,</del> there were none. In fact, the stores did have it<mod target = . But>, but</mod>
 I want to buy a little one. Luckily, at the other station, mom bought 
me some triangle-Kimbob and snacks. Also, I was sending text messages 
with my phone. I was texting with my friend. She is a very cheerful 
girl. She and I have the same sense of humor. For example, I send her a 
photo of the moon. Can you guess what she said? She texted me back 
saying, ""Jinny, the moon is so pretty<mod target = . But>, but</mod> I think a huge rabbit in the moon has visited the <mod target = earth>Earth</mod>."" She is so funny!<br>However,
 when my mom and I arrived at my aunt's house, it was almost ten o'clock
 at night. Actually<ins>,</ins> my father said to me that he would take us to my 
grandma's house<mod target = . But>, but</mod> he was already out because he had take one of my 
aunts to her house. <del>(</del>I have three aunts and one uncle.<del>)</del> So, my aunt, the
 wife of my father's older brother, came to take us to the house<mod target = . And>, and</mod> 
she told us about what my grandmother said to her. Well,  it was just 
for my imagination because my mom didn't like what my aunt was saying. <br>We went to the house. I said hello to grandmother. After watching a short TV show, I slept. The first day was over.<br>The
 next day, I woke up at half past six<del>,</del> because I needed to pray to my 
grandfather. It was boring<ins>,</ins> and I wanted to sleep. Therefore, Evan and I 
were fighting. Well, we didn't hit each other. We just made a little 
noise. <br>I visited my family's graveyard. I also helped my mom <del>to </del>make
 food. I helped to pick up the sesame leaves<ins>,</ins> too. One of my cousins and I
 saw the rabbits <ins>and </ins>gave them some food. After that, my family went back 
home again.<br>I like Chuseok, but I don't like all of the noise during 
Chuseok. It drove me crazy. Well, did you enjoy my letter this time? I 
hope you did. Well, see you later in my diary! Bye!<br><br>Tuesday, October 9th. 2012. 10:47 pm.<br>From. Jinny":::

"827":::"Dear Little Fox reader, <br><br>Hi, I'm Jinny. It's nice to 
meet you again in my English diary. Every week, I'll write a letter to 
you about one of my fun stories. Before I tell you, I have a question 
for you. How much do you know about Greek mythology? In ancient Greece, 
people made these myths. People made gods and goddesses like Jupiter, 
Pluto, Diana and Athena. Also, the gods and goddesses had many stories 
that gave inspiration to artists to make works about Greek myths. Much 
of the art or sculpture<del>s</del> can be found at the Louvre in 
Paris. You may wonder why I'm talking about Greek myths and the Louvre. 
It's because I want to tell you about my trip <del>from </del>last Sunday. <del>- Sunday 3rd, September, 2012.- </del><br>From
 June 5th to September 30th, I have some interesting thoughts about this
 trip. One day, I watched the Our World Landmarks series on Little Fox. 
At the time, my parents were sitting beside me. I thought my mom was 
very interested in learning more about the Musée du Louvre (The Louvre).
 She asked me to translate the story of<ins> the</ins> Louvre. After my 
family heard the story, my mother wanted to do more research about the 
Musée du Louvre. In fact, I'm very interested in art. So<ins>,</ins> I also searched everything<mod target = . And>, and</mod> I learned that this year, <ins>the </ins>Louvre's art and statues of Greek mythology would be in Seoul. Well, it would be at the Seoul Art Center-Hangaram art museum<mod target = . Actually, not just the Louvre exhibition but also> with</mod> other exhibitions such as university opera concerts and piano concerts. <del>And </del>I think I am very thankful to Little Fox to help me make one of my greatest memories with my family.<br>Now,
 I'll tell you about my trip. On the 3rd day of September, I woke up 
early. Well, not that early<ins>,</ins> actually. Maybe around 7:30? However, my 
family and I, except my brother, ate breakfast and rode in my mom's car.
 Two hours later, we got there. <br>I have personally never been to an 
art museum in Seoul. So<ins>,</ins> this was the first time that I visited Seoul for
 looking at art. As you know, Seosan is not the as same as Seoul. The 
buildings are high, and the people are crowded everywhere on the 
streets. Even inside of a building, it's hard to find the exit. <br>On the other hand, when we went up, I still liked that place because of its huge size. <br>First,
 I visited a gift shop. There were many things that were related to 
Greek mythology like a picture of Zeus or Mercury. I bought small cards 
of pictures. The name<ins>s</ins> are: ""The Fall of Phaeton,"" ""Pygmalion and 
Galateia,"" and ""Daphnis et Chloé."" I wanted to buy the notebook too, but
 it cost so much money! <mod target = But fortunately>Fortunately</mod>, mom gave me the guide book that
 described the artwork in the museum. Inside of the museum, I was sad 
because I couldn't take any photos inside. <mod target = And did>Did</mod> you know this? I 
swear that one person took a photo of the artwork. It's against the 
rules in the museum. I don't like those kinds of people.<br>Inside of 
the museum, I saw a statue of Mercury. Also<ins>,</ins> I saw amphora, an ancient 
Greek jar, and dishes that were really used a long time ago. I saw a 
tapestry that was also really used. I wanted to touch it but I couldn't.
 Touching it is the main reason that will cause <mod target = a>the</mod> tapestry to crack. I 
admired the artwork and saw the little guidebook and told my parents 
about other Little Fox episodes I remembered such as Eros and Psyche or 
Zeus and Io. I had lots of fun <mod target = that>when</mod> I went there. If I have another 
chance like this, I'll go again! <br>See you next week, Little Fox reader!<br><br>Friday, September 7th, 10:35pm.<br>From. Jinny.":::
"829":::"I had two pet hamsters. They were given to me by my uncle on my 13th birthday. I called them Pearl and Ruby. Pearl was rather lazy and would curl up in a corner of her cage and sleep all day, only getting up to eat.

When I returned with the bowls, I found the door ajar and Ruby was missing!<br>I panicked and ran around the house looking frantically for the missing Ruby. However, Ruby was nowhere to bee seen. Suddenly, I heard a high-pitched squeak from the bathroom. I ran toward the bathroom to hear another squeak, this time it came from the small drain in the bathroom. I stared in horror as I looked down the drain, thinking that I would never see Ruby again. I was very sad and vowed to take better care of Pearl after the loss of Ruby.<br>The following day in the afternoon, however, the doorbell rang. A neighbor who lived downstairs from my apartment held out his hand to reveal a very disgruntled and smelly Ruby.The neighbor explained that Ruby had emerged from his rubbish chute and had given him quite a shock.

"830":::"I do not see many people who fly kites in China<del>,</del> even though it happens a lot in books. Despite this, I have always wanted to fly a kite.<br>After asking for one, my parents brought home a large kite in the shape of an eagle. They said that it was for me<ins>,</ins> and I could have a go at flying it during the weekend when they were free to take me to West Coast Park. I waited anxiously for the weekend and was ready to go by the time it was Saturday.<br>We carefully set the kite up, laying the pieces on the grass and putting them together. The kite was made from thin but sturdy pieces of wood and slightly stretchable cloth. While I was holding the ball of string, my father picked the kite up and began running in the direction of the wind. When the breeze grew strong enough, he let go of the kite and it soared up into the sky.<br>I watched as the kite flew higher and higher as my father twirled the ball of string.

The baby was sent to a workhouse, and <ins>was </ins>named Oliver Twist. The boys there wanted more food, and they chose Oliver to ask for more. Oliver carried out the task, and he was treated cruelly as a result. The workhouse didn't want him anymore, and gave him to an undertaker. The undertaker was kind to Oliver, but the undertaker's family was unjust and bad to Oliver. Oliver escaped after being beaten by the family. He was wandering the street when he met a boy from a group of boy beggars. He joined the group, but he was greeted with a huge incident. The boys were pickpockets on the busy London streets, and that day, Oliver left with two boys. The two boys stole a gentleman's handkerchief, and the gentleman realized his handkerchief was gone. Oliver did not steal the handkerchief, but he was accused of stealing it because he was standing right behind the gentleman. <mod target = But>However,</mod> the truth was discovered a few hours later, by a bookstore owner.

I think I will feel great after studying hard at CEEGY and returning home, rather than just playing. Our lessons were close to playing and talking, but it will be different now.<br>From the CEEGY books, I read ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time"" and ""The Giver"".

Many South Korean soldiers and North Korean soldiers were killed there. There is a story that the soldiers' blood mixed together in the Nakdong River, which made the place even more frightening.

"904":::"There is a poem titled ""Alchemy"", written by Sara Teasdale. The poem is the following:<br><br>I lift my heart as spring lifts up<br>A yellow daisy to the rain;<br>My heart will be a lovely cup<br>Altho' it holds but pain.<br><br>For I shall learn from flower and leaf<br>That color every drop they hold,<br>To change the lifeless wine of grief<br>To living gold.<br><br>""Change the lifeless wine of grief to living gold."" That's my favorite expression in this poem. This expression shows why the title is ""Alchemy"". Alchemy is all about changing a base metal to gold, and this poem is actually about turning something into another thing-something bad into a glorious,valuable thing. If scientific alchemy is about base metals and gold and silver, I believe the poem says that the alchemy of life is about changing grief to happiness and joy. As I mulled over this poem, I was thankful that humans have the ability to change emotions<mod target = . Because> because</mod> without this ability, we would live like reeds, our lives corrupted by bad, rough emotions. Alchemy is also all about choice. If we choose to stay happy, we would use the potions of smile<ins>s</ins>, positive attitude<ins>s</ins>, and brightness to make glittering happiness. If we choose to be unhappy, we would do nothing for our lifeless wine of grief to change to living gold-it would just stay as a lifeless wine, and we would have to drink it. We should use the magic of alchemy well in our lives<del>,</del> to live a happy life <mod target = enjoying>to enjoy</mod> living gold instead of a dull life drinking <ins>the </ins>wine<del>s</del> of grief.":::

"909":::"I have started to read Animal Farm with interest, not only because I have to read it for my English Gifted Education Center, but also because it is very fun. In the book, there are commandments called ""The Seven Commandments"". I have begun to focus on these commandments. Here <mod target = it is>they are</mod>:<br><br>""THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS. 1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 3. No animal shall wear clothes. 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 5. No animal shall drink alcohol. 6. No animal shall kill any other animal. 7. All animals are equal."" (24-25)<br><br><mod target = And>So,</mod> I have written a letter to Snowball, a smart pig who runs Manor Farm now that Jones is gone.<br><br>To: Snowball<br>Snowball, these commandments may seem fair to you and your comrades, but from the way I see it, they are not reasonable commandments. Rule seven and rule five seem good, but the rest of the commandments are very unreasonable. <br>Let's look at rule one. You said that birds' wings are legs, but they aren't. Legs support our body and help us to walk, and wings don't help the birds walk, and they don't support the birds' bodies. Birds have two legs, too. So you should say, ""except for birds"" at the end of the rule. Got it? Then change it.<br>Rule two is unreasonable also. Say that Mollie betrays you and goes off wandering back to Jones. Mollie still has four legs. Can you still say that Mollie is your friend? No, she is not<mod target = -> because </mod>she's your enemy. If anybody in the farm betrays you, or if any animal attacks you, they are your <mod target = enemies>enemy</mod>, not your friend<del>s</del>. <br>Rule three and four. Snowball, you like doing scientific experiments, don't you? Instead of avoiding the humans' possessions<del>,</del> you can take them into your laboratory and use them to make life for the animals more comfortable. Don't just avoid them-make them your own. You avoid everything related to humans. That's stupid. Change and develop the human possessions into your possessions so that your life and your comrades will have a better life. <br>Rule six seems fair, but for especially good reasons<mod target = ,> because</mod> you can kill another animal. For example, if a comrade betrays you and brings grave danger, you are free to kill that comrade. It is evil, but that is the only way. However, the bad thing is that it brings feuds<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>wars<ins>,</ins> and quarrels. So<ins>,</ins> I advise that you keep that rule.<br>So<mod target = .......>,</mod> I have said all I want to say. If you don't want to change your commandments, then don't. <mod target = But>However,</mod> I'm just asking you to consider my advice and review your commandments. Also, I ask you to reconsider your new maxim: ""Four legs good, two legs bad"". It isn't specific enough, so it would be nice if you could change it.<br>I hope your life goes well, and I sincerely hope Jones will not return to your farm. <mod target = But>However,</mod> he may return<del>,</del> if you don't get your animals in focus.

"910":::"I'm reading a book titled Animal Farm, written by George Orwell. At the beginning of the story, an old male pig named Old Major gathers all the farm animals and tells them his view about humans. He says that humans are all wicked, and humans are the only egotistic<ins>al</ins> animals on Earth. The animals give birth to baby animals and produce milk. Who are the ones who take those things? Humans! Old Major says that humans rob the animals' fruits of hard labor, and they never reward the animals with comfort<mod target = -they,>. </mod> <mod target = instead>Instead</mod>, <ins>they </ins>kill the animals when their death is drawing near. Old Major also says that all animals with four legs or wings are friends, and all animals with two legs (by this, he means only humans) are enemies. He tells the animals never to trust humans, and he hopes that someday, there will be a sort of rebellion or protest that will make the humans stop dominating the animals. There is even a lullaby between the animals that sings of a bright future<mod target = . And>, and</mod> this bright future means a future that is human-free.<br>Old Major was right.

"968":::"Today, I went to the museum that showed van Gogh's pictures to us. I had to travel there by subway for almost one hour standing, which made my mother and <mod target = me>I</mod> very tired<mod target = . But>, but</mod> it was worth it.<br>When we first entered the museum, there were pictures of van Gogh's brother, his sister, his mother, his father and many others. <mod target = And in>In</mod> the last picture, there was a picture of van Gogh<ins>'s</ins> and his brother's graves.

Yes. My guess was right.<br>We viewed picture after picture and listened to the museum guide. There is one interesting story that I remember. Van Gogh liked to use his name ""Vincent"" more than his last name. Also, he only wrote his signature on pictures that he personally liked. There are some other facts that showed van Gogh's mind about art. Even though he became so poor<del>, so poor</del> that he had to use old canvas and draw something else on the back of it<mod target = , and so poor>or</mod> that he had to cover the old painting that was first drawn on the canvas with new paints, he never gave up his love for art. I was really impressed by how a man could love something so much that he gave up his own life to draw pictures. <mod target = Because >Since </mod>he used cheap paints, there are many pictures that are not as brightly colored as <mod target = it>they</mod> used to be when he had first painted them <mod target = some>almost one</mod> hundred years ago. Some of them have already become much darker. Some of the pictures have had <mod target = its>their</mod> paint already peel off. <mod target = But>However,</mod> it was just beautiful by itself existing in this world that we live in. If you know even a tiny bit about van Gogh, you will easily find out that his paintings during one point in his life were very dark and creepy. He used dark colors such as black, purple and dark blue. This made his pictures look very scary. However, after he went to Paris, his paintings changed into brighter colors. Maybe he was quite desperate to earn money. He painted brighter and brighter picture<ins>s</ins> until <mod target = some>the</mod> months before his death. Right before his death, he was mentally ill. When he was ill and stayed in the hospital, he painted the picture ""Starry Night."" I think this is the most beautiful pictures that I ever saw in my life. Sadly, this picture was not in the museum. <mod target = But>However,</mod> every time I see this picture, I feel as if I am seeing the night sky from a hill top. So many stars are gleaming towards me. It is so dreamy. It seems as if I am apart from this world where people worry so much and talk back about each other. It just seems that life and death is nothing more then a dream. It is so so beautiful that it just seems as if the bright stars are gleaming in front of my very eyes.<br>If you have the time I really hope that you can go to the museum or read a book about van Gogh and know how much he loved art.":::

It just took about 20 minutes to arrive there. It is good to live near the airport because whenever I have time, I can go shopping at the malls near the airport with my friends. Anyway, our family sat in the airplane seats for 45 minutes. All of us slept until we arrived to Kimhye (it is near Busan) airport. When we arrived, my grandfather and grandmother on my father's side were waiting for us inside their car. After saying our hellos and some shaking of hands, we finally settled in and rode in the car for about one hour. We were not heading for their house but were heading for my grandparent's house on my mother's side. We were planning to stay there for one night. As soon as we arrived, we ate breakfast. My grandmother's food is always very delicious. I think it is because she only uses good ingredients to make food and also because of her secret recipe. My grandfather is a rock collector. Even though he lives in an apartment, there are hundreds of rocks placed neatly inside the glass. He likes to water his plants and take care of his garden<ins>,</ins> too.

 you read a book about ghosts, you will find that there are many types

First, there are ghosts which are in a particular place and do not have 
any resentment towards something. These ghosts may be seen by the people
 who come<del>s</del> to that place, whether for shelter or to live. <mod target = But>However,</mod>
 these types of ghosts cannot go to other places because they <del>are </del>just <del>
born (I don't know whether ghosts are born but whatever) to </del>live <del>only </del>in
 that place<ins> only</ins>. Second, there are ghosts who have resentment towards people
 because they were killed by somebody or for some other reason. People 
who come to the place where they are living become the target. Even if 
the target moves to another place, the ghosts can keep following them in
 some way such as going inside their dolls, stick<ins>s</ins>, notebook<ins>s,</ins> or some 
other object. Third, there are ghosts that came to this world because of
 some people who want to use them. They are just souls that are 
controlled by the people who called them. Fourth, there are fairies who 
are the guardians of a particular land or plants. There are some other 
types of ghosts, but these are the ghosts that are most commonly seen or
 felt.<br>Now, I will tell you my idea about ghosts. By searching about 
ghosts, I found the answer that I really wanted. It was written in the 
book called ""Ghost Dictionary."" Ghosts are minds. Everything in the 
world has a mind<ins>,</ins> and the minds that are visible are ghosts. There are 
many different minds. There are minds that contain resentment towards 
something. There are minds that love their country. There are minds that
 think of their family members. There are minds of animals that cannot 
speak. The mind has the biggest power in the world. It is our minds that
 occur in our world and the world <ins>to </ins>which dead people go. It is in our

It was so hard that I just wanted to sleep after finishing the first page. When the test was over, my best friend and I went shopping <mod target = at>in</mod> Insadong. We first ate our lunch and then met at the subway station. Insadong is one of the best places in Seoul. There are a lot of buildings around<ins>,</ins> but when you go onto this one street<del>,</del> you will feel like you are in 1980's. The things, such as the buildings there are very traditional and very old. There are a lot of galleries. There is even a gallery that shows traditional <mod target = knifes>knives</mod>. We went into one of the clock shops. However, the owner of the clock shop was on the phone and looked very, very angry. When I tried to see the big clock on display, she said, ""Do not go there,"" in a very, very impolite way. I wanted to buy a little clock, but her impolite behavior towards the customers made me so angry that I just went out to the street. I do not want to go to that store again.<br>We visited a few more galleries and went to the coffee shop. I bought coffee and some snacks and shared <ins>them </ins>with her.

"979":::"Yesterday, my grandmother sent me some boxes of kimchi<ins>,</ins> and I got <mod target = it>them</mod> today. It was in front of my house door. When my mother was back from work, we opened the box and tried some kimchi. It was<del> so, so, so,</del> so delicious! I was really thankful to my grandmother.<br>Have you ever eaten fresh kimchi with rice or some meat? It is so delicious that it will make you eat until your mouth is burning.<br>There are many kinds of kimchi. For example there is white kimchi, or dongchimi. Some of them are made in spring. Some of them are made in the summer, or fall. We make kimchi in ever<ins>y</ins> season.<br>However, the red kimchi <ins>is </ins>made from <del>of </del>cabbage<del>, which is made</del> in winter, is my favorite. The region it was made in makes the taste of the kimchi different. For example, my grandmother lives near Busan. Unlike many of those who buy jeotgal in markets, she makes it by herself. She uses anchovy jeotgal, pepper, salt, cabbage and many other vegetables when she makes kimchi. She puts it in a jar after it is finished. In other regions, they make it differently<mod target = . But>, but</mod> you can find out whether it was made in the upper or lower regions just by trying it. When you eat kimchi from the upper regions, it is usually not very salty and light. It is because the upper regions are colder than the other parts. When it is cold, the food does not really decompose. Think of it this way. When you put the food in the refrigerator, it does not really decompose.<br>In the lower regions, the weather is warmer than the upper regions. They put a lot of salty things, like salt, jeotgal and many other things that taste salty. This is because food goes bad more easily in the lower regions.<br>There are some particular regions near the sea that make kimchi with cabbage and sliced fish, or clams.<br>But, I want to say that kimchi is delicious. Some of your grandparents might send kimchi to you or maybe your mother makes it. Be thankful to them. Kimchi is one of the most delicious foods ever in history.":::
"980":::"I have never thought about how much a mother can do for her own child.<br>For example, ever since last week, my mother and I have both been very tired.

I am so thankful.<br>Today, I want to share with you some stories <mod target = that>about</mod> how strong a mother's love towards her children can be.<br>I saw in the news that a mother called Kera Cobella had given up her life to save her child. She could not give birth to two of her babies because they died in her womb. Then she became pregnant with her third baby and was so happy about it<mod target = .

By then she had cancer all over her body, and lost sigh<ins>t</ins> in one of her eyes<del>t</del>. She died this summer. Her husband said that when the baby grows up, he will tell him about his mother's brave choice.

I think if I was in a situation like that, I would not give birth to my baby and worry about myself. Of course<ins>,</ins> I will be sorry for my baby<ins>,</ins> but I think I will live more eagerly for my baby who saved my life.<br>Second, there is also your own mother who is sitting beside you or maybe working hard at her workplace. Sometimes, when you are angry at your mother, try to understand her. Mothers are the ones who love you best in this whole world. Of course<ins>,</ins> I am not a very good daughter<ins>,</ins> too.

I liked the part where she said, ""As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands; one for helping yourself, and the other for helping others."" The reason I wrote Audrey Hepburn's poem is because I want to talk about doing something for others.<br><br>Today, when I attended my academy class after school, my teacher told me the story about Mother Teresa's house for the dying.

She said she went out immediately<del>,</del> because she could not cope with it. There were mountains of cloth<ins>e</ins>s for her to wash<ins>,</ins> and she said she could not handle it. She described the people inside the house, the blood, and the smell. I<ins> </ins>was shocked. I sat at my seat, imagining all the things that she described. She described dirty people, blood dripping out from their <mod target = body>bodies</mod>, the smell, and all the other things. Then suddenly, I felt a strong emotion. I wanted to go there right away and help those who were lying weakly in their beds. I wanted to help them in any way I could<mod target = .

Many of my friends who are in America are from India. Also, I enjoy yoga and like to<ins> do</ins> research about India. It is such an interesting country.<br>Anyway, I read some words from the volunteers who worked at Mother Teresa's house for the dying. All of them said that it was really dirty. However all of them said it was one of the most beautiful times they ever had. By washing <mod target = these patients and feeding them>and feeding these patients</mod>, they said that they felt no worries but only happiness that they could help these people.<br>As I researched, I thought about the things I can do to help these people. First, since I cannot go there right now, I will donate my pocket money to the children in Africa and help them go to school. Also, I plan to go there when I become an adult. Then, I read the sentence that said, ""People liked my massage."" YES!!! I have a very strong finger and when I massage my grandmother or my mother, they always say that they feel really good when I massage them. I think I will be able to massage the patient<ins>s</ins> in the house. I really want to go there. As Mother Teresa did, I will feed those people and love them as if they are my family. I will go there as soon as I go to the university. Until that time comes, I will still think of another way to help others.<br>Good-bye everybody.":::

"984":::"Yesterday was my friend's birthday. It was so, so much fun. The day before yesterday, I went to the beauty shop with my mother to buy a present for my friend. It was a cleansing oil, which makes the pores of your nose large so the blackheads can go out. It is made with ashes <mod target = of>from a</mod> volcano.<br>Yesterday when I woke up, I finished my math homework, and dressed up to meet my friends. My best friend and I celebrated her birthday. She got two presents, one from me and another one from my best friend. My friend gave her a leather diary. It was pink and even though I do not like pink, I still thought it looked beautiful. We went to a fast food restaurant, and ate some hamburgers after my friend saw our presents. Then, we went to see a short 4D video. There is a small 4D shop in our town called ""Max Rider."" It is almost like an amusement park squished into one room. We selected 'Space Adventure."" It was very exciting. The door closed, and we wore special glasses to see the 4D screen. There is a big car in the middle of the room that looks like a bumper car that shakes, rattles, and even makes water vapor come out. It was as if we rode a real bumper car and it was running<del>..</del>.There was a front seat and back seat, and my friends and I sat in the back seat, which shakes more than the front seat. When the video started, snakes came out and hissed in front of my eyes, at least that was what I saw, and there were all kinds of space monsters coming out. It was really thrilling<del>,</del> and scary. We watched ""Goblin World<ins>,</ins>"" too. It was not as scary as ""Space Adventure"" but very speedy and fun.<br>After that, we went to the singing room, and sang for an hour. My neck felt as if it was going to break. Anyway, I sang so many songs. As I sang loudly, it was as if all my stress just disappeared into the air. You, who is reading my diary, might know that feeling of your stress disappearing as you sing. After an hour of singing, we went to the beauty shop to buy some makeup, such as pretty tint, lip balm, mascara, and eye shadow. Later<ins>,</ins> when I came back home and told my mother that my friends<ins> and</ins> I bought some makeup tools, my mother was surprised. She said when she was a student, she and her friends did not buy or put on makeup. They thought it was for adults, not for students. However, if you are a girl, and you are going to go to middle school, you will definitely learn how to put on makeup by <ins>watching </ins>the older students <del>at school, </del>or <del>by </del>your friends<ins> at school</ins>. Oh<ins>,</ins> don't say<ins>,</ins> ""I won't!"" because I thought that I wouldn't when I was in elementary school too<del> ^ ^</del>.<br>Anyway, after we bought some makeup, we went straight to the trampoline shop, where we paid money, went in, and bounced until our muscles were burning. It was really fun. When I jumped up high and touched the ceiling, it felt as if I was flying high into the sky. I went straight home after thirty minutes, because I felt so tired. We all said our good-byes and headed straight home. It was really a fun day after all. Now that my birthday is in May, I have to wait until next year to have my birthday party.

"985":::"Have you ever heard about little mom<del>,</del> or an unmarried mother?<br>I think if you, whoever is reading my diary, passed your twelfth birthday, you might have heard about it from your mother or from your health teacher at school. Today, my best friend and I discussed this topic in school. My best friend and I went to the library this very morning, and found a book called ""Kissing My Life"". It was about a young girl, who is seventeen, having a baby and being an unmarried mother. She became an unmarried mother by her boyfriend, and had to choose between just having surgery to kill the baby inside her womb, or giving birth to the baby. <mod target = And in>In</mod> the end, she gave birth to the baby and became an unmarried mother.<br><br>This is a very important issue. I also researched this problem, and it turns out that in many schools, teachers just pressure the unmarried mothers to get out of their school. I really disagree. Even if it is wrong to have a baby at that age, the school should lead them <mod target = to>in</mod> the right <mod target = way>direction</mod>, and should not pressure them to give up their studies. Even though they became a young mother and gave birth to a baby, it does not mean they should give up their studies.<br>Also, there is another very serious problem<mod target = ;>:</mod> many people see them as if they are like a prisoner or an animal inside the cage of a zoo. In the newspapers that I researched, people looked at them in a very <mod target = wrong>improper</mod> way<del>,</del> and treated them with a very <mod target = wrong>bad</mod> attitude. At least, they should treat the unmarried mothers as humans. Staring at them and pointing their fingers at them is very, very <mod target = wrong>inappropriate</mod> behavior towards them.<br>Lastly, there should be more systems that help unmarried mother<ins>s</ins>. They should be protected. They should be safe and be able to study. However, it turns out that there are many unmarried mother<ins>s</ins> in Korea, but <ins>a </ins>very small amount of public shelters for unmarried mothers.

Schlitterbahn has also lots of fun rides<ins>,</ins> but they were not as fun as the ones in Aquatica. Although I did think that the rapids and waves at Schlitterbahn were the best in the whole country<del>,</del> because the rapids go all the way around the park. So<ins>,</ins> we didn't have to walk on the hot surface<ins>,</ins> and we could just relax and wait until we reached our destination. What I liked the most about the waves was that we didn't have to ride on a tube, but we could just go to the wave river without a tube<del>,</del> which is way better than staying on a tube. There was another thing that I really liked. It was a surfing ride. This ride is the only surfing ride in all of Kansas City. It was really fast and really fun. At the water park we ate some food<del>,</del> because we were getting really hungry. The food was amazing. I ate a foot long hot dog<ins>,</ins> and it was really a foot long. Usually<ins>,</ins> even if they say it's a foot long hot dog, it's really not a foot long or it's smaller, but the one I had at Schlitterbahn was really a foot long and<ins>,</ins> it was really delicious.

"1000":::"The day before yesterday<ins>,</ins> my host brother and I went to
 a football camp. It's not like soccer. It's American football. It 
involves tackling and passing with your hands. It is really fun. I used 
to play it every time I was in America. Anyway, we had about <mod target = 2>two</mod> weeks of camp. <del>TR&gt;</del>During
 the first week, I went for the quarterback position. The quarterback is
 the guy who is usually at the center of the game. He passes to the 
receivers and throws the ball to the running backs. So<ins>,</ins> it's the hardest job in the NFL<del>,</del> and also the highest paid job in the NFL. The camp starts at 8:30 and ends at about 12. We practiced running first<ins>,</ins>
 and then we split up into groups by position like quarterbacks, running
 backs, and receivers. In the quarterback group we practiced passing, 
did some passing and pitching drills, and then we grouped up with the 
receivers and running backs to do drills with them. It was really fun 
and hard. When we were all done we started doing 3 on 3 and 7 on 7 
drills. We made a team and had to do a punt, return, pass, score, and 
stuff like that. I was really good at it. During the second week I 
played the quarterback again, but this time we also practiced defense. 
In the first week it was a quarterback and receiver camp, but in the 
second week it was all combined, so there weren't a lot of people, which
 was a good thing. We got more chances to play. Of course we practiced 
running at first, and then all of the kids gathered around to listen to 
the coach<del>,</del> because defense is harder to play than offense. Then they showed us <del>how to </del>punt return, punt snap, punt block,<ins> and</ins> fumble recovery<del>, and etc</del>.
 I played the quarterback again and when playing defense I was the 
cornerback/safety. Except when playing defense, all the stuff was pretty
 much the same. We divided into the quarterback, running back, and 
receiver positions again. Then we practiced pretty much the same thing 
that we did during the first week, so it was really easy for me. When we
 played <mod target = 3 on 3>three on three</mod> and <mod target = 7 on 7>seven on seven</mod> I
 was usually blocking or playing the position of receiver. I was 
actually doing really well even though I wasn't really fast because I 
beat out one of the fastest kids that was at the camp<mod target = , so>. So,</mod> when I got my record sheet I had <mod target = a>the</mod> best score on making big plays and acceleration<del>,</del> and also really good scores for throwing and arm strength. I <mod target = think>thought</mod>
 that football camp was really fun. I had a good time with my host 
brother, and also had a really good time myself. I think that this 
football camp will be one of my best memories in America.":::

The limit for the amount of fish you can catch is 50. It was really cool that we were able to reach the limit. That's a lot of fish! The best thing of all was catching a catfish.

In the Amazing Spiderman, Spiderman doesn't shoot<del>s</del> spider webs from his hands anymore, he shoots them with the watch he mad. The strangest part of he movie was that the bully who bullied him became friends with Spiderman. The thing that I liked in the Amazing Spiderman is that they mentioned Spiderman's mother and father. Before they didn't say anything about Spiderman's parents, so I was always curious about that. The Amazing Spiderman also had a different villain. This villian is a reptile, and he is Spiderman's father's friend. Spiderman helped him with his new project<ins>,</ins> and they finally figured out about how to make hybrids.

"1041":::"13th of February. Weather: It's cool. I mean it's freezing.<br>""Tangled""<br><br>Hi! <br>Only <mod target = 3>three</mod> weeks left.<br>Well, maybe you guys asked your mothers at least once about going to the theater to watch the movie ""Tangled"". Well<ins>,</ins> in Korean it might be called Rapunzel. <br>Well, I didn't like the story that much<mod target = .<br>But>, but</mod> when I saw this movie's trailer<del>,</del> I liked the story for the first time. <del>Well </del>I admit that this story is funny<mod target = . And>, and</mod> maybe you guys will think that it's childish for teenagers, right? <mod target = But trust>Trust</mod> me<ins>,</ins> most of the teenagers will like it more than their little brothers.<br>Okay, today I watched this movie. It was funnier than I thought. Come on it scored 9.0 out of 10. Pretty high, huh?<br>Well<ins>,</ins> I didn't think that the man was telling the story about Tangled. Well<ins>,</ins>
 we should call him Flynn although his real name is Eugene. He is 
telling the story of how he met Rapunzel and about how she became the 
lost princess. Should I tell you about this? Come on<ins>,</ins> if I tell 
you this it won't be funny. Well, at least I can tell you this one thing
 about how this girl got magical hair 70 feet long that glows when 
somebody sings the spectacular song. There was a kingdom<ins>,</ins> and the queen 
was having a baby but she was sick, terribly sick. <mod target = And>Also,</mod> there was a 
golden flower created by the sun. It was magical<ins>,</ins> but it was cared for by
 the witch. She just sang and she became much younger<mod target = . But>, but</mod> the soldiers 
found the flower and fed it to the queen. Later, the princess was born 
with golden hair. One night the witch came to the sleeping princess and 
sang. The hair glowed<ins>,</ins> but when she cut part of it that part lost its 
power and turned brown. So<ins>,</ins> she kidnapped her and raised her in the 
tower. She always warned her that the outside world was dangerously full
 of egoists and cruel people. So<ins>,</ins> she believed the witch to be her mother<ins>,</ins>
 and she believed what she was telling her until she caught Flynn. Well<ins>,</ins> 
he didn't try to come to see her. He was just running away from the 
soldiers, actually the horse named Maximus. So<ins>,</ins> he saw the tower and went
 inside<mod target = . And>, and</mod> then they make a deal that if he shows her the lanterns in 
the sky (the kingdom always floats lanterns for the princess on her 
birthday) she will give him the crown that he stole. So<ins>,</ins> the story 
begins.<br>How was it? It was funny. I liked it. I don't like Disney 
princesses<ins>,</ins> but I like her. She is funny. Well<ins>,</ins> sometimes she looks 
childish and confused. <mod target = Same>It's the same</mod> with Flynn. What a great relationship! I 
like the part where Maximus tries to catch him<ins>,</ins> and she stopped him and 
trained him like a dog. It was funny. <br>I wonder if there will be a 
""Tangled 2."" It might be funny! Most sequels aren't funny<mod target = . But>, but</mod> I'm sure 
that this will be. ""Mulan 2"" was funny. I want to be like her. Really. 
Well<ins>,</ins> most people say that I am cute and look smart and confident<mod target = . But>, but</mod> 
you are wrong<del>~ hee..</del>. I am totally different. Well let's still say I am 
cute and smart. Confident? Let us think about it. I am childish. I 
exaggerate a lot of my actions<ins>,</ins> but sometimes I'm funny. Sometimes<ins>,</ins> I 
don't know why I do this. Maybe you will think that I am crazy<mod target = . But>, but</mod> 
trust me. One good thing about me is that I am pure. I don't know if I 
am as pretty as her<ins>,</ins> but we share many characteristics. What do you

I want to make some proper decisions to help achieve world peace. Actually, we all should. So<ins>,</ins> I want to choose a job that could help the poor people and nature. We need some proper decisions and we should put our ideas into practice. We can't make decisions all day<ins>,</ins> but not do anything--that would be useless, right? So, I want to be the president of the UN. It is my dream. I asked my mom, ""Is there is a job that would let me work for nature and help poor people?"" She told me I should be the president of the UN. So<ins>,</ins> my dreams are these. When I watched this program I had a strong feeling like this. What do you think?

Gap of Nature, not gap of my socks... <br>This book is about extinct animals<del>,</del> which have disappeared in the past 500 years. <br>There were lots of animals. The surprising thing was that there was lots of species of mice. The most common reason that they've become extinct is because of mice, cats, and white people (from Europe).

Mainly animals in Australia, 뉴칼레도니아, and especially birds in Hawaii were extinct.<br>There are lots of animals that have been disappearing for the past five hundred years. I was really sad. Only a few of them became extinct naturally, but the others were not. Tame animals like Forkland dogs became extinct. They were very tame<ins>,</ins> so people tricked them with meat and kill<ins>ed</ins> them. If I had been them<ins>,</ins> I would have rather raised them as my pets. There are 16 kinds of species of gazelles<del>,</del> and the red gazelle has become extinct. Blue antelopes, Christmas rats, and wallabies have also become extinct.

Usually in elementary school we compete with our families on sports day.But it's different in middle school. It is not with family anymore.

The second grade did basketball, and the third grade did kickball.<br>My class is one of the best sports classes in the first grade.So we were sure that we were going to win. I was chosen to be a player in my class. My bodyguard was a swimmer who won the silver medal in a Seoul swimming competition. <br>I practiced a ball game yesterday with my father.

"1082":::"Today, I will talk about this topic: why do people attend college or university? Well, if you graduate elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, but do not attend college or university, it's very hard to find a job. Nowadays, young people who have just graduated senior high school<ins>,</ins> <del>or </del>college<ins>,</ins> or university think they are just fine for big companies and factories. So, they don't want to do jobs like sweeping the floor or cleaning the stairs in big apartment buildings. Let's think about some examples. I said young people don't want to do dirty, dangerous, and difficult jobs. Sam graduated senior high school and he didn't go to college or university. He was very good at everything and he did well while he was a high-school student. However, he thought he was so good that he didn't have to go to college or university, so he did what he wanted to. When he tried to find a job to earn some money, he had no job for <mod target = 5>five</mod> years. Every company and every factory that he wanted to work at just wanted people that graduated college or university. Why? I think it's not very nice to judge a person by his or her grades and education. However, <del>the </del>society wants smarter and nicer people. So, we attend college or university to be the 'smart and nice person that society wants us to be'. Well, it's a pity and <mod target = I'm>I feel</mod> very sorry for Sam<mod target = ,>.</mod> <mod target = companies>Companies</mod> <del>just </del>can't know <del>about </del>everything about you and they have to know about you through things like grades and education. <mod target = Imaginate>Imagine</mod> that you are a company's CEO.

Well, I think I would choose the one that graduated from Harvard University. He might be very useful<del>,</del> because he had an excellent education at university<del> about what this company does</del>. He will need just a little training about selling something and no<ins>thing</ins> more. But, if you choose a person that graduated high school, you might need <ins>to use </ins>a long time to educate him for your company. However, it's not that he can't work like <ins>an </ins>average <mod target = people>person</mod>. If he has very good experience related to this work, he will be an Ace in that company.

Um...<del> </del>where do I have to start...<del>..</del><br>This book is more<ins> like</ins> a love story than fantasy or action. There is a vegetarian vampire family, the Cullens, who only drink (or eat) animal blood. So, they <mod target = are living>live</mod> like ordinary students going to Forks High School. But, Isabella (Bella Swan) moves to Forks where her father works in the town as a police officer. Her blood is extraordinarily tasty-smelling<del>,</del> and Edward Cullen, who is the same age as Bella, falls in love with her. Well, vampires are always so beautiful and magnificent so Bella falls in love with him<ins>,</ins> too, and they just go on dates or to parties. In book 2, 'New Moon<mod target = ',>,'</mod> the Cullens have Bella's birthday party at their house and she cuts her hand when she is trying to rip open the present. One of the Cullen family<ins> members</ins> goes out of control, nearly attacking and killing Bella.

However, Bella finds him in time and he leaves the Volturi. In book 3, 'Eclipse<mod target = ',>,'</mod> the vampire named Victoria wants to kill Bella<del>,</del> because the Cullens killed the vampire who was in love with Victoria<ins>.</ins> <ins>They killed him </ins>because he tried to kill Bella and almost turn<ins>ed</ins> her into a vampire.

Then, she realizes that she is pregnant and <del>by </del>risking her life, she gives birth to the half-human and half-vampire baby girl named Renesmee. Well, the Volturi tries to kill all immortal children (half vampire) <mod target = and>so</mod> the Cullens and werewolves fight with the Volturi because they want to protect the baby girl.

"1089":::"Hi<ins>,</ins> guys! Last week, I wrote about my favorite books which probably would have been very boring.<del>..</del> So today, I'm going to write about my favorite movies and American dramas (because my life is so boring<ins>,</ins> I have nothing <ins>else </ins>to write about<del> else</del>.) <br><br>So, my favorite American drama is 'Friends.' It ended more than 10 years ago<ins>,</ins> but it's still famous. It's a story about six friends: Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Joey, Ross<ins>,</ins> and Rachel. I love all of the characters because each of them has unique characteristics and lifestyles. But<ins>,</ins> if I have to rank them, I'll have to say I like Chandler the most. Chandler's main trait is his sarcasm. He makes the most jokes<ins>,</ins> which are usually sarcastic, and he used to work at a big computer company, but quit<del>s</del> and <mod target = becomes>became</mod> an advertiser. He marries Monica<del>,</del> and they adopt twins. Chandler was acted by Matthew Perry.<br>But<ins>,</ins> as I said, I love every character. Phoebe always says strange things which is hilarious. Rachel changes from being self-centered to caring for her friends. I love Jennifer Aniston (Rachel)<ins>,</ins> who is the most famous of the six people in Friends. Joey later becomes a famous soap opera actor. Ross never loses his obsession <mod target = to>for</mod> dinosaurs. Monica loves cleaning and always likes to win. <br>The second favorite American drama is 'Big Bang Theory.' I only started watching it recently<ins>,</ins> but I love it. The characters' names are a little confusing, but I like Sheldon<ins>,</ins> who is a genius<ins>,</ins> but frets over little things. I love the title song which ends <mod target = like>with</mod> 'but it all started with the big bang BANG!'<br>Next is Hannah Montana. I love Miley Cyrus<del>,</del> and I love the songs in Hannah Montana. It would really be fun to be a famous pop star and be an ordinary student at the same time.<br>Then<ins>,</ins> it's Modern Family. I like Luke<ins>,</ins> who is like his father; <mod target = while>when</mod> others ask 'Why?' Luke asks 'Why not?' <br>I also like Victorious. I love the songs. I think Ariana Grande is really talented. <br>I can't think of any other sitcoms...<del> :)</del> <br><br>Vacation's almost over. This weekend, I'm having a sleepover at my friend's house<ins>,</ins> which is in Suwon, where I used to live. I'm really looking forward to it. I just can't wait...

If you think you are a bookworm who can't live without books, (<mod target = By>by</mod> the way, I can live without books<del>.</del>) join me with this talk about 'books.'<br><br>Firstly, I'd like to talk about How to Kill a Mockingbird. But<ins>,</ins> it's not related to actually shooting mockingbirds. Mockingbirds symbolize innocent people who do no harm to <del>the </del>society. The prosecutor (also the narrator's father) says <ins>to </ins>never kill a mockingbird. The author talks about a few ""mockingbirds"" that die<ins>d</ins> <mod target = with>for</mod> no reason. The part where there was a trial <ins>on </ins>whether the black man was guilty or not was really interesting and fun to read. But<ins>,</ins> it was sad to see such discrimination between the blacks and the whites.<br><br>Now<ins>,</ins> I'd like to talk about The Catcher in the Rye<ins>,</ins> which I just finished a few days ago. This book was also fun to read (I can't read boring books). The story is about a boy who lives by himself for two days after he gets kicked out <mod target = by>of</mod> his fourth school. In the middle of the story, the boy, Holton, says that he wants to be a catcher in the rye<ins>,</ins> who catches children who are falling off the cliff. I think he is trying to say that he wants to guard children's innocence, which he believes he has lost. He loves his little sister, Phoebe<ins>,</ins> a lot and tries to protect Phoebe from losing her innocence. Holton goes back to his normal life and he ends the book by saying he misses his friends in his school. You should read this book.<br><br>Thirdly, I love the book Goose <mod target = girl>Girl</mod>. This is a fantasy series and I read this book more than three times. Isi has <mod target = a>the</mod> power to talk to animals and control <ins>the </ins>wind. Enna can control fire. Rin has the ability to control people by words. It's so cool. The author is Shannon Hale<del>,</del> and other Shannon Hale books are great<ins>,</ins> too. So<ins>,</ins> if you have a chance, read One Thousand Days and Princess Academy.<br><br>I also remember this book I began reading since<ins> the</ins> fourth grade. It's called Warriors. The author makes a world of cat warriors and the cats are just like humans. There's about 30 books in the Warriors series and it's totally worth it! But<ins>,</ins> if you finish the series, you will probably begin to talk to cats<ins>,</ins> which look<ins>s</ins> really stupid. <br><br>Other books I want to recommend <ins>to you </ins>if you are a young elementary kid: Maniac Magee, Fudge series, Ramona series, Hoot, Little House series, the Unfortunate Events series, and many others...<br><br>If you are really really young: the Magic Tree House series, the Arthur series, A to Z series, Junie B. Jones<ins>,</ins> and many others.<br><br>If you like fantasies: Eragon, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, <ins>and </ins>The Mysterious Benedict Society.<br><br>I'm going to end here.

"1117":::"These days, I have been very busy. I was confused about my English homework and I couldn't do the math homework! I had to stay at my math academy yesterday. Because of many reasons, I don't like my English academy. I can't say its name, but this academy is one of the biggest English academies in Korea. I think my academy doesn't care about its students and only tries to earn a lot of money. I hope my academy uses its resources more efficiently. <br><br>Yeah, that was my complaint. However, since the end of my final exams, I have continued to have peaceful days. I usually go from home to school to academy to home<del>,</del> and then the same thing again the next day. You may think that my lifestyle is very boring, but I'm a Korean student. This is why I'm happy about my life right now. I don't like exams. I like studying, but I hate taking tests. Preparing for an exam isn't bad<del>,</del> because I like to study. Well, I don't always like to study, only sometimes. Exams drive me crazy. One mistake? My entire grade will go down<del>,</del> and I can't forget about it. So, this is why I'm happy. For about a month, I don't have to care about studying. I'll just play and read many books. <br><br>Ah, books! My teacher gave us summer vacation homework. It is to read an English book everyday. I know it won't be easy. I'll borrow many books from the library and spend much time reading. I believe this will make be better at English. I <mod target = wish>hope</mod> to read many horror books in English this summer.

When I read the final book, I have to admit that I was awestruck at this author's brilliance and even felt a little shudder as I remembered how everything- even the smallest things - fit perfectly with each other.

In that case, the scene's background must depend on the director's imagination. <br>However, in some ways the movies are better than the books because they bring the books to life, especially in the scenes with some large-scaled move or attack. Sometimes, the director of the movie doesn't rely on the book<mod target = ;>,</mod> but creates his own story<del>,</del> and changes little details. <br>Today, I'm gonna show you how many things <mod target = were>have</mod> changed while making the movie, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2."" <br><br>----------------------<br>(<del> </del>I'm writing this on the assumption that you have watched the first part of this movie, which was released last year.<del> </del>)<br>Part 1 of the movie ended with Lord Voldemort finally tracking down the unbeatable Elder wand, which had belonged to the previous headmaster Dumbledore<del>,</del> and Voldemort laughing with delight as he grasps the Elder wand and lightning crackles down in the sky.<br><del>And, </del><mod target = if>If</mod> you look in the original book, the second part of the movie starts at chapter 25.":::

To do whatever you want to do. <br>Anyway, that's not the point.<br>During our English class, my teacher showed us a movie called ""The Day After Tomorrow.""<br>It is a movie about returning to the Ice Age. Here's the story:<br>Jack Hall is a <mod target = paleoclimatologist>climatologist</mod> on an expedition in <mod target = Antertica>Antarctica</mod> with his colleagues, Frank and Jason. They were drilling for more ice samples<ins>,</ins> when suddenly an ice shelf breaks in half and Jake almost falls to his death. Later<ins>,</ins> back in New Delhi, Jack presents his findings on global warming at a UN conference, but nobody <mod target = belives>believes</mod> <del>in </del>him, except for Professor Terry Rapson of the Scotland Climate Research Center. Professor Rapson believes in him<del>,</del> and he tells Jack that the temperature in several places in the North Atlantic simultaneously dropped 13 degrees Celsius below<ins> zero</ins>. Jack thinks that the Ice Age is coming, due to global warming. (When the Earth gets overheated, the Earth will try to get everything<ins> back</ins> in control<del>,</del> by cooling down the whole world's temperature. So, as the North Poles' ice melts, it will cause a reaction to start the Ice Age again.) Even though Jack originally thinks it will take at least a hundred years for the Ice Age to happen again, when his teams builds a forecast model with their combined data, the results show them that it'll take less than that, 6 to 8 weeks at most. <br>Around the world, the crazy weather system starts to bring mass destruction, such as a powerful <mod target = hailstrom>hailstorm</mod> striking <mod target = Tyoko>Tokyo</mod>, Japan, and a series of devastating hurricanes in Los Angeles, killing thousands of people. Spacemen are able to see a huge storm system spanning the northern hemisphere, which delays their return. Jack's theory about the Ice Age becomes a reality in seven to ten days time.<br>Meanwhile, Jack's son, Sam, is in NYC for an academic competition with his friends Brian and Laura. They also make a new friend, J.D.<del>.</del> The weather in NYC becomes very violent, with all super-power winds and tidal waves that hit Manhattan and cause major flooding which kills thousands of people in the chaos. Sam's friends run to the library, and seek shelter there. <del>And, </del>Jack promises his son that he'll rescue him and warns him to stay warm inside and not to go outside. <del>And, </del>Jack begins his expedition to New York with Jason and Frank. Frank dies on the way trying to save the others. They continue <ins>on </ins>their way. <br>At the library in New York, everyone is leaving the city in an attempt to survive. Sam <ins>tries to </ins>convince<del>s</del> them that they'll die if they go out, yet very few people listen. The remaining people light a fire and they stay, eating chocolate chips and snacks from the staff vending machine. Things get worse<del> ,</del> and Laura is <mod target = afflicated>infected</mod> with blood poisoning<del>,</del> and Sam and the others set out to get some penicillin to cure her leg. But<ins>,</ins> soon they are confronted by some hungry wolves, which escaped from the zoo and were hanging out, trying to find food (or even some humans, I think). <del>And </del><mod target = even>Even</mod> though they get caught at first, they successfully return from the hungry wolves. Soon<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>the eye of the <mod target = superstorm>super storm</mod><del>,</del> starts to freeze everything. (You should really watch this scene!<del>!!!</del> It's magnificent<del>,</del> and also scary. The whole city freezes from the top<del>,</del> and the frost starts to creep into the building. It was ironic that humans can escape from 'cold air', since it usually travels by the wind and humans cannot walk OR run faster than the wind. But<ins>,</ins> Sam somehow did, even though he was dragging the whole pack of necessary supplies.<del> </del>) <br>While Sam was desperately trying to keep warm in the eye of the <mod target = superstorm>super storm</mod>, Jack finally arrives in New York with Jason<del>,</del> and finds the public library half-buried in snow. <br><del>And, </del><mod target = finally>Finally</mod>, Jack and Sam meet at the fireplace of the library.

How do I start?<mod target = ....> </mod>Right.<br>All atoms have electrons and their orbits, right? <del>And </del><mod target = except>Except</mod> for 'rare gases<mod target = ',>,'</mod> all other atoms want to fill their orbits and stay stable. There are two ways to fill their orbits: covalent bonds and ionic bonds. (<del> </del>But<ins>,</ins> don't think<ins> that</ins> there are only two ways to make a compound! There are more.<del> </del>) <br>First of all, a covalent bond is characterized by the sharing of a pair of electrons between atoms or other covalent bonds. Take water for example... Yeah, water! W-A-T-E-R, water we drink, water we use, and water we cannot live without. Yeah, water is a covalent compound<del>,</del> made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom!<br>(Water is amazing! Its unique features keep us and even fish alive. I'd like to explain it to you now, but let's wait until later. I have to explain about making compounds.)<br>So, water's molecular formula is H2O<del>,</del> and that means that water molecules consist of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.<ins> </ins>Its degree of coupling is 120 degrees each. <br>Let me tell you how it happens. First, 'neutral' hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron. <del>And </del><mod target = you>You</mod> know,the first orbit of the atom (closest to the proton) is made when there are two electrons exercising. So<ins>,</ins> hydrogen atoms need one more electron to fill their first orbit. An oxygen atom, on the other hand, has eight electrons, and it needs two electrons to fill its second orbit. <br>Did I mentioned that nonmetallic atoms <mod target = LOVE>love</mod> to take electrons, but do not want to give them up? Well, now I did. It's really hard to take other's electrons without permission, right? <del>And </del><mod target = there>There</mod> is no 'left out for free' electrons for them to take. So<ins>,</ins> our dear hydrogen atoms (H for short) and oxygen atoms (O for short) meet and negotiate.<br><br>O: Hey, H! I need two electrons. Would you mind giving some to me?<br>H: Are you <mod target = KIDDING>kidding</mod>?<del>??</del> I have only one electron! You have eight. Give some to me. I want to stay safe.<br>O: No way, H, I want to fill my orbit! I don't want to give my precious electrons to you!<br>H: That's what I'm saying!<br>O: Well? There must be some way for us to both be satisfied without fighting.<br>H: How?<br>O: I've got it! You need one electron, and I need two electrons. So<ins>,</ins> you bring one of your friends now<mod target = ,> </mod>and then all three of us can be satisfied!<br>H: I don't know what you're saying, but...<del>...</del> Sure.<br>H's friend: Hi, dear Oxygen? H told me that you figured out a wonderful way to make us all good.<br>O: Sure, I do. First, I'll give you one electron each<del>,</del> and in exchange, you each give one electron to me. <br>H: Oh, that's good! I get the one electron I need<del>,</del> and you get the two electrons you want!<br>O: Let's do it.<br>(after a while)<br>H's friend: We changed!<del>!!</del><br>O: Yeah, what do we call ourselves?<br>H: Water.

I borrowed all of them <mod target = execpt>except</mod> for the third book.<br>Here is the main story<del> </del>: when a catastrophe is about to take place on <del>the </del>planet Earth, the Builders construct an underground city and bring 50 men, 50 women<ins>,</ins> and two babies for each couple. The Builders said that they should forget about their lives above the ground<del>,</del> and to keep their former lives as a secret from their children, so they don't wander around looking for the exit. In the underground city<del> -</del> called Ember<ins>,</ins> <del>- </del>everything seemed perfect with bright lights provided by hydroelectricity and food (from the Greenhouse and storage rooms full of cans)<ins>.</ins><br><del>And </del><mod target = finally>Finally</mod>, there is a document with instructions that the Builders left behind to prepare for the time when Ember becomes endangered. The document is called the Instructions for Egress, but it got lost by the seventh Mayor of Ember and no one knows about it.<br><mod target = Until>That is until</mod> Lina finds out and plans <ins>to find </ins>an exit from Ember with Doon.<br>In Lina's time, everything is lacking in Ember. The potatoes are diseased<del>,</del> and there are hardly any cans left for the citizens. Only privileged ones<ins>,</ins> such as food workers and the Mayor<ins>,</ins> have access to food, keeping the cans to themselves. <del>And </del><mod target = the>The</mod> light that supports Ember is beginning to flicker<del>,</del> and the people of Ember know that they are doomed. There are ""Believers,"" who believe that someone<ins>,</ins> <del>- </del>frankly, the Builders themselves<ins>,</ins> <del>- </del>will come and rescue them. <br>When Lina and Doon finally exit Ember through a secret hallway built by the Builders, they realize that their previous world was nothing but a small ball of light deep underneath the ground. <del>And, </del><mod target = they>They</mod> send the message to the remaining people of Ember<del>,</del> and the story ends there.<br>There are other cities like Ember in many books. Take ""The Giver<ins>,</ins>"" for example. <del>(</del>It is another one of my favorite books.<del>)</del> Jonas is living in a so-called utopia. The government controls everything: the food they eat, what dreams they have, what feelings they feel, etc. Since everything, almost everything, is controlled, they don't even feel anything about killing. The government calls it ""releasing"" and everyone takes that for granted.<br>Until, Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory, a special person who remembers all of the memories of the past, he doesn't even know anything is wrong. With the help of the last Giver, who gives Jonas all the memories, Jonas learns about everything: colors, wars, real happiness, and about killing.<br>Too shocked that everyone is ""releasing"" old people and weak babies mercilessly, Jonas leaves the town, thinking of a way to tell the people about real life and real emotions.<br>Well, both books are talking about cities made and controlled by the government. Everything is perfectly controlled, until someone tries to break the control. Some say <del>when </del>if another World War happens again<del>,</del> and after almost all<ins> the</ins> people die, there could be some country like that.<br>Well, what do you think?":::

Teacher's Day is this Sunday<del>,</del> and I think the cards should be delivered to them by Saturday. But, I'm of two minds on whether or not I should write a letter to Carlye.

"1149":::"Saturday, April 6<br>Weather: A little bit cold<del>,</del> and rainy.<br><br>Today is April 6th, the day after Children's Day!<br>What did you do on Children's Day?<br>Well, I'm not <mod target = at the>of</mod> age to celebrate Children's Day because I am no longer an elementary school student. I'm a middle school student<del>,</del> and what's more, I'm in my second year!<br>Everyone thinks that I should be in my home, studying. But, that wasn't my intention yesterday. <br>So, I went to Seoul Land!<br>I woke up at 5 A.M., got ready to play, ate a real quick breakfast, and went off!<del>!!</del><br>The weather was great: not cold, no rain, only warm weather perfect for playing.<br>The amusement park was not crowded, due to the early time I got there. <br>It was the perfect time to play. <br>Well, some say that you go to Seoul Land to see the other people, instead of riding the rides, but that was not what we did. <br>I rode about 6 or 7 rides in an hour, including the roller coasters, Magic Carpet and Goblin's Wind. <br>All of them were fun, especially Goblin's Wind (Top Spin)!<br>You sit on the ride and it twists itself, turning in a full circle and... <br>I cannot quite explain it. I wish I could upload some pictures. <br>The roller coaster was exciting, too. It circled, twisted, and dived with really fast speed. One bad thing about it was time. It was too short<del>,</del> and all the excitement goes away. It felt as if we would start, twist a little, and ding! It's already over. Thank you.<br><del>And </del>Shot X Drop was also really exciting. <br>The ride shoots up to 52 meters high and shoots back down. I love the feeling of it, like flying. I think the fact that there's no place to put your feet makes the ride more exhilarating.<br>I'll leave short comments about some more exciting rides.<br><br>1) King Viking<br>You should sit at the end. It doesn't go really high, but if you sit at the end, you'll still feel the thrill of the ride.<br><br>2)Flume Ride<br>Watch out for the camera! It takes your picture when your face is at its most vulnerable. Plus, don't forget to bring some towels! You will be sorry that you didn't bring it. You get soaking wet. <br><br>3)X Flyer<br>Wanna get the real excitement? Here we go<del>~</del>! It makes you scream. Not scary, yet. But<ins>,</ins> don't go too far. I've seen some kids who went too far and...<del>...</del> <ins>it's </ins>your <mod target = opinion>choice</mod>.<br><br>4) Bumper Cars<br>Learn to ride your car! I got trapped with others and wasted my precious time.<del> :(</del><br>Stress out<del>!</del>!<br><br>5) Zeppelin<br>When you feel like you're tired from all those other rides, try this. It makes you feel happy, tranquil<ins>,</ins> and peaceful. It makes you smile.<br><br>6) Rock Cafe<br>Listening to music<del>,</del> around and around! <br><br>7) Black Hole 2000<br>The ride twists twice<del>,</del> and there are seven dives! Don't put your glasses on. They can fly away. <br><br>8) Double Loop Coaster<br>It circles two times<del>,</del> and you don't have to take off your glasses. The centripetal force keeps your glasses from falling off. Plus, you will be able to enjoy the caves with winds and lightning sparking.<br><br>9) Motion Theater<br>I love penguins!

Well<ins>,</ins> <mod target = REALLY>really</mod> unlucky penguins, starting all their adventures with just one slip. <mod target = SOOOOOOOO>So</mod> cute!<del>!!!</del><br><br>10) Crazy Mouse<br>The most thrilling of all the rides. Stress out!<br>Sorry. That was a complete joke. It's a mini roller coaster for really small kids.<br><br>There was a lot more<del>,</del> and I'm sorry I cannot explain them all. Anyway, it was really fun.<br>When we came back home, it was 10 P.M. I just collapsed on<ins> to</ins> bed and today, spent all day sleeping and watching TV. <br>Anyway, it was a wonderful day<del>,</del> and I'm thankful to my mum for waiting all those times in line for us to play and let us do all this joyful stuff!":::

Well, to be honest, going out in rainy weather is totally not a good idea these days.<del>)</del> I'm going to read some English books<ins>,</ins> such as ""A Corner of the Universe"" or ""Stargirl"" and many others.

Guided by the camp's staff, we could see our apartment, the place we were to stay during our time in the Song-am Space Center. In our 'room<mod target = ',>,'</mod> there were two floors, and on the top floor, half of the ceiling was glass. The glass was transparent so we could see the stars shining when we lay down. I have never seen anything like that. It was magnificent. <br>As soon as we put down our bags and gathered together, the teachers divided all of us into two group<ins>s</ins> and started the activities. I was in 'A' group, so the first part of my program was drawing <ins>a </ins>glow-in-the-dark celestial map. I was a little disappointed by the result because all I could do was <del>to </del>mark the sites of important stars, such as Sirius, Polaris<ins>,</ins> and Altair. It was boring<del>,</del> and teachers didn't let us take the activity paper we made. It was really annoying. I wanted to put it up <mod target = on>in</mod> my room and enjoy the glowing of important stars. After that, we saw a 3D-movie. If it's supposed to be a 3D-movie, you should wear some sort of special glasses or the screen will be all blurry. But<ins>,</ins> this was nothing like that. Do you know about planetariums? <br>A planetarium is a theater that is shaped like a hemisphere<del>,</del> and you go in and ""sit."" (Even though, ""lay down"" is more accurate, you cannot say that you laid down on the chair. It seems ridiculous.) The screen is also hemisphere-shaped and when you look at it, it feels so real. It's much nicer than a regular 3D-movie because you don't have to wear those glasses<del>,</del> and a regular 3D-movie doesn't make you feel like you're a part of the scene that is playing on the screen.

Sponsoring 2 kids costs 90<ins>,</ins>000 won a month. It is surprising how she would pay that much money for children she never met in person. It is not only money<ins>,</ins> but also her compassion and love towards the children that touched me. <del>And </del>I was happy that there are still people who would help others no matter what. I promised myself that I will sponsor a needy child when I get enough allowance to do so (I only get 20<ins>,</ins>000 <mod target = Won>won</mod> a month. Excuse Moi!). Anyways, I'm glad that I applied for this volunteer work and found out about this amazing girl. Thank you<ins>,</ins> Compassion<ins>.</ins> <del>:)
