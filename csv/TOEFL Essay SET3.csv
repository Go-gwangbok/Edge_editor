322&What are some of the qualities of a good parent? Use specific details and examples to explain your answer.":::"There are many factors <ins>used</ins> to evaluate the qualities of a good parent.

422&Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree?

Some professors prepared <del>for </del>their own evaluation paper for themselves because they thought it helped them review their teaching method and attitude for students. I think evaluating teachers is useful not only for teachers but also for students; it improves teaching method<ins>s</ins> and facillitates communication between teachers and students. Also, we can use the result of it as a standard for teacher promotion. Thus, I agree school<ins>s</ins> should ask students to evaluate their teachers. <br><br>First, teachers can know what their students need.

Maybe</mod> they speak too fast or students don't have enough time to ask questions. However, if teachers have an open-minded attitude, they would positively adopt such basic needs and try to cope with such problems next time. <br><br>Second, once teachers and students evaluate each other, they can communicate more easily. The relation<ins>ship</ins> between teachers and students is unilateral<mod target = ;>.</mod> <mod target = people>People </mod>only think of a teacher as a<ins>n</ins> instructor and a student as a learner.

In this essay, I will give a detailed explanation of my viewpoint.<br><br>First of all, let's think about reasons why Sejong is the greatest person. Before him, we used Chinese. Our spoken language did not match with the written language. Because we, above all, can say that one language is the reflection of one culture, we were under the control <mod target = by>of the </mod>Chinese culture. So<ins>,</ins> the creation of <ins>the </ins>Korean language was a starting point for us to be independent <mod target = of>from </mod>China. The Korean language, Hangul, has been evaluated as the most scientific one, so that in Korea there are few people who are illiterate. Therefore, it is natural that we should honor him.<br><br>It's time to devise lots of events or methods in which we celebrate Hangul Nal. First, I want to conduct the campaign for the purpose that Korean<ins>s</ins> should love Hangul more than in the past, and use it exactly. Second, we should make use of the day as a chance to recollect our history especially the days when <ins>the </ins>Korean language was created. The situation was unfavorable because of the disturbance by China. Third, on the day, we should enhance education because the students <del>of </del>nowadays do not know how Korean was created, or how difficult the creation was. These events could make us more patriotic.<br><br>The reason that I want to make a holiday does not lie only in <mod target = personal one that I>my </mod>respect <ins>for </ins>Sejong. Rather, the most important one is that all the people who live in Korea could be patriots with the the good use of Hangul Nal. This day could give great impressions on our hearts<mod target = . And>, and</mod> we could have a new chance to know who we are<del>, and to run toward the world</del>. Hangul Nal would be the most meaningful day of all.":::

442&People recognize a difference between children and adults. What events (experiences or ceremonies) make a person an adult? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.":::"I don't believe that just age is enough to define an adult. Being an adult also requires <ins>someone</ins> to be mentally mature. In this respect, what makes a person an adult is traveling alone and experiencing a funeral. <br><br>Perhaps traveling alone is one of the most important events that make people adults. It helps people improve the spirit of independence. It gives them chances not only to deliberate about themselves, but also to enhance their spirit of independence with which they can solve a lot of problems for themselves. When I took a trip alone to Europe as a freshman, I couldn't express myself at first because of a language barrier. Through trial and error, however, I gain<ins>ed</ins> confidence in myself, which maybe a factor of being an adult.<br><br>Besides traveling alone, the funeral ceremonies cause people to be adults. Accepting <ins>the</ins> death of a person, they might reflect <ins>upon </ins>their lives and begin to think of their lives seriously. When my father died three years ago, I felt responsibility to lead my family instead of my father and thought that I should not be no <mod target = linger>longer be </mod>a child.<br><br>To sum up, it is traveling alone and experiencing the funeral that makes a person an adult.

Likewise, practicing sports helps young children get along with other children.<br><br>On the other hand, practicing sports also has the other side of the coin.

I completely agree with the above statement for three reasons.<br><br>One reason I like to be a member of a group is <mod target = not >so that I don't have </mod>to worry about matters like decision making. As a leader<ins>,</ins> you will be required to make <ins>a </ins>decision alone and let members obey what you <ins>have </ins>decided. Your decision, however, can't satisfy every member's preference so that they may complain and even say a bad word about you. In my <mod target = highschool>high school</mod>, I was one of the class leaders and that one year was a very hard time for me.

So<ins>,</ins> I prefer to be a member.<br><br>Second reason is that I don't want to waste time as a leader. Leaders <mod target = has >have </mod>a lot of things to prepare, discuss, and practice.
