105&High schools should require all students to wear school uniforms.":::"Many people believe that schools should allow students to choose what they want to wear to school in terms of respecting their personality.

In my opinion, students should wear school uniforms in high schools because wearing uniforms is advantageous <mod target = to their financial as well as learning>financially and educationally</mod>.<br><br>First of all, wearing uniforms helps students save a large amount of money. It is because they don't need to buy a variety of clothes. <mod target = Especially, since>Since</mod> teenagers are easily affected by friends and fashion, they would like to buy expensive clothes or brand new products.

Moreover, it would be <ins>a</ins> heavy burden for poor students to buy several clothes and some students would feel a sense of incongruity. In my personal experience, I <mod target = should have worn>wore</mod> a school uniform for two years in high school.

Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in modern apartment building?""":::"Since 1990, man<del> </del>y apartments have been constructed here and there in my country. Some people say that the reason why the number of apartments is drastically increasing in our society is <del>that </del>because our country is very small and the population is exponentially expanding, <ins>making </ins>the apartment <del>is </del>an appropriate housing form <mod target = to ours>for us</mod>. However, I believe that there are more specific reasons that although a lot of money is needed to buy<del> a house in</del> an apartment, people strongly want to live <del>in </del>there and try to make sufficient money very hard to purchase their own house, and I want to delve into some of the most significant ones here.<br><br>One of the most essential elements for this issue it that living in the apartment provides a plethora of convenience and comfort for people. In terms of the convenience, many facilities are concentrated in or near the apartment such as grocery store<ins>s</ins>, fitness center<ins>s</ins>, kindergarten<ins>s</ins>, and even department store<ins>s</ins>. So, residents do not need to go far away to buy something, exercise, or raise children. Moreover, because there is <ins>an</ins> enormous<del>ly</del> broad<del>en</del> parking lot, people do not worry about finding <mod target = the>a </mod>space to park their cars. In view of the comfort, the apartment has a good heating and cooling system, which is very important in my country because summer is too hot and winter is very cold. People can regulate proper temperature<ins>s</ins> <mod target = of>in </mod>the<ins>ir</ins> house<ins>s</ins> by clicking several buttons or even operating an auto<ins>matic </ins>temperature regulating system. On the contrary, as the traditional house uses the classic<del>al</del> heating method to control room temperature using fire and usually has the structure to be hard to use the cooling system using air conditioner. According to a recent study released by the Korean National Research Center, more than four-fifths of the surveyed people who moved from traditional house<ins>s</ins> to apartment mentioned that the main reason to transfer to <ins>a</ins> new house is that it is more convenient and comfortable to live in <ins>an </ins>apartment. Therefore, it is evident that <ins>the </ins>apartment provides better circumstances for people.<br><br>Another reason that must be considered is that there are more opportunities to get along with others. Apartment complex<ins>es</ins> <mod target = is>are </mod>so large that a numerous number<ins>s</ins> of people live there, and there are various organizations, clubs<ins>,</ins> and even just gatherings. Thus, people can have many chances to contact <del>with </del>other people for the various purposes.

Unlike teachers at school, parents don't expect extra money or raise<ins>s</ins> in their salaries when <mod target = we>they</mod> teach us.

For these lonely people, <ins>a </ins>dog can be a best friend at any time. For example, my grandmother has lived alone since my grandfather passed away. My family wanted to live with her in Seoul, the biggest city in Korea, but she did not <ins>want to</ins> leave her home in <ins>a</ins> rural area.

To illustrate, I watched a television program about the Golden Retriever, the speciallized breed for blind people.

In this essay, I will give a detailed explanation of my viewpoint. <br><br>First, let's think about the reasons why we should <mod target = first >ful</mod>fill <del>up </del>the basic needs of <ins>the </ins>common people. Nowadays computer technology<ins>,</ins> with the help of <mod target = an>the </mod>internet<ins>, </ins><mod target = have>has </mod>great influences on unifying cultures. <mod target = And>Also, </mod>it is not an exaggeration that the level of computer technology is the standard of living <mod target = of>in </mod>one country. However, many countries that are located in Asia or Africa do not utilize high technology because their level of basic <mod target = lives>existence </mod>is excessively low. Thus, high technology that does not entail the meeting of basic need is useless. It is an inevitable conclusion that high technology must follow the investment in the basic needs of common people.<br><br>After the basic needs that are essential to develop an industry are satisfied, government should spend <mod target = much>a lot of </mod>money on buying computer technology. The world is linked by computer technology<mod target = . And>, and</mod> even universities <del>co-</del>work with those of other countries and share their knowledge. All of these activities cannot be executed without the help of computer technology. The world revolves around the country with <del>a </del>high computer technology. Hence, without the investment in computer technology, our country would at last fall into ruins in the future. The more one country develop<ins>s</ins>, the <mod target = higher>more </mod>technologies are demanded.<br><br>Two factors are also important because of the reasons I have previously stated. <mod target = But>However, </mod>government<ins>s</ins> should bear in mind that our goals do not lie in the happiness of a few people, but in <del>that of </del>all<ins> of</ins> the people. We should run to the development which requires high technology<mod target = . But>, but</mod> it is more urgent to meet the basic need<ins>s of people</ins>. Thus, government<ins>s</ins> should first spend <mod target = much>a lot of </mod>money on <mod target = answering>supplying </mod>more basic needs<mod target = , then on> rather than</mod> buying computer technology.

422&Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree?

Also, we can use the result of it as a standard for teacher promotion.

In this essay, I will give a detailed explanation<del>s</del> of my viewpoint.<br><br>First of all, we have much more knowledge today than in the past. The computer technologies with the help of <ins>the </ins>internet make the world smaller. We share knowledge with the people who live in other countries. Universities, companies, and laboratories <mod target = co-work>work together</mod> with those of other countries. So much knowledge is always near us that if we do not have skills to choose the best one that is crucial for us, we would obtain the result of going against the times. In a short time we should read an article, and find an answer or create <mod target = another>more </mod>knowledge. Therefore, the ability to single out knowledge, <del>that is, </del>the skill of reading fast<ins>,</ins> is very important.<br><br>Secondly, the ability to make ourselves understood is critical. <mod target = The society>Society</mod> is getting more complex, and the competition more severe. We should get a job, and introduce ourselves to others. To make a resume<del>,</del> and a letter of recommendation requires the skills to express ourselves more accurately. Therefore, <del>the </del>writing skills are essential to make ourselves pronounced. Moreover, to produce a good result we should have more information about companies and our rivals, which also calls for the reading skills. Thus, the ability to read and write is more important today than in the past.<br><br>We should remember the fact that other people estimate us by means of our ability of expression. If we have much knowledge but lack the useful techniques to make ourselves and our knowledge that is in a brain known, all the information or knowledge is useless. <mod target = And even>Even</mod> knowledge in our brain could not be obtained without the help of the reading skills. Therefore, we should improve the ability to read and write.<br><br>So far, I have explained about why we should <mod target = uplift>improve </mod>the ability to read and write. As I have previously stated, we cannot get along without this ability. It is <ins>a </ins>prerequisite for us to survive in a modernized society. Therefore, we always exert our energy to enhance the skills such as making ourselves known effectively, and get information without wasting time. If we could equip ourselves with these skills, we would be well-rounded global leaders.":::

When they raise a child, they sometimes complain about their children'<ins>s</ins> mistake<ins>s</ins> or bad <mod target = habbits>habits</mod>. Whenever they scold their children<mod target = .>,</mod> their family <mod target = break down>falls apart</mod> step by step. I know a person who <mod target = have >has</mod> a bad boy. He, however, understand<ins>s</ins> the boy. He thought <ins>at</ins> first like this<ins>:</ins> What is the reason <ins>why </ins>that <del>the </del>boy act<ins>s</ins> badly<mod target = .>?</mod> Finally<ins>,</ins> he can understand the boy<mod target = >and</mod> then he <mod target = forgive >forgave</mod> the boy. In that case, the boy <mod target = alway >always</mod> thinks <ins>of </ins>himself again. I think that it is essential thing to be a good friend.<br><br>Second, <ins>a </ins>parent must have love. As many people already know, if someone <mod target = were >was</mod> the richest person in the world, he <mod target = should >would</mod> think that he could <mod target = do >have</mod> everything except <del>the </del>emotion<ins>s,</ins> including love. It is <mod target = definately >definitely</mod> right. He cannot buy love. If parents want <ins>him </ins>to be a good man, they must have love. In <mod target = korea >Korea</mod> <ins>there is a </ins>saying, <ins>""</ins>A good family consists of love between parents and their children.<ins>""</ins> If parents have love, the children grow <mod target = rightly>up well</mod>. In other words, the children will not be a bad person such as <ins>a </ins>murder<ins>er</ins><del> </del>, robber<ins>,</ins> and so on. <br><br>Third, but not least, parents <ins>should </ins>never struggle <ins>with</ins> each other. <ins>The </ins><mod target = Father >father</mod> and mother <mod target = is >are</mod> the <mod target = base >foundation</mod> of the family. If they fight each other all the time, their children learn from <ins>their</ins><br>parents about the<ins>ir</ins> <mod target = struggling>struggles</mod>. When their children grow up and they are <ins>of</ins> <mod target = profit >proper</mod> age to go <ins>to </ins>elementary school or <mod target = higher >secondary</mod> school, their children's first <mod target = doing is>act will be</mod> fighting with their <br>friends, not study<ins>ing</ins> <mod target = their >the school</mod> subjects. It is <ins>a</ins> very important <mod target = things>thing</mod>. Fighting each other is a kind of evil to <del>the </del>young people. <br><br>In summary, being a good parent is <ins>a</ins> difficult thing. However<ins>,</ins> parents have <del>a </del>essential things such as <ins>an</ins> open mind, <ins>give</ins> love to the children<ins>,</ins> and <ins>do </ins>not <mod target = fighting>fight</mod>. <mod target = In >There're</mod> <mod target = korea >Korean</mod> saying<ins>s</ins>, <ins>""</ins>The famous person <mod target = alway >always</mod> produce <del>in </del>a good family<ins>""</ins>  and <ins>""</ins>The good family <ins>is</ins> <mod target = makes >made</mod> up of love <ins>for </ins>each other<ins>.""</ins> I strongly agree <ins>with </ins>these sayings.
