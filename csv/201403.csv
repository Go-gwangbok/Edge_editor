What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.":::"As more and more people are seeking after a job where it offers a fine salary, people begin to realize that having a good supervisor is another important fact when considering for a job. In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. However, I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.<br><br>For starters, good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees promote faster and that is what they do in their position at work. In addition, this not only make the employees enhance their positions but paves the way to make company a better reputation by having good leaders. For example, my older sister, who finished graduate school, got a job where it gives enough salary. Afterwards, my sister had a supervisor who had a very strong leadership. Since the boss led my sister very well with good judgement and nice advices, she promoted much faster than her friends from graduate school. This implies that strong leadership is a very important characteristic of a good supervisor.<br><br>Secondly, friendly leader is probably what the all employees are wishful to have at their work place. This is because most of the workers from all over the world suffer from stresses at work because of high pressure from boss or because of unfriendly environment.However, if a leader is very friendly, that will create much comfortable atmosphere where all of the employees can work with such enjoyment and that will eventually lead to a long term work. To be more detailed, there was a survey among the workers from renowned company about the reason why they work in the long term. Not surprisingly, about half of them answered because of the high name value of the company, but other half of them responded that it is because of good leaders who are very friendly. This definitely implies the important quality of a good supervisor is a amiable personality.<br><br>On the whole, even though the jury is still out, I firmly believe that having a good leadership and friendly personality is the most significant traits among others because of faster promotion and enjoyable atmosphere at work.":::

What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.":::"""Many people have a tendency to watch sports game on TV. There are many people watch them, although they are televised at late night. In addition, people who do not watch them last night used to check the result of game in the morning through the Internet and newspaper, not to mentioned news. It is a good material to have a conversation with others in school and workplace. In this sense, playing sports has an influence on our daily life and I think that it is helpful to improve the quality of our life owing to a character that includes some important lessons.<br><br>First of all, people can learn various skills that are useful for them to adapt to their life. Because of the fact that human beings are social animal, if they are isolated from their society, they would feel stressed and turn bad or violent, not communicating with others. For this reason, it is very important for them to live in their society. By playing sports, we can get a cooperation skill and social skill that are essential for us. Playing sports is not a survival game, but one of the methods of conversation that makes it possible for them to understand each other.<br><br>Secondly, the advantage of playing sports games is that we can learn sportsmanship, which is called the spirit of fair play. Today, a huge number of games are held, with fixed rules demanded. Soccer game is a very popular game all over the world. However, it sometimes causes terrible accidents that take place in playing field. It is not right. Not only is it an illegal behavior, but also it deserves to be criticized. The most important thing is not the result of the game, not player's attitude. Players have to respect other players, do their best and play fairly.<br><br>In conclusion, as I just mentioned above, playing sports games provides people with valuable lessons about their life.""":::

You have received a gift of money. The money is enough to buy either a piece of jewelry you like or tickets to a concert you want to attend. Which would you buy?":::"""Some people may think that purchasing jewelry would better than attending a concert. The jewelry could be valuable in realistic. However, I strongly recommend visiting the concert instead of buying a piece of jewelry for two points.<br><br>First point is that people hardly need worrying about losing memories. A piece of jewelry would make people worry about losing it. Because of these worries, people can suffer from their mental stress. On the other hand, the memory is not going anywhere. Moreover, the impression that people could get from the concert would makes people happy. With the help of the concert, people could refreshed and concentrate in their work much better by relieving stress form daily life. For example, when people get a lottery, they might be happy at first. However, there is a chance that it could be stolen or lost. So that people could not help worrying. On the other hand, if I attend exciting concert, I could recharge myself and get rid of stress. With this aspect, the memory of concert allows me pay attention to my work better.<br><br>The other point is that people can find their new interest by attending concert. When people attend the concert, the singer's feather could be one of attractive things. Thus, it can promote people's interest naturally. In contrast, a piece of jewelry hardly promotes people's interest. The impression that people get from it is only beautiful or pretty. For instance, my favorite singer played the guitar at his concert one year ago. I was so impressed that I started to practice playing the guitar after the concert. Nowadays, playing a guitar becomes one of my hobbies. For this reason, attending concert could let me find my interest.<br><br>To sum up, I firmly recommend that people should attend the concert rather than make a purchase of a piece of jewelry. Even thought it could be a valuable, I can get stressed by worrying about losing it. In contrast, I can get helpful memory and find another interest by attending a concert.<br><br>""":::

The ability to read and write is more important today than in the past. Do you agree or disagree?":::"""A lot of controversy exists over whether the literacy ability is more significant nowadays than in the past. Some might disagree with the given statement because the advent and development of literacy was greatly improved in the past than today. Personally, however, I firmly think that reading and writing skill becomes increasingly more Â important these days for several reasons. First of all, the employment competition is boosted now. Not only that, but people usually use the Internet in their daily routines. The following statements will support the opinion.<br><br>More than anything else, people are more competitive than before because it is difficult to find the job. In modern society, people are likely to work at the company rather than just doing agriculture living in hometown like in the past. Thus, they have to put much effort on improving their reading and writing capability to get into preferred workplace. As a result, the ability to read and write plays more crucial role in improving people's life. According to a study recently released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two thirds of CEOs of the corporations responded that they regard reading and wrting skill importantly because it is necessary in working.Based on the research, they insisted that second-language is also important in global world. As this example demonstrates, it is no doubt that the literacy competitiveness is much more important than before.<br><br>Besides, the technological development leads people to boost reading and writing skill. Obviously, it is true that some people still enjoy off-line lives. However, current trend is using internet at shopping, doing assignments and communicating with others. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the literacy capability is required to modern people to use the Internet which is based on reading and writing. To illustrate, one of my friends Jessica is works on the net, not commuting to and from the work. Also, she shop around the Internet shopping malls with easy access to computer. Furthermore, she communicate with her parents who lived far away by e-mail. Without the literacy talent, she would not be able to live conveniently and effectively. In this sense, people these days should have the talents on reading and writing due to the development of technology.<br><br>As I have argued, I strongly believe that the capability of reading and writing is more importnat than before. This is due to the fact that competitive society and technological development. Given this, it is quite obvious that modern people need the skill how to read and write than in the past.""":::

""Today, life is easier and cozier than it was when our grandparents were young. Do you agree or disagree?""":::"""Some people may argue that the generation of our grandparents was much easier and more comfortable to live. However, for the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8000 years, there have been significant changes. Adam and Eve became seven people population of people. Along with the growth in the number of population, growth in technology and income has blossomed as well. Therefore, I strongly believe that life in my period of time has much better condition than the generation of grandparents'.<br><br>Modern society has created a number of inventions that people only dreamed of in the past. People in the past had to do the laundries with their bare hands, spend time to wash their dishes, walk or ride horses to get to the destination, and sleep on the hard ground. Yet, those are the conditions that the people in nowadays cannot even imagine living in. There are washing machines that do our laundries, dish washers that brighten our dishes, cars and airplanes that allow us to travel around the world within a day, and beds that provide comfortable environment for us to have sweet dreams. Nevertheless, there is an even better invention that distinguishes our lives from those of grandparents'; the Internet. It has made our lives prosperous and easy. Thanks to the Internet, we can now shop clothes, furniture, and even groceries online. No one is required to leave their houses to purchase. Moreover, the Internet contains not only the shopping mall, but also the entertainment. It provides us with great games, movies, and dramas. Basically, everything that required labor force in the past is now possible without it due to the help of the Internet.<br><br>The internet and other developments have done a lot to enhance my generation's living condition, but economic growth has done tremendous job to enrich the living environment. For example, my grandfather is a war veteran who fought in Korean War. The growth domestic product per person back then was less than a dollar, whereas the current GDP per person in Korea is over 20,000 dollars. With this great advancement in economic growth, people can now afford products such as cars, cozy houses, and clothes.<br><br>I feel grateful for my grandparents and the ancestors beyond them for letting me enjoy the abundance of this generation. Even though nothing lets me to live an immortal live, it is evident that remarkable development in technology and extensive growth in income permit my generation to live in better quality of lives than that of grandparents'. Therefore, I am strongly against the statement that our grandparents had better quality of live than our generation.""":::

""Which do you prefer working alone or working with a team?

""":::"""Co-working and collaboration are hot issues today. The society is more complex than before which means that there is no definitive answer for problem solving in these days. Thus, we need to listen carefully and to understand deeply the other's voices. It looks like that takes more time and more effort compared to single persons' problem strategies. However, this is right approach, if we consider future risks.<br><br>Collective Intelligence contains diverse aspects. As mentioned previous paragraph, there are lots of stakeholders even in single and small events today. Thus, these different voices might be future risks. So far, in the process of the problem solving and gathering ideas, we need a time for listening from various opinions from various stakeholders. Let's assume the road construction project, if local government do this project by top-down approach, this would make severe problems between local residents and users; If local government does not consider 'noisy', 'natural resources', and 'congestion', local people might make some protest for that. So far, construction period will be delayed or even possibly canceled. Thus, working together and listening the diverse voices are short-cuts to make effective accomplishment.<br><br>Secondly, one plus one is more than two. This sentence looks too common. However, it contains lots of meaning. Let's assume the participatory discussion and debate in company; brain storming and mind-mapping are good examples. Through these kinds of events, the participants easily get the other's ideas and develop their idea by assistance from the others. In other words, we can find positive-leverage effects by working together. Definition of knowledge, which has been changed, is more worthy in case of spreading out to the others.<br><br>Sum up, everyone knows that to think alone and do alone is faster than working together. I firmly believe that it is not right approach. I repeatedly said that we need to consider more diverse aspects and various voices. Today, leader is not only one person. Meaning of leader is changed as like facilitator. Therefore, team members work together and think together to find a right solution; this is more proper approach in complex society.<br><br>""":::

""The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.

""":::"""Some people say that it is important to cooperate with others well today than in the past. However, on the other hand, I think that it is more important in the past than now to cooperate with people for the following reasons : people were not able to make up their living if they do not cooperate and because they have neighbours very close to them, it was important to cooperate. <br><br>First of all, it was important to cooperate with others to help out each other when they need some help. This is due to the fact that people had to make all things by themselves at that time and those works required a lot of labor sometimes like when you are building a house or planting rice. It was not easy for them to do those things by themselves as it took lots of time and effort. To be specific, there was a research done by Seoul National University showing comparison between the past and now how things got simpler and easier by the technology development. They found out that almost all works could be done with all sorts of machines. There was hardly a thing that could not be done. People now do not have to depend on somebody else to help them with any kinds of work and therefore the importance of cooperating with others is weaken.<br><br>In addition, it was important to cooperate and keep a good relationship with neighbours in the past. This is attributed to the fact that people usually lived in a village, their houses side by side. Because they see each other very often and people at that time did not move their homes easily, it was common for people to live with their neighbours next to them for entire life. To be specific, if they had not keep a good relationship, they would have lived a stressful life because they see one another as many times as they see their family members. Unlike in the past, now many people live in an apartment building, only have a few neighbours in each floor and they hardly see each other as they are busy with their own lives. There was a survey done by some apartments asking how many times they see their neighbours and how close they are with them. The result was that there were people even did not know who lived next door and they were not usually close with them, just showing basic curtesy by simple greetings. This implies that because people in the past lived their lives with their neighbours close, it would have been important to cooperate with them in order to live happy lives.<br><br>In brief, although the ability to cooperate is important now, there were more needs of this ability in the past to make up their living easy and to live happy lives with the neighbours living next door.<br><br>""":::

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.":::"""Games have positive effect not only on children but also on adults. Sometimes violent computer games make people aggressive and commit some illegal affairs. However, games are not a petty or frivolous thing even to adults.<br><br>First, adults can get along with others and relieve stress as children do so. When using the word, âgame,' we use âplay' as a verb. âPlaying' is the human natural behavior and all of us naturally learn how to play by ourselves. By playing games, people form social relationship with friends, teachers, and their families. It is not merely example for children. Especially, when adults get stressed out from their working places or relationships with others, they can relieve stress by playing games such as basketball or baseball games. In my case, I usually play computer games with my friends when I get stressed out from study. It makes me forget some bad things temporarily and gives a chance to get along with my friends.<br><br>Secondly, adults can feel a sense of achievement when they win the game. Most games have the competitive characteristic. Games have certain rules, and players should follow and obey these rules in order to win the game. From the start of a game, people begin the game with the same condition. However, when proceeding the game, they meet difficulties and they may have competitive spirit to defeat someone else. Under fair rules, people lies on the competition in good faith. This good competitive spirit has a positive effect on their life and outside of the game as well. In the end of the game, we can feel joyful emotions and it stimulates our motivation more synergetic when we win others or get a higher score in a game.<br><br>In conclusion, the positive effects of games are not limited only to children. Adults should have some free time when they get stressed out. Playing games can be a prescription for today's lethargic adults.""":::

It is not desirable for teachers to express their view on social or political issues views in class. Do you agree or disagree?":::"""Nowadays role of teachers has tremendous importance in our lives. Opinions are divided over this statement that showing view political and social issues in class is not good for teacher. I do not agree with this statement for two reasons. First, teacher can help student to understand well about social or political issues by showing their opinions with many media sources' view. Secondly, student can be competitive.<br><br>More than anything else, I think teacher only can help student to understand social and political issues. Â Teachers' main role is to convey knowledge to students, so they are able to mention well-balanced view by integrating their own thinking and other authors' view about social and political. Therefore it will be helpful for student to have opportunity to be well informed about current society's issues. Let me suggest example that can support my claim. I had a chance to travel to Africa continent few years ago. I was highly shocked that numerous people were suffering from starvation and AIDS. Even many children were in malnourished and had little or no access to education. I could not comprehend why these innocent people had to live in such detrimental conditions. So I sought out various sources about it on the Internet to learn more about as to the issues. There were conflicting views opinions in articles. Some news blamed first world countries for not providing enough aid to impoverish countries. Other pointed the finger at the civil wars among ethnic group in African continent. Thus, I could not understand which view is right. Â Some days after, history teacher expressed his opinion regarding this issue, and suggested other experts â perspectives in class. As a result, I was able to better understand the situation in a balanced view. As my experience shows, teacher can help student to comprehend current issue well. <br><br>In addition, students are able to enhance their debating skills through discussion with teachers and classmates about main issues of society. Nowadays most employers of companies put importance on candidates' real working ability such as socializing and discussion skills when they choose their workers. Thus students who have high level of debating can be competitive in job market.I would explain how my reason could be supported. When teachers express their opinion about social and political events in the class, some student can have different view. Â In that situation, teacher can divide the class into two groups, and two groups debate over the teacher's view. For the discussion, teacher would prepare well and help progression of it. Thus, students are able to learn how to make points against others though debating experience. As seen above, the discussion regarding social and political event with teachers and friends who express their perspectives will give great opportunity to improve their discussing skill to students. <br><br>As mentioned above regarding the topic, I think that it is desirable to show their perspective about social or political issues in class for the following reasons. Firstly, student can get balanced comprehension as to social or political issue through that teachers show their opinion with many authors' views. Â Moreover, student can be grow up their debating ability through discussion about social issue with teacher.""":::

It is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times.":::"""Some people prefer to change jobs several times rather than to work at the same company for a long time. Because people who change jobs many time can get more variety experience. However, I think that it is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times. There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that you can move up the company ladder. The other reason is that you can develop strong relationship with your companion.<br><br>First of all, I believe that if you stay with a company for several years, you have the opportunity to be promoted more quickly. This is an excellent boost for one's career since with every promotion you are learning something new about the company and you can get respect from your coworkers. And this experience can help you to advance in high rank. In addition, if you transfer to other department or other company, you can bring the knowledge learned from the process of promotion.<br><br>Second, staying with one job over a long period of time offers you the opportunity to developing strong relationship with your companion. Sometimes, we can communicate or eat lunch with companion rather than our family because we spend a lot of time on working in the company. Then you can have a chance to share your living life or idea about the business with your coworker. It can make that you feel a sense of fellowship. And since you have built strong bonds with others, it may also put you in a unique position to help your coworkers. You can give your companion better advices to solve the problem because you usually have a lot of talking time with your coworkers.<br><br>In conclusion, working at the same company for a long time give you the opportunity to be promoted more quickly and also offer the opportunity to developing strong bonds with your coworkers. For these reasons, I feel that it is better to stay with one job for a long time.""":::

Universities and high schools should teach students about specific careers and fields instead of general subjects.":::"""Some people say that it is better to study general subjects than specific careers. However, generally speaking, I believe that universities and high schools should teach students about specific careers in place of general subjects.<br><br>To begin with, studying specific fields helps the students get jobs much easier. Since the students studied some special careers, they are more likely to know what they want to become or where they want to work. Also, they are more professional. For example, according to a study conducted by Seoul National University in Korea, ten people of Group A which majored in a certain career, was much faster at getting jobs than ten people of Group B who studied a broader and a more general career. Group B was having a hard time figuring out special fields that they were good at. This clearly shows that it is more convenient to learn a more detailed topic than a general one. <br><br>In addition, it boosts the interest of students in studying. There are many students who are not interested in studying, simply because they do not find it interesting for them. Studying specifically about certain topics will help them to find their talents or interests. For example, I can recall that when I took art class, the teacher offered to teach me more about painting after school. I thought I was not very good at art, but as she taught me more detailed and harder techniques, I found out that I love arts. This made me realize that it is very important to know well what you are studying in order to fully grasp your ability. I would be the first one to admit that learning general subjects helps students find what they are interested in. However, it does not provide an environment where students can focus on one subject. Therefore, I think that studying more detailed subjects encourage students to know what they really enjoy learning.<br><br>As a way of conclusion, based on the arguments explained above, I am of the opinion that as schools should prepare students for their future in a bigger society, it is much more beneficial for them to teach about detailed subjects than general topics.<br><br>""":::

""Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.""":::"""There is an argument over whether Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own. I disagree that individual people can't do anything about environmental issues for two reasons. First, the reason of global warming which is the biggest environmental problem is carbon emissions from cars. Second, individual people can have a great impact on environmental issues through the Internet. <br><br>First, carbon emissions from cars have a negative effect on environment. Some people might say that only government can solve the environmental problems since it is too complex. However, let me show an example to prove why individual people can help to solve the environmental issues. Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world. Floods and landslides took the lives of countless people as well as placing affected areas at health risk. European nations were no exception. Many areas there were flooded or suffered wildfire. Sadly, it was extremely costly to ensure that all victims were able to put their lives back together. Carbon emissions from cars and other human activities are largely responsible for global warming. Various measures are being taken by governments to handle this problem. Efforts to develop better technology for solar and wind energy are gaining momentum. Â Governments ask people to use subways and buses on their way to home and work rather than driving their own cars. Driving less and using public transportations can be done by people's individual efforts. This shows that individual people can help to solve environmental problems by driving less and using public transportation. <br><br>Second, environmental issues can be affected by individual people thanks to Internet. For example, my house is located near the industrial area. One day, I found that some factories in that area emit harmful chemicals to the river. So I put a post on electronic bulletin in the government website. Because of my report, factories should fine a lot of money and the environmental regulations in that area are strengthened. This proves that individual efforts through the internet can help to improve environmental situation. <br><br>In conclusion, I disagree that individual people can't do anything about environmental issues for the reasons I have mentioned above.

Â Opinions are divided over the taking information from various sources is needed to people in order to be well informed. I do not agree with this statement for two reasons. Â Firstly, different view of many sources is confusing. Moreover, I think getting information from various news sources keep people from deep understanding.<br><br>More than anything else, people would be confused when they get information from a lot of news sources, because each media has different opinion about one fact. Thus people cannot be in well informed. This reminds me of the time when I traveled to some countries of Africa in college years. While there, I was highly shocked by the large number of people who were suffering from starvation and AIDS. Â Naturally I become to have interest about problem of poverty in Africa countries. So, when I came back to the Korea, I searched information about those countries that I visited from many websites. I read lots of articles, however, each of them has different contents. Some sources said that countries' government in Africa does not spend their money improving quality of people's lives. In contrast, other news said that their government cannot afford to support their nation, and serious poverty is caused by not enough aid from advanced countries. Therefore, after I saw these sources, I could not know the real truth and confused due to the totally different information. As my experience shows, the information from various materials makes people to be confused.<br><br>In addition, I think it is impossible to have deep understanding without enough time for one source. Let me explain my case that can support my claim. When I was in high school, I had to submit report about global warming in the class. I was eagerly in that class, so thought that getting lots of information is best way to know the issue. Thus, I tried to find information as many as possible both in library and in video posted in the Internet. However, it was impossible for me to fully understand all detail of my all collected sources because of enormous quantity of information. Thus, teacher of that class gave me a comment that I have a just superficial knowledge, and suggested me to read just one thesis many times than to glance many articles to stay in well informed. In this sense, we can definitely notice that if we obtain information from many new sources, we cannot totally understand all of it. <br><br>As mentioned above regarding the issue, I think people are not able to stay well informed when they get information from many news media for following reasons. First reason is that people are confused by different information from variety of news sources. Furthermore, lots of news materials prevent people from fully understanding of exact fact.

People can take part in activities like taking public transport instead of their own car and recycling.<br><br>First of all, people can help improve the environment to get better by starting to take small actions like using public transport rather than one's own cars. This is due to the fact that taking public transport helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide produced which is harmful to the environment. To be specific, there was a research done by Seoul National University, that they measured the amount of carbon dioxide produced by adding the numbers of cars and see the difference. They found out that there was a quite a big gap between a car producing and when another was added in the area. This shows that when a single individual tries to take public transport instead of his own car, it will greatly affect the environment.<br><br>In addition, recycling helps to cut down the amount of natural materials used to make products. This is attributed to the fact that by recycling, no new materials are needed to make a new product. Trees, for example, are used to make papers. However, if old papers are recycled to make new ones, there will be less trees cut down to produce papers. This means that the more recycling done by individuals, the lesser trees being cut down.

I could not be more surprised, but it was the power of TV.<br><br>There is no opposition that TV influences people greatly in many ways. When there are positive effects, there are always negative effects. TV used in purpose in education is a positive side of the influence. However, if it is used to entertain people, it will influence people in many negative ways. To be specific,":::

What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.":::"As more and more people are seeking after a job where it offers a fine salary, people begin to realize that having a good supervisor is another important fact when considering for a job. In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. However, I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.<br><br>For starters, good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees promote faster and that is what they do in their position at work. In addition, this not only make the employees enhance their positions but paves the way to make company a better reputation by having good leaders. For example, my older sister, who finished graduate school, got a job where it gives enough salary. Afterwards, my sister had a supervisor who had a very strong leadership. Since the boss led my sister very well with good judgement and nice advices, she promoted much faster than her friends from graduate school. This implies that strong leadership is a very important characteristic of a good supervisor.<br><br>Secondly, friendly leader is probably what the all employees are wishful to have at their work place. This is because most of the workers from all over the world suffer from stresses at work because of high pressure from boss or because of unfriendly environment.However, if a leader is very friendly, that will create much comfortable atmosphere where all of the employees can work with such enjoyment and that will eventually lead to a long term work. To be more detailed, there was a survey among the workers from renowned company about the reason why they work in the long term. Not surprisingly, about half of them answered because of the high name value of the company, but other half of them responded that it is because of good leaders who are very friendly. This definitely implies the important quality of a good supervisor is a amiable personality.<br><br>On the whole, even though the jury is still out, I firmly believe that having a good leadership and friendly personality is the most significant traits among others because of faster promotion and enjoyable atmosphere at work.":::

What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.":::"""Many people have a tendency to watch sports game on TV. There are many people watch them, although they are televised at late night. In addition, people who do not watch them last night used to check the result of game in the morning through the Internet and newspaper, not to mentioned news. It is a good material to have a conversation with others in school and workplace. In this sense, playing sports has an influence on our daily life and I think that it is helpful to improve the quality of our life owing to a character that includes some important lessons.<br><br>First of all, people can learn various skills that are useful for them to adapt to their life. Because of the fact that human beings are social animal, if they are isolated from their society, they would feel stressed and turn bad or violent, not communicating with others. For this reason, it is very important for them to live in their society. By playing sports, we can get a cooperation skill and social skill that are essential for us. Playing sports is not a survival game, but one of the methods of conversation that makes it possible for them to understand each other.<br><br>Secondly, the advantage of playing sports games is that we can learn sportsmanship, which is called the spirit of fair play. Today, a huge number of games are held, with fixed rules demanded. Soccer game is a very popular game all over the world. However, it sometimes causes terrible accidents that take place in playing field. It is not right. Not only is it an illegal behavior, but also it deserves to be criticized. The most important thing is not the result of the game, not player's attitude. Players have to respect other players, do their best and play fairly.<br><br>In conclusion, as I just mentioned above, playing sports games provides people with valuable lessons about their life.""":::

You have received a gift of money. The money is enough to buy either a piece of jewelry you like or tickets to a concert you want to attend. Which would you buy?":::"""Some people may think that purchasing jewelry would better than attending a concert. The jewelry could be valuable in realistic. However, I strongly recommend visiting the concert instead of buying a piece of jewelry for two points.<br><br>First point is that people hardly need worrying about losing memories. A piece of jewelry would make people worry about losing it. Because of these worries, people can suffer from their mental stress. On the other hand, the memory is not going anywhere. Moreover, the impression that people could get from the concert would makes people happy. With the help of the concert, people could refreshed and concentrate in their work much better by relieving stress form daily life. For example, when people get a lottery, they might be happy at first. However, there is a chance that it could be stolen or lost. So that people could not help worrying. On the other hand, if I attend exciting concert, I could recharge myself and get rid of stress. With this aspect, the memory of concert allows me pay attention to my work better.<br><br>The other point is that people can find their new interest by attending concert. When people attend the concert, the singer's feather could be one of attractive things. Thus, it can promote people's interest naturally. In contrast, a piece of jewelry hardly promotes people's interest. The impression that people get from it is only beautiful or pretty. For instance, my favorite singer played the guitar at his concert one year ago. I was so impressed that I started to practice playing the guitar after the concert. Nowadays, playing a guitar becomes one of my hobbies. For this reason, attending concert could let me find my interest.<br><br>To sum up, I firmly recommend that people should attend the concert rather than make a purchase of a piece of jewelry. Even thought it could be a valuable, I can get stressed by worrying about losing it. In contrast, I can get helpful memory and find another interest by attending a concert.<br><br>""":::

The ability to read and write is more important today than in the past. Do you agree or disagree?":::"""A lot of controversy exists over whether the literacy ability is more significant nowadays than in the past. Some might disagree with the given statement because the advent and development of literacy was greatly improved in the past than today. Personally, however, I firmly think that reading and writing skill becomes increasingly more Â important these days for several reasons. First of all, the employment competition is boosted now. Not only that, but people usually use the Internet in their daily routines. The following statements will support the opinion.<br><br>More than anything else, people are more competitive than before because it is difficult to find the job. In modern society, people are likely to work at the company rather than just doing agriculture living in hometown like in the past. Thus, they have to put much effort on improving their reading and writing capability to get into preferred workplace. As a result, the ability to read and write plays more crucial role in improving people's life. According to a study recently released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two thirds of CEOs of the corporations responded that they regard reading and wrting skill importantly because it is necessary in working.Based on the research, they insisted that second-language is also important in global world. As this example demonstrates, it is no doubt that the literacy competitiveness is much more important than before.<br><br>Besides, the technological development leads people to boost reading and writing skill. Obviously, it is true that some people still enjoy off-line lives. However, current trend is using internet at shopping, doing assignments and communicating with others. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the literacy capability is required to modern people to use the Internet which is based on reading and writing. To illustrate, one of my friends Jessica is works on the net, not commuting to and from the work. Also, she shop around the Internet shopping malls with easy access to computer. Furthermore, she communicate with her parents who lived far away by e-mail. Without the literacy talent, she would not be able to live conveniently and effectively. In this sense, people these days should have the talents on reading and writing due to the development of technology.<br><br>As I have argued, I strongly believe that the capability of reading and writing is more importnat than before. This is due to the fact that competitive society and technological development. Given this, it is quite obvious that modern people need the skill how to read and write than in the past.""":::

""Today, life is easier and cozier than it was when our grandparents were young. Do you agree or disagree?""":::"""Some people may argue that the generation of our grandparents was much easier and more comfortable to live. However, for the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8000 years, there have been significant changes. Adam and Eve became seven people population of people. Along with the growth in the number of population, growth in technology and income has blossomed as well. Therefore, I strongly believe that life in my period of time has much better condition than the generation of grandparents'.<br><br>Modern society has created a number of inventions that people only dreamed of in the past. People in the past had to do the laundries with their bare hands, spend time to wash their dishes, walk or ride horses to get to the destination, and sleep on the hard ground. Yet, those are the conditions that the people in nowadays cannot even imagine living in. There are washing machines that do our laundries, dish washers that brighten our dishes, cars and airplanes that allow us to travel around the world within a day, and beds that provide comfortable environment for us to have sweet dreams. Nevertheless, there is an even better invention that distinguishes our lives from those of grandparents'; the Internet. It has made our lives prosperous and easy. Thanks to the Internet, we can now shop clothes, furniture, and even groceries online. No one is required to leave their houses to purchase. Moreover, the Internet contains not only the shopping mall, but also the entertainment. It provides us with great games, movies, and dramas. Basically, everything that required labor force in the past is now possible without it due to the help of the Internet.<br><br>The internet and other developments have done a lot to enhance my generation's living condition, but economic growth has done tremendous job to enrich the living environment. For example, my grandfather is a war veteran who fought in Korean War. The growth domestic product per person back then was less than a dollar, whereas the current GDP per person in Korea is over 20,000 dollars. With this great advancement in economic growth, people can now afford products such as cars, cozy houses, and clothes.<br><br>I feel grateful for my grandparents and the ancestors beyond them for letting me enjoy the abundance of this generation. Even though nothing lets me to live an immortal live, it is evident that remarkable development in technology and extensive growth in income permit my generation to live in better quality of lives than that of grandparents'. Therefore, I am strongly against the statement that our grandparents had better quality of live than our generation.""":::

""Which do you prefer working alone or working with a team?

""":::"""Co-working and collaboration are hot issues today. The society is more complex than before which means that there is no definitive answer for problem solving in these days. Thus, we need to listen carefully and to understand deeply the other's voices. It looks like that takes more time and more effort compared to single persons' problem strategies. However, this is right approach, if we consider future risks.<br><br>Collective Intelligence contains diverse aspects. As mentioned previous paragraph, there are lots of stakeholders even in single and small events today. Thus, these different voices might be future risks. So far, in the process of the problem solving and gathering ideas, we need a time for listening from various opinions from various stakeholders. Let's assume the road construction project, if local government do this project by top-down approach, this would make severe problems between local residents and users; If local government does not consider 'noisy', 'natural resources', and 'congestion', local people might make some protest for that. So far, construction period will be delayed or even possibly canceled. Thus, working together and listening the diverse voices are short-cuts to make effective accomplishment.<br><br>Secondly, one plus one is more than two. This sentence looks too common. However, it contains lots of meaning. Let's assume the participatory discussion and debate in company; brain storming and mind-mapping are good examples. Through these kinds of events, the participants easily get the other's ideas and develop their idea by assistance from the others. In other words, we can find positive-leverage effects by working together. Definition of knowledge, which has been changed, is more worthy in case of spreading out to the others.<br><br>Sum up, everyone knows that to think alone and do alone is faster than working together. I firmly believe that it is not right approach. I repeatedly said that we need to consider more diverse aspects and various voices. Today, leader is not only one person. Meaning of leader is changed as like facilitator. Therefore, team members work together and think together to find a right solution; this is more proper approach in complex society.<br><br>""":::

""The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.

""":::"""Some people say that it is important to cooperate with others well today than in the past. However, on the other hand, I think that it is more important in the past than now to cooperate with people for the following reasons : people were not able to make up their living if they do not cooperate and because they have neighbours very close to them, it was important to cooperate. <br><br>First of all, it was important to cooperate with others to help out each other when they need some help. This is due to the fact that people had to make all things by themselves at that time and those works required a lot of labor sometimes like when you are building a house or planting rice. It was not easy for them to do those things by themselves as it took lots of time and effort. To be specific, there was a research done by Seoul National University showing comparison between the past and now how things got simpler and easier by the technology development. They found out that almost all works could be done with all sorts of machines. There was hardly a thing that could not be done. People now do not have to depend on somebody else to help them with any kinds of work and therefore the importance of cooperating with others is weaken.<br><br>In addition, it was important to cooperate and keep a good relationship with neighbours in the past. This is attributed to the fact that people usually lived in a village, their houses side by side. Because they see each other very often and people at that time did not move their homes easily, it was common for people to live with their neighbours next to them for entire life. To be specific, if they had not keep a good relationship, they would have lived a stressful life because they see one another as many times as they see their family members. Unlike in the past, now many people live in an apartment building, only have a few neighbours in each floor and they hardly see each other as they are busy with their own lives. There was a survey done by some apartments asking how many times they see their neighbours and how close they are with them. The result was that there were people even did not know who lived next door and they were not usually close with them, just showing basic curtesy by simple greetings. This implies that because people in the past lived their lives with their neighbours close, it would have been important to cooperate with them in order to live happy lives.<br><br>In brief, although the ability to cooperate is important now, there were more needs of this ability in the past to make up their living easy and to live happy lives with the neighbours living next door.<br><br>""":::

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.":::"""Games have positive effect not only on children but also on adults. Sometimes violent computer games make people aggressive and commit some illegal affairs. However, games are not a petty or frivolous thing even to adults.<br><br>First, adults can get along with others and relieve stress as children do so. When using the word, âgame,' we use âplay' as a verb. âPlaying' is the human natural behavior and all of us naturally learn how to play by ourselves. By playing games, people form social relationship with friends, teachers, and their families. It is not merely example for children. Especially, when adults get stressed out from their working places or relationships with others, they can relieve stress by playing games such as basketball or baseball games. In my case, I usually play computer games with my friends when I get stressed out from study. It makes me forget some bad things temporarily and gives a chance to get along with my friends.<br><br>Secondly, adults can feel a sense of achievement when they win the game. Most games have the competitive characteristic. Games have certain rules, and players should follow and obey these rules in order to win the game. From the start of a game, people begin the game with the same condition. However, when proceeding the game, they meet difficulties and they may have competitive spirit to defeat someone else. Under fair rules, people lies on the competition in good faith. This good competitive spirit has a positive effect on their life and outside of the game as well. In the end of the game, we can feel joyful emotions and it stimulates our motivation more synergetic when we win others or get a higher score in a game.<br><br>In conclusion, the positive effects of games are not limited only to children. Adults should have some free time when they get stressed out. Playing games can be a prescription for today's lethargic adults.""":::

It is not desirable for teachers to express their view on social or political issues views in class. Do you agree or disagree?":::"""Nowadays role of teachers has tremendous importance in our lives. Opinions are divided over this statement that showing view political and social issues in class is not good for teacher. I do not agree with this statement for two reasons. First, teacher can help student to understand well about social or political issues by showing their opinions with many media sources' view. Secondly, student can be competitive.<br><br>More than anything else, I think teacher only can help student to understand social and political issues. Â Teachers' main role is to convey knowledge to students, so they are able to mention well-balanced view by integrating their own thinking and other authors' view about social and political. Therefore it will be helpful for student to have opportunity to be well informed about current society's issues. Let me suggest example that can support my claim. I had a chance to travel to Africa continent few years ago. I was highly shocked that numerous people were suffering from starvation and AIDS. Even many children were in malnourished and had little or no access to education. I could not comprehend why these innocent people had to live in such detrimental conditions. So I sought out various sources about it on the Internet to learn more about as to the issues. There were conflicting views opinions in articles. Some news blamed first world countries for not providing enough aid to impoverish countries. Other pointed the finger at the civil wars among ethnic group in African continent. Thus, I could not understand which view is right. Â Some days after, history teacher expressed his opinion regarding this issue, and suggested other experts â perspectives in class. As a result, I was able to better understand the situation in a balanced view. As my experience shows, teacher can help student to comprehend current issue well. <br><br>In addition, students are able to enhance their debating skills through discussion with teachers and classmates about main issues of society. Nowadays most employers of companies put importance on candidates' real working ability such as socializing and discussion skills when they choose their workers. Thus students who have high level of debating can be competitive in job market.I would explain how my reason could be supported. When teachers express their opinion about social and political events in the class, some student can have different view. Â In that situation, teacher can divide the class into two groups, and two groups debate over the teacher's view. For the discussion, teacher would prepare well and help progression of it. Thus, students are able to learn how to make points against others though debating experience. As seen above, the discussion regarding social and political event with teachers and friends who express their perspectives will give great opportunity to improve their discussing skill to students. <br><br>As mentioned above regarding the topic, I think that it is desirable to show their perspective about social or political issues in class for the following reasons. Firstly, student can get balanced comprehension as to social or political issue through that teachers show their opinion with many authors' views. Â Moreover, student can be grow up their debating ability through discussion about social issue with teacher.""":::

It is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times.":::"""Some people prefer to change jobs several times rather than to work at the same company for a long time. Because people who change jobs many time can get more variety experience. However, I think that it is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times. There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that you can move up the company ladder. The other reason is that you can develop strong relationship with your companion.<br><br>First of all, I believe that if you stay with a company for several years, you have the opportunity to be promoted more quickly. This is an excellent boost for one's career since with every promotion you are learning something new about the company and you can get respect from your coworkers. And this experience can help you to advance in high rank. In addition, if you transfer to other department or other company, you can bring the knowledge learned from the process of promotion.<br><br>Second, staying with one job over a long period of time offers you the opportunity to developing strong relationship with your companion. Sometimes, we can communicate or eat lunch with companion rather than our family because we spend a lot of time on working in the company. Then you can have a chance to share your living life or idea about the business with your coworker. It can make that you feel a sense of fellowship. And since you have built strong bonds with others, it may also put you in a unique position to help your coworkers. You can give your companion better advices to solve the problem because you usually have a lot of talking time with your coworkers.<br><br>In conclusion, working at the same company for a long time give you the opportunity to be promoted more quickly and also offer the opportunity to developing strong bonds with your coworkers. For these reasons, I feel that it is better to stay with one job for a long time.""":::

Universities and high schools should teach students about specific careers and fields instead of general subjects.":::"""Some people say that it is better to study general subjects than specific careers. However, generally speaking, I believe that universities and high schools should teach students about specific careers in place of general subjects.<br><br>To begin with, studying specific fields helps the students get jobs much easier. Since the students studied some special careers, they are more likely to know what they want to become or where they want to work. Also, they are more professional. For example, according to a study conducted by Seoul National University in Korea, ten people of Group A which majored in a certain career, was much faster at getting jobs than ten people of Group B who studied a broader and a more general career. Group B was having a hard time figuring out special fields that they were good at. This clearly shows that it is more convenient to learn a more detailed topic than a general one. <br><br>In addition, it boosts the interest of students in studying. There are many students who are not interested in studying, simply because they do not find it interesting for them. Studying specifically about certain topics will help them to find their talents or interests. For example, I can recall that when I took art class, the teacher offered to teach me more about painting after school. I thought I was not very good at art, but as she taught me more detailed and harder techniques, I found out that I love arts. This made me realize that it is very important to know well what you are studying in order to fully grasp your ability. I would be the first one to admit that learning general subjects helps students find what they are interested in. However, it does not provide an environment where students can focus on one subject. Therefore, I think that studying more detailed subjects encourage students to know what they really enjoy learning.<br><br>As a way of conclusion, based on the arguments explained above, I am of the opinion that as schools should prepare students for their future in a bigger society, it is much more beneficial for them to teach about detailed subjects than general topics.<br><br>""":::

""Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.""":::"""There is an argument over whether Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own. I disagree that individual people can't do anything about environmental issues for two reasons. First, the reason of global warming which is the biggest environmental problem is carbon emissions from cars. Second, individual people can have a great impact on environmental issues through the Internet. <br><br>First, carbon emissions from cars have a negative effect on environment. Some people might say that only government can solve the environmental problems since it is too complex. However, let me show an example to prove why individual people can help to solve the environmental issues. Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world. Floods and landslides took the lives of countless people as well as placing affected areas at health risk. European nations were no exception. Many areas there were flooded or suffered wildfire. Sadly, it was extremely costly to ensure that all victims were able to put their lives back together. Carbon emissions from cars and other human activities are largely responsible for global warming. Various measures are being taken by governments to handle this problem. Efforts to develop better technology for solar and wind energy are gaining momentum. Â Governments ask people to use subways and buses on their way to home and work rather than driving their own cars. Driving less and using public transportations can be done by people's individual efforts. This shows that individual people can help to solve environmental problems by driving less and using public transportation. <br><br>Second, environmental issues can be affected by individual people thanks to Internet. For example, my house is located near the industrial area. One day, I found that some factories in that area emit harmful chemicals to the river.

So, when I came back to the Korea, I searched information about those countries that I visited from many websites. I read lots of articles, however, each of them has different contents. Some sources said that countries' government in Africa does not spend their money improving quality of people's lives. In contrast, other news said that their government cannot afford to support their nation, and serious poverty is caused by not enough aid from advanced countries. Therefore, after I saw these sources, I could not know the real truth and confused due to the totally different information. As my experience shows, the information from various materials makes people to be confused.<br><br>In addition, I think it is impossible to have deep understanding without enough time for one source.

Thus, I tried to find information as many as possible both in library and in video posted in the Internet. However, it was impossible for me to fully understand all detail of my all collected sources because of enormous quantity of information. Thus, teacher of that class gave me a comment that I have a just superficial knowledge, and suggested me to read just one thesis many times than to glance many articles to stay in well informed. In this sense, we can definitely notice that if we obtain information from many new sources, we cannot totally understand all of it. <br><br>As mentioned above regarding the issue, I think people are not able to stay well informed when they get information from many news media for following reasons. First reason is that people are confused by different information from variety of news sources. Furthermore, lots of news materials prevent people from fully understanding of exact fact.
