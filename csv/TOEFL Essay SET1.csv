However, I think that when we <del>should </del>communicate <ins>with </ins>others, other than face to face communication, other types of communications are better for some reasons below.<br><br>First, through <del>the </del>types of communication such as email, telephone, or <del>on </del>the Internet, people save <del>their </del>money to some extent.

There are several reasons to support <del> </del>my argument so I will limit to the two that I feel are the most <mod target = relevant>related</mod> to the topic. First, <del> </del>exercising is a more effective way for people to relieve their stress. Also, by exercising, people <del> </del>can <mod target = develop>make</mod> deep relationship<ins>s</ins> with their friends.<br><br>To begin with, people can feel <mod target = more relaxed>better relaxation</mod> after doing physical activities than just reading a book <mod target = at>in a</mod> home. This is due to the fact that exercising distracts people from worries and stress. This simple and quick escape from the reality can serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. On the other hand, reading a book can stress people due to its complex and profound contents. According to a study conducted by the department of education of Seoul National University of Korea in 2007, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing academic pressure. Students in Group A exercised regularly and cooperated with each other <mod target = in>with</mod> playing sports but those in Group B rarely engaged in such activities and just read <del>a </del>book<ins>s</ins> in their rooms. The researcher found that the former group were more satisfied with their school lives than the latter group. Moreover, students in Group B were involved in dangerous activities such as drinking and smoking to cope with their stress. This implies that exercising is a more <mod target = effective>appropriate</mod> way to relax.<br><br>Also, by playing sports, people can <mod target = develop>make</mod> better relationship<ins>s</ins> which help people to relax themselves. This is attributed to the fact that while doing physical exercises, people cooperate with their friends and <mod target = communicate more with>make more communication</mod> each other. It is very imperative because modern society is <del>increasingly </del>becoming <ins>increasingly </ins>competitive. Therefore, with such relationship<ins>s</ins>, they can feel more relaxation and consolation, which cannot be made by just reading a book. This reminds me of my story. When I was a high school student, I felt lots of stress and was nervous due to <mod target = a>the</mod> lack of relationship<ins>s</ins> with my friends. Thus, I tried to exercise<del>d</del> every day in order to forget about it. When I played a basketball alone, some friends asked me to play together.

This example showed that doing physical activities is a secure way to have good relationship<ins>s</ins>.<br><br>To sum<ins> up</ins>, although some people like reading <del>a </del>book<ins>s</ins> or watching <del>a </del>movie<ins>s</ins> in order to relax, the <del> </del>advantages of playing sports cannot be underestimated for the aforementioned reasons.

55&Television destroy communication among friends and family. Do you agree?":::"There is an argument concerning whether television destroy<ins>s</ins> communication among friends and family. In fact, it is true that television takes <ins>away </ins>people's time to<del> </del> communicate <ins>with </ins>each other. But it doesn't mean a television disturbs communication among family or friend<ins>s</ins>. I think television helps communications between <mod target = people>one's and other's</mod>. I will briefly explain some reasons for this in this essay.<br><br>First of all, a television can creates many communication topics. <mod target = For example>To explain</mod>, a few years ago there was a very popular audition program named Superstar K. <mod target = on>in</mod> every Friday night. After this program, there <mod target = were>are</mod> many opinion<del>'</del>s about the program. Some friends who didn't watch the program couldn't participate in <mod target = the conversations about it>talk</mod>. Also, <mod target = among>in</mod> family members, we can talk <ins>about </ins>lots of things with our parents. Generally, <mod target = most children don't>almost son and daughter doesn't</mod> have common <mod target = conversation>communication</mod> topic<ins>s</ins> with their parents. However, a television can provide <del>a common </del>topic<ins>s</ins> such as teenage<del>r</del> crime<ins>s,</ins> <del>or </del>game addiction<ins>,</ins> or many <ins>other </ins>things. Through this, people can communicate with their parents, so <del>a </del>relationship<ins>s</ins> between people and their parent<ins>s</ins> can get better. In this sense, television can help <del>to </del>communication.<br><br>Secondly, television can develop <del>a </del>relationship<ins>s</ins> among people. For example, many students like sports such as soccer. These students often watch soccer game<ins>s</ins> <mod target = on>through</mod> a television <mod target = at>in</mod> their school. From <mod target = this>these act</mod>, their friendship<ins>s</ins> can be developed. In addition, a television can gather a family. In modern society many people are very busy. Since they are really busy, they don't have time to meet their family. But some entertainment television programs can gather some families. Consequently, some television programs help family gathering and communication<del>s</del>. Thus watching television is good <mod target = for>at</mod> communication with family members.<br><br>In summary, I disagree with the statement that television can destroy a family or friend's communication on account of some reasons I mentioned above: not only does the topic<ins>-</ins><del> </del>providing function that a television has, but it also help<ins>s</ins> <del>to </del>develop <mod target = relationships with family and friends>about family member's or friend's relationship</mod>.<br><br>":::

""56&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers.

""":::"It is common<ins>ly</ins> said in Korea that children follow their parents. Like this, parents are the most important factor in children's lives and some people say that the best teacher<ins>s</ins> for <mod target = children are their parents>childres is parent</mod>.

Thus <mod target = watching>seeing</mod> their parents<ins>,</ins> children learn many things like speaking well, preparing <del>a </del>meal<ins>s</ins>, housing skills, and <mod target = loving people>loves</mod>. To be more specific, parents try to <mod target = spend as much time with them as possible when they are young, and even after doing other things like spending time with friends, they usually go back to spending time with their parents>keep in touch with them as much as possible when they are young and after being able to do something like play with their friends, children usually stay with their parents lots of time</mod>. This is significantly important since that time is much longer than <ins>the time they spend </ins>with <mod target = anyone else>any other</mod> such as <del>a </del>school teacher<ins>s</ins> and they do the best themselves teach well. Therefore although school teacher<ins>s</ins> have <del>a </del>adequate teaching skill<ins>s</ins> for <del>children's </del>certain age<ins>s</ins>, it is indispensible that parents have more <mod target = effect>affect</mod> on children's <mod target = lives>life</mod> and become the best teacher<ins>s</ins>.<br><br>Secondly, there is no <mod target = one who knows the children better>person who know well children</mod> than their parents. Since <mod target = they've>having</mod> seen their children <mod target = since>when</mod> they <mod target = were babies>are babe</mod>, parents have huge amount<ins>s</ins> of <mod target = knowledge>knowldege</mod> about them. They are able to suitably teach children according their abilities and styles, which is almost impossible for school teacher<ins>s,</ins> having to be fair with many children. For example, there are various children and they have different aptitude<ins>s</ins> respectively. Some do well <del>in </del>playing soccer, some like <mod target = reading books>reaing a book</mod>, while others are very <mod target = strong>stong</mod>. In this situation, it is difficult for teacher<ins>s</ins> to do proper activities <mod target = to develop>for developing</mod> their strength. Thus, parents are needed and they can be considered more advanced teach<ins>ers</ins> for their children than school teacher<ins>s</ins> <mod target = who have>having a</mod> professional teaching skill.<br><br>To summarize, there is no <mod target = one>persons</mod> better than parents. As discussed above, that is because children take their time with their parents and parents know <mod target = their>thier</mod> children <mod target = better>well more</mod> than <mod target = anyone else>any other</mod>.":::

58&Advice from older people is more valuable than from peers.":::"The issue of whether advice from older people is more valuable than from peers has been subject to continuous debate. Some people have argued in favor of this position while others have expressed their concerns. Although each argument and the reasons in support of their claim<ins>s</ins> have its advantages and disadvantages, I am of the position that advice from old people is not <ins>more</ins> important than <ins>advice </ins>from peers based on the following two reasons<mod target = :>.</mod> First, friends can give more useful advice,<del> </del> and second,<del>  </del><mod target = spent>people spend</mod> lots of time with their friends.  I will illustrate these reasons in more detail.<br><br>To start with, we can get more practical advice from<ins> peers</ins>. In other words, friends can <mod target = five>give</mod> actual advice without <ins>being </ins>biased. For example, when I was in college, I had some problem<ins>s</ins> about <mod target = graduate>graduation</mod>. I ask<ins>ed</ins> <del>to </del>my friend. Therefore, I <mod target = can>was able</mod> solve my problem without any problem. Furthermore, one of the best guy Jackson mentioned the best way to solve the problem is advice form peers. In fact, if we consider about advice from old people. However, generally speaking, the advantages of my position far outweigh the possible benefits of the counter claim. According to a recent survey conducted by psychology research team at Columbia University, vast majority of the respondents claimed that people should get some advice for their life from their peers. Furthermore many showed concerns for the counter claim because it is important for our life. Therefore, these results clearly support my position.<br><br>On top of that, friends significantly influence young adults because of the amount of time they spend together. As young adults become older, they spend less time with their parents and more with their friends in school. Especially their friends staying out or hanging out together. For example, when I was a senior in high school, I had spent almost half a day in school preparing for the college entrance exam. Since I did not have much chance to talk to my family, I consulted with my friends whenever I had the problem and listened to their advice. This was because  I thought they understood me better than my parents did as we spent time together.<br><br>As I have stated above, both arguments have positive and negative implications. However, because friends can give more useful advice and spend lots of time with their friends, I personally agree with the statement that advice from older people is not important than from peers. However, in the end, I would recommend you to make the choice that fits you the best.":::

59&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Citizens should not have to pay public transportation fees.

However in my opinion, citizens should be able to ride public transportation free of charge because it will reduce <del>the </del>traffic and give economic benefits to families.<br><br>To begin with, providing free public transportation would result in less <mod target = traffic>trafic</mod> on the roads. This is because more people would choose bus<ins>es</ins> or the subway rather than <mod target = driving>drive</mod>, as driving would then be much more expensive. Studies have shown that free transit has been successful in cities that have implemented it. In one case, public transit use increased by over 15 percent, while the percentage of cars on the road decreased by nearly the same amount.

In other words, hard working does not guarantee the better chance, and rather, it might lose the insight about things. In Korea, many students who just graduated their college tend to set their goal as entering large companies, where welfare system are good enough and they can paid much comparing to somewhat small companies. They just keep hard working for making money, but they are losing their sight, with their ages getting old, which makes them still water in the end.<br><br>In conclusion, hard working, never giving up, without serious consideration about their aptitude and for new things do not mean real success in ones' life.

In this essay, I will present two reasons to support my idea.<br><br>            To begin with, music and art classes can help children enjoy considerably fertile lives when they are grown up.

In addition, people who have received art or music <mod target = education>class</mod> are able to express their emotions and feelings in <del>a </del>more various and effective way<ins>s</ins>.

However, in my opinion, <ins>the </ins>government should continue <mod target = with>to</mod> support for scientific research for the following reasons : for one's country to get ready for the future and it has potential power needed.<br><br>First of all, how much scientific research done properly may determine the power of the country. This is due to the fact that countries are competing with these scientific knowledge and information as the technology now has developed alot and there are only a few ways to show their power. All countries in the world live in similar environments, enable people to live in a standard conditions these days. Therefore there is only a few ways to make difference, to make science field stronger. It is a duty for the country to decide whether to develop and improve the scientific research. To be specific, if there is a spread of a kind of disease that the medicine for cure has not been made. A country can be powerful if there is a vaccine or medicine made for the disease and this kind of work can be done when scientific research is done continuously. In this world today, variety of happenings can occur as the technology has developed too fast in a short while. This implies that the scientific research should be supported. <br><br>In addtion, there is potential power in scientific research. However, because the effect of the research done does not show right away, people tend to think that it is useless. Scientific research cannot be done at once, it surely takes long time to focus on a subject, carry out experiments over and over again to make sure there is no faculty and analyzing the result of the research. But science is all related to different kinds of studies, works and daily lives. Research can be done in variety of fields, improving one's quality. For example, there can be a research done in making machines. Then, later when the research is carried out and finally come up with a result, there can be all sorts of ways to make machines work better or maybe new machines could be created to make people's lives better by doing less work as works are done by those machines. If the scientific research is not supported by the government, it would be hard for researchers to work on the projects to make better environment for living for people in the country. <br><br>In brief, although scientific research has no direct effect and has practical purpose, it should be supported to get ready for the future and to be prepared for now.<br><br>":::

75&The opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people.":::"A large number of people might assert that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to older people than to younger people. Contrary to <del>the </del>popular belief, I agree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people for the following two reasons: benefiting recruitment, and relieving stress.<br>               To begin with, the opinions of celebrities are more crucial and influential to young people than to older people as <mod target = understanding>noticing</mod> <del>the </del>opinions guarantees success in <ins>people's </ins>career<ins>s</ins>. This is due to the fact that the when people listen<del>s</del> to the talk of celebrities, they can understand the social issues very effectively because the celebrities usually appear<del>s</del> <mod target = on various>to variety of</mod> media and express their thoughts. Moreover, as modern society is becoming increasingly globalized and competitive, today's job market<del>s</del> require<ins>s</ins> <del>a </del>job candidate<ins>s</ins> <mod target = that can>with such quality to</mod> comprehend social issues.  In addition<ins>,</ins> as most <del>of </del>young people need to get a job, while older people most likely <del>to </del>already have occupations, the importance and <del>the </del>effect of the opinions of celebrities are bigger to young people. According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2009, the employment interview was the most important component in the hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at the job <mod target = applicants'>applicant's</mod> knowledge and skills, mostly related to social issues such as terrorism or warfare.<br>              Furthermore, the point of views of famous people <mod target = are>is</mod> more vital and powerful to <ins>the </ins>younger generation as the views enable younger people to release more stress. This is attributed to the fact that listening to the<ins>ir</ins> opinions can make people <del>to </del>release their stress when the opinion matches <mod target = their>with</mod> own. And<del>,</del> young people tend to have more stress than older people as they <del>more </del>suffer<del>s</del> from <ins>more </ins>recruitment problem<ins>s</ins>, financial problem<ins>s</ins>, and social problems. Therefore, young people are more affected by the<ins>ir</ins> opinions as they have more stress to let off. According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2005, there was a significant difference between two groups of people in managing their pressure. People in group A were about 55 years old, and those in group B were about 25 years old. Both group watched television programs and frequently enjoyed <del>to </del>watch<ins>ing</ins> programs <mod target = where>that</mod> celebrities deliver<ins>ed</ins> <del>their </del>speech<ins>es</ins>.

To illustrate this further, just like watching movies in <mod target = a theater>play house</mod>, people should experience the same level of amusement and complacency (contentment) <del>of </del>watching it in their house. For instance, as the technology and interaction between different countries has swiftly augmented, immense screens and vast speaker systems in cinema to enhance customers' <mod target = enjoyment has>gladness have</mod> been replaced with rapidly ameliorated house T.V. screen<ins>s</ins> and sound technology. Therefore, even though cinemas shrink their profit<ins>s</ins> by decreasing ticket price<ins>s</ins>, it is less fascinating than before the innovation of the T.V. In this sense, seeing films at home might be more lucrative financially and physically.<br><br>In conclusion, watching films at home far outweigh being <mod target = at the theater>in cinema</mod>. As I mentioned above, people could watch movie<ins>s</ins> with ease and freedom at home.

Some people think that making public transportation free will cause a huge financial loss for <ins>the </ins>government.

Thus, it can be said that it is better to make public transportation free because it will increase <ins>the </ins>work efficiency of people who use public transportation.

Essentially, people who uses public transportation to work had lower stress level<ins>s</ins> compared to people <ins>who </ins>drive their own car<ins>s</ins> to work.

For example, when I was a freshman in university, my professor gave me a homework <ins>assignment </ins>to write a report on the peculiarity of the modern Chinese in <ins>a </ins>Chinese literature class. I didn't learn about that in the past, so I was emb<ins>ar</ins>rassed. Therefore what I need<ins>ed</ins> <mod target = were>was</mod> the references.

Although it is true that some people are required not to be judged adversely even if they are guilty, I totally believe that if bad people are not punished on TV, it will <del>greatly </del>have some negative effects on our society. In this essay, I will present a couple of reasons to support my idea. <br><br>To begin with, children are the ones who are not firmly mature, so they will be affected by most contents <del>shown </del>on TV. Specifically, children are likely to mimic <mod target = plentiful>the</mod> behavior <mod target = by>of </mod>people on TV because they lack the ability to discriminate <ins>between </ins>good behavior<del>s</del> and bad<del> ones</del>. Due to bad people's nice suits and impressive images made by TV producers some illegal behaviors may seem very cool for children even if <ins>they do </ins>not follow<del>ing</del> the rules and putting people's lives in jeopardy. According to recent news by <ins>the </ins>BBC<del>,</del> some sad accidents happened last week. Some children hit other kids who live in their neighborhood but<ins> in</ins> different apartments.

In this regard, TV should know <ins>it is</ins> influential and <mod target = duties>has a duty </mod>to educate children in a good way. <br><br>On top of that, some TV programs and movies do not<mod target =  have the intention> show</mod> that bad people eventually will be punished <ins>or</ins> have something to do with increased crime rates. To specify this, some people can misunderstand that a few illegal behaviors are not always punished and even do not cause people who did <ins>them</ins> pay <mod target = for>a </mod>fine. This <mod target = gives>gave </mod>rise to high crime rates recently. According to recent research conducted by the police department, a certain amount of crime has been broadcast<del>ed </del>on TV or was the topic of famous movie. For instance, 'Ocean's Eleven' that features many famous actors was considered as <mod target = a>the </mod>main reason why accidents related with robbing <del>of </del>bank<ins>s</ins> can be found<del>ed at</del> many times lately. Therefore, TV and movies should realize their potential <mod target = threateningon>for causing a threat to</mod> society and <ins>that they </ins>have <mod target = a tendency>the ability</mod> to make programs and scenes to encourage sound behaviors among people. <br><br>To sum up, if TV do<ins>es</ins> not show that guilty people are punished by law, not only will children have misconception<ins>s</ins> about their behavior<del> that they will have</del> but also crime rates will absolutely be so<ins>a</ins>ring.

121&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A teacher’s ability to relate well to students is more important than his or her ability to impart knowledge. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.":::"A large number of people might assert that a teacher's ability to impart knowledge is more important than his or her ability to relate well to students. Contrary to <del>the </del>popular belief, I agree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well to students is more crucial than the other ability for the following two reasons: lower level of stress, and higher study efficiency.<br><br>        To begin with, a teacher's ability to have good relationship<ins>s</ins> with students is more important than the other ability to deliver knowledge as the <mod target = former>prior</mod> ability enables students to have low<ins>er</ins> level<ins>s</ins> of stress. The positive relationship between students and faculty members can create <ins>a </ins>more comfortable and relaxing environment.

Stress is <ins>a </ins>huge factor that influence<ins>s</ins> students as it can often make students to have ADHD or other mental illness<ins>es</ins>. According to <ins>the </ins>Ministry of Education of Korea in 2011, there was a significant difference <ins>in stress levels </ins>between two groups of students<del> in stress level</del>. Students in Korea generally don't have <mod target = many>much</mod> opportunities to relate <mod target = to>with</mod> their teachers as teachers in Korea manage more than 40 students in a year as a home room teacher. On the other hand, students in Switzerland typically have more opportunities to relate <mod target = to>with</mod> their teachers as the teachers only manage 15 students in a year. In addition, elementary students in Switzerland visit<del>ed</del> parks or amusement park<ins>s</ins> at least four times in a year. The researchers found out that the stress level of students in Korea was 59 percent greater than that of students in Switzerland. This indicates that teachers' ability to relate well to students helps students <del>to </del>get less stress.<br><br>        Furthermore, a faculty member's ability to relate well to students is more critical than the other ability to confer their information to students since the first ability <mod target = helps>renders</mod> students <del>to </del>study with higher efficiency. This is attributed to the fact that when the students have good relationship<ins>s</ins> with their teachers, they can easily ask questions about their class materials, which greatly expands their knowledge. Also, the teachers with <mod target = this>the</mod> ability are likely to engage in active class discussion<ins>s</ins> or presentation<ins>s</ins> as these activities or performances help them <del>to </del>relate well with students.

Contrary to <del>the </del>popular belief, I agree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that the need to use land for agriculture, resident, and industry should be prioritized over the need to save the habitat of endangered animals for the following two reasons: importance of human life, and economic merits.<br>            <br>To begin with, the need to employ land for farming, housing, and industry is greater than the need to use land for preserving endangered animals as <del>the </del>human life is more valuable than that of endangered animals. This is due to the fact that human<ins>s</ins> <mod target = are>is</mod> a superior entity <mod target = to>than</mod> any other animal<del>s</del>, even if the animals are endangered. While human<del>'s</del> living standard<ins>s</ins> can be significantly improved by employing land for farming, housing, and industry, employing the land for animal<ins>s</ins> cannot contribute to benefiting human's <mod target = lives>life</mod>. By building infrastructures, farms, houses, and factories, people can create more places to rest<del>,</del> and work. According to the Ministry of Budget Management of Korea in 2011, 54 percent of available land in Korea was used for industrial, agricultural, and residential purposes.

This indicates the greater importance of land use for farming, housing, and industry over <del>the </del>land use for saving endangered animals.<br>            <br>Furthermore, the need to exploit land for agricultural, residential, and industrial use is more crucial than the need to use land for preserving endangered species since <del>the </del>farming, housing, and industrial land can <del>more </del>contribute <ins>more </ins>to <ins>the </ins>economy than land for animal protection. As contemporary society is becoming increasingly globalized and competitive, the importance of economy has increased.

In addition, land for industry is significantly advantageous in economy by producing goods such as computers and cars. Nevertheless, the land for preserving animals cannot <del>much </del>contribute <ins>much </ins>to <ins>the </ins>advancement of economy as the land cannot be commercialized or invested by any business entity. According to <del>the </del>Seoul National University, there was a huge difference between two countries in GDP and GDP per capita. <mod target = The two>Two</mod> countries are Japan and Congo. 64 percent of Japanese land is in use for agriculture, residential, and industrial purposes.

In order to become much more competitive, certain amounts of knowledge that students study <mod target = as part of>from</mod> their major is not enough. This is because <ins>the </ins>lack of ability to speak <ins>a </ins>second language may deprive a person of chances to show his or her great performances in the field<del>s</del>. Therefore, high school<ins>s</ins> are required to attempt to encourage students to get used to a foreign language to a certain extent. For instance, my high school <mod target = has a>have</mod> magnificent language programs to encourage students to improve their English or Japanese. My friends tried to study very hard to become proficient in both a second language and academic subjects. As a result, those who are equipped with an advanced level of language are now showing <del>a </del>great performance<ins>s</ins> in their field<ins>s</ins> and enjoying their successful lives. In this regard, a foreign language learned in high school is considerably helpful for students' future<ins>s</ins>. <br><br>On top of that, it seems that <mod target = university>high school</mod> students will not have sufficient time to study and get involved in a foreign language course because they have to spend their time reading their major books and doing assignments<del> in university</del>. To specify<del> this</del>, some people can say that <mod target = universities>university</mod> have diverse education programs associated with teaching a second language. However, it is likely that university students are so busy with their major that they do not have <del>a </del>room to concentrate <mod target = on>in</mod> a second language course. For example, when <del>being </del>asked about studying a foreign language, every university student said that they try to take part in that kind of class, but cannot help but go to the library to study their major. Therefore, high school should take <mod target = the>an</mod> appropriate action to give students chances to <mod target = explore>exploring</mod> a foreign language that they have wanted to learn. Probably, for them, high school <del>life </del>is a last chance to indulge themselves with learning a second language, so they need to receive a foreign language class, even if it is a basic course.<br>            <br>To sum up, it is essential for every high school student to study how to speak and read a foreign language because not only can they become much more competitive with <ins>the </ins>ability to talk to foreign people but also because they do not have enough time to study it when they are in university. In conclusion, all high school<ins>s</ins> should provide a foreign language course for students' bright future<ins>s</ins>.<br><br>":::

""133&Because environment issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.""":::"Nowadays, thanks to industrial development, people can enjoy lots of convenience but on the other hand, environment<ins>al</ins> issues, such as global warming, are serious<del>ly</del> menace<ins>s to</ins> us. Therefore we need to consider what to do to solve this problem. Although some people think that <mod target = they have nothing to>there is nothing they can</mod> do to revive environment<ins>al</ins> condition<ins>s</ins>, I strongly believe that small efforts can be a great help to make our environment better.

For example, if all people <ins>began to </ins>use tumblers of their own instead of paper cups which we can <mod target = use for only one time>only use once</mod>, huge amount<ins>s</ins> of trashes can be <mod target = reduced>eliminated</mod>. To be specific, let's assume that a student drink<ins>s</ins> <mod target = 3cups>three cups</mod> of water a day in school and there are 500 students in a school. If they only use instant paper cups or plastic ones, daily 1500 paper or plastic cups are thrown out<ins>.</ins> <mod target = and>And</mod> when it comes to <ins>on an </ins>annual basis, the number of wasted cups would be <del>more or less </del>500,000<ins>, give or take</ins>. We can easily find <mod target = this>these</mod> kind<ins>s</ins> of situations from our routines and therefore we should not overlook small amount<ins>s</ins> of daily garbage that we unintentionally desert.   <br><br>Also, individuals can make up organizations to recover our nature. That is, little interests of many people can be added up together, constructing tremendous scale<ins>s</ins> of environmental projects. Nonprofit institutes like UNESCO or UNICEF must have begun their <mod target = activity>activities</mod> from a person's <mod target = precipitation and by summing up more and more peoples>initiative and adding more and more people to</mod> such efforts. Like this, by continuously gathering many people who are willing to <mod target = precede>participate in</mod> environment<mod target =  >-</mod>related activities, individual efforts will not <mod target = be ended up as just a person's doing>end as singular efforts,</mod> but rather will result in <ins>a </ins>visible effect on our nature. For example, when I was in university, I belonged to <ins>a </ins>photograph club. One day, one of <ins>the </ins>club members suggested <mod target = us to>that we</mod> do some cleaning activities, complaining <ins>about a </ins>lack of proper place<ins>s</ins> <mod target = in>on</mod> our campus to take any picture<ins>s</ins> because of too <mod target = many>much</mod> garbage from here and there, and we began to picked <ins>up </ins>used bottles <del>up </del><mod target = in>on</mod> our campus and <del>we </del>posted notices that <mod target = warns>warned</mod> people not to throw any trash<del>es</del> out on the <del>bare </del>road. Since then we <mod target = could feel>felt</mod> that <ins>the </ins>campus <mod target = is>was</mod> changing. I suppose that if I or that member did so alone, this kind of radical change could not have occurred but group power composed of those of individuals enabled <ins>us </ins>to bring success up.<br><br>All in all, individuals efforts to revive our environment are very important not only because <mod target = that those, themselves,>they</mod> can affect our nature <mod target = in>on a</mod> tremendous scale but also because group power from personal <mod target = powers>efforts</mod> can bring about bigger results than those of <del>simply summed up of </del>individuals.

This is because unlike the older generation whose <mod target = economieswere>economy was</mod> based on agriculture and manufacturing which were mainly lobor-oriented, the younger generation is living in the information age.

136&People can benefit more from traveling in their own country than traveling to foreign countries.":::"In <ins>a </ins>globalized society, it is believed that people can get more advantages by traveling in their own <mod target = countries>country</mod> than traveling to foreign countries.

Through this experience, I realized that I can learn a lot of things such as other countries' languages, traditional and history by traveling another country even for a short period. Hence, this shows that having a time to trip foreign nations can help people to have new experiences.<br><br>In addition, people, especially students<ins>,</ins> can improve their spirit of independence.

137&It is better to choose a university whose graduates have good job opportunities than a university who has famous professors.":::"Getting a fine job is hard today since the population of the world is swiftly increasing. In order to get a job, many students attend a university whose graduates have good job opportunities. On the other hand, it might seem like pursuing idealism but it is better to choose a university who has famous professors because students can <ins>be </ins>guarantee<ins>d</ins> <ins>a </ins>high quality of education, and studying under renown<ins>ed</ins> professors gradually help<ins>s</ins> students to get <del>a </del>job<ins>s</ins>.  <br>          <br>Students should choose a university with famous professors since they can <mod target = get>have</mod> high quality <del>of </del>education<ins>s</ins>. A true education is <mod target = receiving high quality information>acknowledging the information with high quality</mod>, and this knowledge will allow them to be <del>a </del>wise<del> person</del>. Moreover, famous professors are famous for at least one reason. In fact, most of them are famous for their teaching skills, and leading students to be open-minded. Furthermore, many renowned professors are famous for stimulating students, leading students to <mod target = get>have a</mod> true education<ins>s</ins>, and make sure their students do not study<del>ing</del> just to have job opportunities. For example, I once had a chance to audit a lecture <mod target = by>of</mod> Chul Soo Ahn, who is well-known for inventing <ins>a </ins>vaccine for computers and disseminating it for free, when he was a professor in KAIST. I only audited two hours of <ins>the </ins>lecture, but it was <mod target = so>very</mod> impressive and moving that it made me <ins>want </ins>to invent various vaccine programs, not for money but to have a positive <ins>effect on the </ins>world. Likewise, famous professors allow students to do something they are majoring in, not <mod target = wasting>ruining</mod> money and time in a university like many other students. <br>              <br>Finally, it is better for a student to choose a university who has renowned professors since studying under renown<ins>ed</ins> professors would gradually lead to <del>have </del>job opportunities. It is true that many companies are looking for people who achieved higher quality of education to ensure they chose the right <mod target = people>person</mod> for their company. When applying <mod target = for>to have</mod> <del>a </del>job<ins>s</ins><del> opportunity</del>, companies would have <del>the </del>information <mod target = on every>of each</mod> university, and would also know if the university <mod target = is>if</mod> famous for <mod target = students getting hired>getting a job</mod> or <mod target = making>to make</mod> sure students truly studied the subject. There is also a policy in every company <mod target = about how many people they will hire>that how much proportion of people they are going to hire</mod> from each university<del> approximately</del>. It is, thus, easier <ins>for those who studied under famous professors with high quality of education </ins>to get accept<ins>ed</ins> <mod target = by>from</mod> the company<del> for those who studied under famous professors with high quality of education</del>. For example, when I attended Seoul National University in South Korea, I majored in electronic<ins>s</ins>.

Many teenagers think about what they are going to eat next, but it is not because they do not have any food left, but it is because they have too much to choose from.

Since the world has become more complex and increasingly specialized these days, it is hard to solve a problem within <ins>the </ins>knowledge of a certain field. Therefore, people need to cooperate with others from various fields and think flexibly, so that they can find out the better answer for a problem. <br><br>Second, participating in art and music classes relieves students' academic stress.

Especially for young students, drawing is an effective way to release emotions and relieve <mod target = their>the</mod> stress because drawing does not require difficult skills; less stress allows students to achieve better grades and have healthier minds. Therefore, providing quality art education to young students is very important. <br><br>In conclusion, I agree that schools should offer art and music classes for young students to teach them creative thinking skills and help them relieve the stress they get from studying.":::

In the real world, studying seemingly insignificant subjects not related to their major<ins>s</ins> is considered a waste of time. However, I definitely believe that students should study many subjects at the same time because it is helpful for them to find their jobs and to build up their personalities. <br><br>To begin with, taking courses in various subjects will help students find their dreams. To be specific, they have much <mod target = better>more</mod> chances <mod target = of realizing>to realize</mod> what they want to be and what they are good at by studying many different subjects.

In many cases, even <ins>if </ins>they know <del>the fact </del>that their friends are good at the subject, they get help from a professional tutor because they believe tutors are better than the students. However, it is better for students to ask their friends for help when they need help since students <mod target = are easier>know the best way to be easy</mod> to understand, <ins>the </ins>person who needs help would feel free to ask questions, and they can prompt each other to study more diligently. <br><br>People should ask their friends for help when they need extra help <mod target = with>in</mod> schoolwork because their friends would know the best way to be understood.

In Asian countries<ins>,</ins> including my country, it is rude to say bad things <mod target = even if>although</mod> it is true.

Neverthless, I strongly disagree with the idea that the decisions that people make quickly are always wrong for two specific reasons: some decision making<del>s</del> <mod target = are>is </mod>easy and do<ins>es</ins> not take <mod target = much>a lot of </mod>time to come up with right answers, and numerous problems do not have one definite answer.<br>          <br>To begin with, not all the briefly decided determinations are wrong because some matters do not take a long period of time to come up with a right answer. Most <del> </del>of them are extremely obvious <mod target = that>and </mod>do not even take a second to come up with a right answer. This is because people learn know-how by making similar decisions repeatedly. People face a number of similar decision making problems everyday. When they repeat the problem they learn to decide quickly and come up with correct answers at the same time. As a perfect example, there is a problem of deciding what to wear for the day. People wear clothes everyday to decorate themselves or to express who they are. It is a tough decision to make when people first face the problem.    However, people create their own standards and learn social norms throughout their lives and it becomes one of the easy problems to <mod target = come up with right decisions>solve</mod>. When there is a special occasion, it becomes even easier to decide what to wear.

According to the research conducted by the National Foundation of Research of Korea, 90 percent of people spend less than five minutes <mod target = to choose>choosing</mod> what to wear<ins>,</ins> and they are satisfied with their choice. As this research reveals, quickly made decisions are not always wrong.<br>          <br>In addition, some problems do not have one definite answer.

They help each other with school<del> </del>work<del>s</del> such as preparing <ins>for </ins>exams and doing homework. Also, they give <del>advice </del>each other <ins>advice </ins>on their problems. For instance, when I was in high school, I have always struggled to understand mathematics. No matter how <mod target = long>much time</mod> I put in to solve the problems, I <mod target = barely>rarely</mod> got the right answer. Therefore, my friend Eunjung, who is <ins>a </ins>math<mod target = -> </mod>genius, used to help me <mod target = to teach>by tutoring me in</mod> mathematics. Also, since she was not good at exercise, I have tried to run with her after school. We were so happy that we could help and motivate each other. Thus, friends have a huge impact on each other's lives.       <br>         <br>Furthermore, students are affected more by their friends because of peer pressure. It is obvious that students in adolescence tend to put <ins>the </ins>highest value on what others think because they want to fit in. They want to belong to the group and feel secure when they are <ins>a </ins>part of it.  According to the research done by Harvard Universi<ins>t</ins>y in 2007, 67% of students <del>in teen years </del>between age<ins>s</ins> 14 and 18 <ins>were </ins>willing to listen to their peers <ins>more </ins>than their teachers. They feel more accepted within social group<ins>s</ins> and like to be popular among<del>st</del> them. Thus, <mod target = firends>friends</mod> have <mod target = better>more</mod> impact in <ins>a </ins>teen's life.<br>         <br>To sum up, peers are more influenced by friends than by their teachers. Students not only spend a great deal of time with the<ins>i</ins>r friends but <ins>are </ins>also <del>are </del>easily persuaded by peer pressure. Therefore, I believe students are more <mod target = vulnerable to>influenced by</mod> their friends than teachers.<br><br>":::

However, after the <mod target = revolution of industries>Industrial Revolution</mod>, almost all things including economics, society, culture<ins>,</ins> and politics have <del>been </del>changed because the paradigm of a society <del>is </del>shifted from <ins>an </ins>agricultural basis <del>in</del>to the economic and service market. With the advent of capitalist society, people should make money, which is <del>the </del>power in <mod target = the>this </mod>kind of <mod target = societies>society</mod>, to live and succeed in their life. Such a trend <mod target = of>in </mod>society <mod target = enforces>encourages </mod>people to compete with each other, and the structure of the society has been changed and varied.

However, my view is that it is important to tell others who are influential or will employ you in the future your strength<ins>s</ins> and achievement<ins>s</ins> for <mod target = that>these</mod> reasons: success in career, health<del>y</del><ins>,</ins> and relationship<ins>s</ins>.<br><br>To begin with, when people inform others who will employ them of their strength<ins>s</ins> and achievement<ins>s, it</ins> has a direct correlation with <ins>their </ins>success in <ins>their </ins>career<ins>s</ins>. This is attributed to the fact that when people concentrate most of their time on showing their strength<ins>s</ins> such as <del>a </del>good communication skill, responsibility, and honesty, they can attract employer<ins>s</ins>. This is especially true given the fact that as modern society is becoming <ins>more </ins>specialized and competitive, today's job markets require job candidates <ins>with </ins>such qualities. According to the Ministry of Labor of Japan in 2012, the employment interview was the most important component, taking up more 80 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at applicants' knowledge and skills mostly related to specialty. The contributing factor was that the more interviewees appeal<ins>ed to</ins> their specialty, the more interviewers     looked at their resume<ins>s</ins>. This implies that presentation of strength is a secure way for people to prepare for the future.<br><br>In addition, when people do not inform others who are influential of <mod target = your>their</mod> achievement<ins>s</ins>, it deters people <ins>from </ins>staying healthy. This is attributed to the fact that<ins>,</ins> while people interact with others who have a great impact on their life<del> guarantee a stress-free life</del>, lack of showing their ability can stress people out by making them feel isolated. Moreover, stress is one of the main factors <mod target = of>that causes </mod>diseases through weakening the immune system. In a study conducted by Stanford University in 2012, a test on mice showed that life span was shortened when they regularly underwent a series of electric shocks. Interestingly, the researchers found a link between this and human beings who suffered from periodic stress. This implies that high stress levels coming from lack of appealing <mod target = of>to </mod>their strength could negatively affect humans, resulting in a shorter life span.<br><br>Last but not least, informing<mod target =  people's strength of others>others of a perso's strength</mod> can contribute to building a stronger relationship. This is attributed to fact that taking their ability <mod target = related to their achievement>into account, the </mod>other people who will employ them can create a comfortable atmosphere in which people can bond and have a good time. Otherwise, people who are influential or will hire you hardly have the chance to know about you. Therefore, through light-hearted conversations, they can be easily connected. For example, when I first met <mod target = my>the </mod>president of my company, I was very shy and had nothing common in with him. However, taking about my experience<ins>s,</ins> such as <mod target = got>winning a </mod>prize not only helped me to relax, but provided some intimate shared experience. To be specific, we bonded by <mod target = having a shares>sharing stories</mod> of personal strength. Such intimate communication easily opened up <mod target = out>our </mod>hearts to each other. <br><br>In brief, <ins>the </ins>advantages of good communication about your strength<ins>s</ins> and achievement<ins>s</ins> far outweigh<ins>s</ins> <mod target = those of>the</mod> disadvantages <mod target = of >from </mod>lack of informing others for the reasons I have mentioned above. All in all, the importance of taking about your strength cannot be underestimated in that it can catch two bird with one stone.<br><br>":::

First, individual activities have positive effects on people's thinking and activities.

This is attributed to the fact that people tend to take actions which are beneficial to themselves. This reminds me of my eco-project which I took when I was a university student<mod target = .>,</mod> The project was comprised of simple rules: if a person <mod target = engaged in>behaved</mod> eco-friendly activities <ins>and </ins>then took photos and sent <ins>them to </ins>me<del> them</del>, I gave them <mod target = an ""eco-point,"">'eco-point'</mod> which can be used as money <mod target = at>for</mod> my garage sale.

In Korea, there is a proverb <ins>that says </ins>if <mod target = small>samll</mod> things gather, <mod target = it will become>they will be</mod> a big thing. <mod target = This>which</mod> means a person's change can be<ins>come</ins> people's changes. According to the Ministry of Environment of Korea in 2003, there were many campaigns for environmental issues.

173&Parents should not allow their children to watch television so that they can do well at school.":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not parents should <del>not </del>allow their children to watch television so that they can do well <ins>in </ins>school. The answer to this question can <mod target = vary>very</mod> greatly depending on individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that parents <ins>should </ins>let children <del>to </del>watch television. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, by watching television, children can relieve overwhelming stress. Second, children <ins>can </ins>grow closer to their friends by sharing <del>the </del>information after watching television.     <br><br>First, children can find relief by watching television and thus they can concentrate on their <mod target = studies>study</mod> in school. These days, children suffer from high<mod target =  >-</mod>levels of stress caused by studying overtime. By watching television, children can temporarily forget about <mod target = their study problems>problems at study</mod>. In this respect, watching television is a great stress-reliever, which helps children <del>can </del>study well in school. To illustrate <ins>this point </ins>further<del> this point</del>, let me use <ins>the case of my brother </ins>as an example<del> the case of my brother</del>. He <ins>not only </ins>has to <del>not only </del>complete more tasks <del>now </del>at school<ins> now</ins>, but also has to interact with many people in order to prepare group presentation<ins>s</ins>. When he comes home, he tries to refresh his mind and body by watching television. <del>Through </del><mod target = Watching>watching</mod> television instantly provide<ins>s</ins> <del>an </del>excitement. For a short time, my brother seems to forget about <ins>the </ins>problems he has <del>had </del>at school and gains enough breathing space to look forward to studying the next day. <mod target = This illustrates that>As a result,</mod> parents should encourage their children to watch television.<br><br>Second, children are able to become closer to their friends, which helps children <del>can </del>study better in school. In today's competitive society, it is difficult to forge strong ties with <del>their </del>friends. <mod target = As>Aa</mod> a result, they may feel isolation not only from family, but also friends. In this context, watching television can help children <del>to </del>combat these social trends by enabling individual<ins>s</ins> to have fun with others. According to the Korean Gallup Poll, most <del>of </del>surveyed respondents indicated that watching television is a great way to strengthen <ins>their relationships </ins>with friends. The respondents said that they are able to laugh <del>out </del>together and talk about performances afterward. Indeed, children can overcome awkwardness that may exist not only among strangers, but also among acquaintances, which will be invaluable to children because they can adjust well in school. Therefore, parents should not prevent children <mod target = from>to</mod> watch<ins>ing</ins> television.  <br>   <br>In conclusion, I strongly argue my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. Thus, <ins>though </ins>the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that the two <del>of my </del>rationales above are sufficiently convincing en<del>c</del>ough to the represent <del>to </del>the viewpoint<ins>s</ins> of a majority of people who are <ins>in </ins>favor <mod target = of>in</mod> my claim.<br><br>":::

174&People today would be happier if they have few possessions.":::"There is an argument <mod target = over>about </mod>whether people today would be happier if they have few<ins>er</ins> possessions. I agree that having few possessions would make people happier for two reasons. First, desire for more possessions causes serious environmental problem<ins>s</ins>. Second, having too many possessions will make people <mod target = stressful>stressed</mod>.<br><br>First of all, environmental problem<ins>s</ins> can <del>be </del>occurred <mod target = by>from the </mod>desire for more possessions. Some people might say that people today would be happier if they have more possessions. However, let me show <ins>you </ins>an example to prove why having few possessions is better. Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world. Floods and landslides took countless people as well as placing affected areas at health risk. European nations were no exception. Many areas were flooded and suffered wildfires. Sadly, it was extremely costly to ensure that all victims <mod target = were>could </mod>put their lives back together. Carbon emissions from cars and factories are largely responsible for this environmental problem. Desire for more possessions requires shipping by cars and producing in factories and it will release a lot of carbon emissions. Therefore, if people need more possessions, it will <mod target = draw>create </mod>more environmental problems. This shows that people will be unhappy with many possessions since it <mod target = occurs>contributes to </mod>global warming.  <br><br>Second, people will be stressed out if they have too many possessions. A growing number of people want to live in the countryside since many of them are not satisfied with urban life. To be specific, there are many attractive goods in the city. So, people are easily tempted to buy<del>ing</del> those products such as cell phones and fashionable clothes. In this situation, people are pushed to buy new items when they are released since old items can't meet urban people's needs. However, people are easily under stress because it requires a lot of money to purchase those items. Also, if people don't purchase those possessions, <mod target = they are>it is </mod>not only hard to stay <del>in </del>healthy mentally but also difficult to socialize with people in the city. Consequently, many people recently have moved to the countryside since there are not many possessions. People <ins>that have </ins>lived in the rural area<ins>s</ins> say<del>s</del> that they can relieve their stress and socialize with many people more easily without newfangled items. This proves that today's people couldn't be happy with many possessions since they generate too much stress to people.<br><br>In conclusion, I agree that having few possessions would make people happy for the reasons I have mentioned. First, environmental problem<ins>s</ins> can <del>be </del>occurr<del>ed</del> by desire for more possessions. Second, people will be stressed out if they have too many possessions.<br><br>":::

175&Games can teach us valuable lessons about life.":::"There are many games in our society and many people claim that games are useless and harmful to people, because they cause a variety of problems. However, in my opinion<ins>,</ins> games have <del>benefits which </del>can help people <del>to </del>develop the ability <mod target = to make plans>of making a plan</mod>, and they can also help children learn rules in our society.<br>              <br>First of all, games teach us the ability to develop <mod target = strategies>a strategy</mod>. People cannot live without planning because they would never know what will happen in the future. So people have to prepare <ins>for </ins>the future by developing <mod target = strategies>a strategy</mod>. To do this, people should learn what will happen if they behave in a certain way, and make <del>a </del>plan<ins>s</ins> to achieve a goal. Games teach us the ability to make <del>a </del>plan<ins>s</ins>. For example, in a chess game, players should be prudent when they make <del>a </del>decision<ins>s</ins>, because one mere mistake can bring serious problems which can lead to <mod target = loss>lose</mod>. Consequently, the player<ins>s</ins> need to predict the next step before acting and make a strategy to win the game. This predicting and planning can be applied in real life. In a <mod target = negotiation>negatiation</mod>, one can predict the next claim of <ins>the </ins>other and prepare for <ins>the </ins>proper <mod target = reaction>reacting</mod>. <br>         <br>On top of that, games are <mod target = a>one of</mod> good way<del>s</del> to teach children rules. In our society, there are many rules which people should follow and children need to learn those. They do not know the importance of rules yet because they are still young. Their parents and teacher<ins>s</ins> can teach rules and their importance by words, but this is not enough<ins>,</ins> because its impact is weak and <mod target = this method>its way</mod> is boring to children. One way to teach them rules is games. For instance, children love to play games and they are eager to achieve their goal in a game. By playing games, children <mod target = start to understand that>get to know</mod> they should behave in a certain way when playing games, because they cannot achieve their goal by not following the rule<ins>s</ins>. They <ins>can </ins>also <del>can </del>learn what the result will be if they <mod target = violate>violent</mod> the rule<ins>s</ins> because they will <del>be </del>receive a penalty for their <mod target = violations>violenting</mod>. In this way, children can <ins>learn </ins>the importance of rules naturally. <br>         <br>In conclusion, there are several advantages <mod target = to>in</mod> games.

176&One can learn a lot more about a person from the type of friends that he has.":::"An ongoing debate exists over whether people can <mod target = more obtain>obtain more</mod> information about a person by observing the person's friends. Some people believe that the common quality between a person and the<ins>ir</ins> friends give<ins>s</ins> something a person has because a person spends more time on being with them. However, contrary to the opinion, I maintain that determining a person's personality by being base<ins>d</ins> on <ins>the </ins>friends a person has is wrong. This is largely because it is an indirect approach to a person. Moreover, many people are apt to being attracted <mod target = by>to </mod>those who <mod target = is>are </mod>different from themselves. <br>           <br>To begin with, it will be an indirect clue to know<del> friends</del> a person <ins>by their friends</ins>. As a result, such a clue will mislead people <mod target = to>when trying to </mod>perceive a person. In my case, when I was in high school, I regard<ins>ed</ins> a student who has violent friends as <ins>a </ins>violent student. Later on, I found the student very kind because I ask<ins>ed</ins> the student for the help <del>of</del> solving some problems and then the student didn't complain <ins>about</ins> my asking and helped me.

177&People can learn more from watching TV than from reading books.":::"Many people, especially adults<ins>, </ins> often say that there is nothing to learn from TV, arguing that rather it would be better to read a book. In fact, there is <mod target = anything>some  material </mod>to learn in entertainment TV programs, but not all TV programs are not like that. There are helpful contents <mod target = in>on </mod>TV. So<ins>,</ins> I would like to talk about benefits of watching TV, in terms of learning. <br>         <br>First of all, TV helps people learn by evoking a variety of sense<ins>s</ins>. Documentary programs <mod target = treat>cover </mod>a wide range of knowledge including flora or fauna, history, and natural science. This is like a<mod target =  book of>n </mod>encyclopedia.

Therefore, I came to understand the related books better in school, and this brought me high grades in subject such as natural science or history.<br>          <br>On top of that, people have hard time understanding by just reading a book. When people read, they use their imagination which is unclear and opaque. Moreover, this imagination can be different from real knowledge, which can lead people misunderstand. On the other hand, TV convey<ins>s</ins> a clear and obvious image or sound to people, which can help people understand better. For instance, I often have <ins>a </ins>hard time understanding the outward appearance of a certain animal or the interaction of chemical integration by reading a book<del>,</del> because its demonstration is abstract. However, I can understand much better by seeing the real image of that animal and the computer graphic<del>h</del> of the integration of chemical elements. <br>         <br>In conclusion, TV helps people learn and understand better than a book does. This is because it brings people's interest by giving the image and sound which have <ins>a </ins>great impact on people. In addition, they can understand well by watching TV because it gives clear image and sound which help understand abstract depiction well.

For example, when you study <del>a </del>history of social science, it will take a lot of time reading all kinds of history books. However, if you learn it from a teacher by listening <mod target = to a>the</mod> lecture, you will be able to understand the whole picture in a shorter period. In other words, learning from a teacher is similar to reaching the destination by using an airplane; on the other hand, studying alone can be compared to <del>lonely </del>walking a long<ins>, lonely</ins> journey on <ins>your </ins>feet by yourself.<br><br>In addition, having a teacher when you learn some tasks is a more effective way than teaching yourself. One of the examples for it  is when you learn how to cook. If you start learning <del>the </del>cooking skill<ins>s</ins> by yourself, you will have to get through a number of trials and errors to master it. Sometimes, you may burn flour and eggs as well as other ingredients by ill-controlled temperature on the stove.

In addition to this, one can preserve books over <del>a </del>multiple <del>of </del>decades, a<ins>n</ins> attribute that <mod target = made>makes</mod> books <ins>a </ins>more <mod target = affective>effective</mod> media <mod target = of>for</mod> information throughout time.  <br> <br>To start with, I think books are more capable of conveying information, because <del>video formed </del>information <ins>in video form </ins>is not <ins>as </ins>detailed as books.

I rather think that it is much better to a<ins>c</ins>quire <ins>as </ins>many kinds of skills as possible<del> as one can</del>. <br>         <br>To begin with, investing in one skill has a great risk. There are many specialists in the world and it means that it is hard to be the best in <mod target = one>a</mod> certain field. In addition, it is risky to focus on one thing. This is because if <ins>some</ins>one fail<ins>s</ins> in <mod target = this>that one</mod> field, there would be no <mod target = other way to which one can resort>where else they can turn</mod>. In <mod target = the finance>finance</mod>, there <mod target = are the word>is something called</mod> diversification in the portfolio theory. It suggest<ins>s</ins> that one should not invest all effort<del>s</del> in one field, <ins>but </ins>instead one should invest <ins>in </ins>several fields so that he or she can diversify the risk. Therefore, I think many kinds of skills are more helpful than one skill.

Although it is hard to be the best in one field, it is much more <mod target = possible>likely </mod>to be <mod target = the>a </mod><del>multi</del>player in many fields. Our society needs a person who can do well in several area<ins>s</ins>, not <del>a best </del>in <ins>just </ins>one skill. This can be <mod target = proved>proven </mod>by the fact that many companies prefer<del>s</del> one who <mod target = can do>is skilled in</mod> many fields such as a <ins>good</ins> performance in his or her department, skills of his or her profession<ins>,</ins> or even human relationships. <mod target = And>Also, </mod>this brings more possibility to promote <del>in </del>a company.

My reasons for this are that I can get high<ins>er</ins> quality education and huge public transportation. I will explain them below. <br><br>First of all, a big city provides various educational <mod target = opportunities>chances</mod>  <del>going </del>through diverse experiences.

Moreover, you can save <ins>more of </ins>your valuable time <ins>living in a big city </ins>than <del>living </del>in a small town<ins>,</ins> thanks to public transportation. Today, gas prices <mod target = are>is</mod> rising gradually. In this regard, using public transportation instead of <del>using </del>car<ins>s</ins> can <mod target = reduce>save</mod> our cost of living. For instance, <mod target = when>When</mod> we move <mod target = somewhere>anywhere</mod> <mod target = and>if we</mod> buy metro <mod target = Unlimited>Umlimited</mod> ti<ins>c</ins>kets<ins>,</ins> it is <mod target = more economically efficient>bring more economic fares</mod>.

""192&In today's world, the ability to cooperate well with others is more important than it was in the past.

However, many people think cooperation is more important <ins>a </ins>factor these days than <ins>in </ins>prior periods, which is not true due to two reasons.<br><br>First and for<ins>e</ins>most, I think the period <mod target = that>when </mod>cooperation with other people was <mod target = the most>at its highest </mod><del>pointed out was </del><ins>during</ins> the agricultural period <mod target = during>of </mod>mankind<ins>'s</ins> history<del>, much more than now</del>. When human beings' <mod target = first period was to raise crops>were raising crops during this period</mod>, cooperation was extremly important because a person or two cannot finish the whole process of agriculture. Since <del>the </del>technology was not well developed<ins> at that time</ins>, machines for rasing crops did not exist and people <mod target = have>had </mod>to do their work by their own hands with just simple tools.

Some people may believe that such rules are not necessary while others deem otherwise. However, I strongly believe that the existence of costume regulation at school and work is crucial.

There are many arguments to support my position, but the two main reasons are stated and explained in detail below.<br><br>Most importantly, parents today have a greater influence on their children than they did the past. This is because, recently, parents can help children to develop their talents by observing them close at hand. Today, young people lead highly scheduled lives as the world becomes more competitive and fast-paced than ever. As a result, they can miss chances to stumble on the fields they actually desire to study. This explains the need for parents' involvement in honing children's talents and potential that might have been buried for many years. Referring to a study conducted by Stanford University, experts now argue that students who have <ins>a </ins>close connection with their parents not only choose the correct path at an early age but also develop their true potential holistically. Actually, most surveyed respondents stated that they might have wasted much time if it had not been for <ins>their </ins>parents' counseling and assistance during their early years. <br><br>In addition, nowadays<del>,</del> parents' influence on young people is become more important than ever.

Generally, students are immature and fallible day by day, and<mod target =  at such time>as such</mod><del>,</del> parents must teach them societal values and <del>thus</del> lend a helping hand in directing them to become useful members of society.

Since they lack <del>enough</del> experience, they are likely to consider following the wrong path. However, if young people ask for the help of their parents, they can learn how to fix their moral standards and match the societal values they learned about to real-life circumstances. Through such guidance, young people can resist the temptation of taking drugs and thus grow up as good citizens. <br><br>Due to these reason, my argument is worthy of being supported regardless of its logical flaws. Indeed, the role of older people such as parents<del>,</del> <ins>and </ins>teachers should not be overlooked, but rather be highly regarded over time.<br><br>":::

No one would agree that studying one's major is the only reason that universities exist. There are several other important roles for universities and learning communication skills is one of them. Communication <mod target = skill is>skills are</mod> very important during people's<mod target =  life>lives</mod> and universities are very good <mod target = place>places</mod> to learn <mod target = about it>them</mod>. By taking different classes, students can take part in a variety of team <mod target = works>efforts</mod> such as making a report with their team members or going to <del>the</del> historical places with<mod target =  team members>them</mod> during a history class. While students try to do their own part during different kinds of classes, they can learn how to communicate with others, how to <del>solve</del> discuss with others, and how to solve problems when <mod target = argues>arguments</mod> occur. These activities are definitely helpful for students.<br><br>Finally, students can make sure their major is really what they want while they take other classes. Many students enter universities because they want to learn more about what they are interested in. However, not all students choose <mod target = a>the</mod> right major <mod target = that they really want to learn>for them</mod>.

Students go to school everyday and they spend most of their time there with friends. They are all in same situation, having similar problems and thoughts, and therefore it is easy for them to share their opinions with friends. By sharing common things with friends, students tend to believe and trust each other, depending on one another. This makes students be influenced by their friends more. On the other hand, although teachers spend time with their students as well, teachers have to care for every single <mod target = students>student</mod> in class, resulting in lack of attention to focus on <mod target = indivisuals>individuals</mod>. This affects how the students feel about their teachers and in the end <ins>they have </ins>less trust for them, <ins>thus they are</ins> less influenced. To be specific, there are a lot of cases <mod target = that>where</mod> students listen to their friends' <mod target = opinion>opinions</mod> at once while <mod target = refuse>refusing</mod> to listen to their parents' opinion<ins>,</ins> thinking that they are just nagging. This shows the reason why students are influenced more by their friends than by their teachers.<br><br>In addition, students feel more comfortable when they are with their friends rather than their teachers. Students and teachers are different  in many ways no matter how hard the teachers try to be friendly with students. <ins>The </ins><mod target = Teachers'>teachers'</mod> job is to lead the students in <mod target = a>the</mod> right way and also to give knowledge to students.

I believe that there is <mod target = not>no</mod> better way of becoming close with unknown people than playing <del>a </del>game<ins>s</ins> with them. When many male students in Korean university go to a picnic with <del>other </del><mod target = girl>female</mod> students, they often play <del>a </del>game<ins>s</ins> with the <mod target = girl>female</mod> students in a garden. Sometimes a male student may lose the game consciously because <del>a penalty from </del>losing a game makes the relation<ins>ship</ins> between him and his girl more loving. <br><br>In conclusion<ins>,</ins> I disagree that playing a game is only when winning because we can <mod target = make our healthy body>improve our health</mod>, progress our skill<ins>s,</ins> <del>through a game </del><mod target = or>and</mod> <mod target = become friendly with unknown plays>make new friends</mod>.":::

""":::"It is commonly said that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. People tend to think that the reason why communication vanishes is <del>watching</del> television. Personally, I don't agree with that. We seem to forget the fact that no one is forcing us to sit in front of <ins>the</ins> television. Furthermore, television provides us with many issues to be thought <ins>about</ins> together. In this essay, I will demonstrate why television has a good effect on our communication rather than a bad one.<br> <br>First, we need to realize that no one is forcing us to watch television. For example, I usually like watching news programs on television although I am not forced to do that. Even at this time, I am willing to stop watching television if someone asks me to talk about something. Therefore, I think that television is just a tool and never interferes our communication.<br><br>Second, television provides us with many issues which have never been talked about. For example, when I was watching a news program yesterday, I was suprised at the fact that toys imported from another country had been made of toxic substances. Consequently, I could talk about dangerous toys around us with colleagues.<br><br>In conclusion, I think that television has never destroyed people's communication. People who do not agree with this might hardly talk about issues given by television with other people.

A single student would only need a pair of uniforms to wear <mod target = in>to</mod> his school and he <mod target = won't>wouldn't</mod> have to pay extra cash for other clothes. In fact, I think it is also fair for everyone because no one would be particulary special in terms of clothes<ins>,</ins> which we are very sensible to at this age.

I</mod>t <mod target = will>would</mod> certainly provoke conflicts among jealous students.<br><br>Thirdly, it looks more elegant and polite for students to wear uniforms.

This is attributed to the fact that having lived a long time, they have already experienced many things in life, such as rebellion, having to fit in, and getting good grades in school. Thus, they have <mod target = bigger>broader</mod> views on these matters and are able to provide a more satisfactory and objective solution.

Finally, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding on my part and had I not spoken to him first, we would never have cleared <ins>up </ins>the issue which could have cost <ins>us</ins> our friendship.

""507&Choose one of the following activities and explain why you think the activity is the best way for students to make new friends.
-Joining a sport team
-Participating in community activities
-Traveling""":::"A large number of people might argue that traveling and joining a sports team are the best way for students to make new friends. Contrary to popular belief, I believe that the best method is <del>to</del> participating in community activities for two reasons: broadening one's perspective and relieving stress.<br> <br>To begin with, joining in <del>a</del> community activities allows students to broaden <mod target = one's horizon>their horizons</mod> and to learn to socialize with others. This is attributed to the fact that the activity exposes them to <ins>a</ins> different world of lifestyles, basic customs, and cultures. Through this experience, they can learn to embrace diversity. This is especially true given the fact that modern society is becoming increasingly globalized. For instance, when I was in eleventh grade, there was a Malaysian girl who brought home-cooked meals, such as 'Nasillamak', which is a Malaysian traditional food, for lunch. It smelled funny and she ate with her hands without using utensils, and other students kept their <mod target = distances>distance</mod> from her <mod target = who>because they</mod> had never seen such a thing before.

This indicates that participating in community activities <mod target = allow>allows</mod> students to have <del>a</del> foreign <mod target = friend>friends</mod>.<br> <br>Furthermore, <del>the performances that require students to</del><mod target =  help>helping</mod> others <mod target = via involving in community activities>through community involvement</mod> <mod target = enable>enables</mod> students to lower their stress level, and thus <mod target = having>have</mod> more friends. This is due to the fact that such activities can distract people from worries and stress. It is obvious that the activity can distract them from personal worries and concern since they have to care <ins>for</ins> the people <mod target = in>with </mod>desperate needs. Therefore, this kind work may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing their academic pressure. Students in Group A who frequently engaged in community service<mod target =  activity>activities</mod> <mod target = have>had</mod> much less stress <del>level</del> than those in Group B who rarely engaged in <mod target = the activity>such activities</mod>. The reaserchers also found out that those in Group A had more friends than those in Group B.

Although it is true that older people have experienced and learned a lot as they age, I believe that older people can have numerous benefits if they listen to the younger ones. In this essay, I am going to give two reasons supporting my idea.<div><br>           To begin with, there have been a number of technological developments that older people had never <mod target = met>encountered</mod> before. These days, the pace of <mod target = science>scientific</mod> improvement is getting faster and faster, so it is very tough for older people to catch up with trends.

Otherwise, they might lose valuable opportunities to see their loved ones' <mod target = photo>photos</mod> <del>in</del> any time and any place.<br><br>           On top of that, it is very effective for older people to <mod target = cooperative>cooperate</mod> and listen to younger people`s <mod target = advices>advice</mod>. It is natural that older people do <mod target = great performances>well</mod> in their work because they have accumulated lots of <mod target = experiences>experience</mod> and <ins>have </ins>overcome substantial obstacles.

In order to adapt to the harshness of the modern lifestyle, people have become increasingly <mod target = in different>indifferent</mod> to those around them. Consequently, the traditional notion of friendship has weakened and family ties have loosened. However, people can restore the value of friendship and family life by developing the environment. This is because people can get together with their friends and family in clean and nice parks thanks to the company's effort to support the environment.</div><div><br>A recent study<del>, which is</del> done by Stanford <mod target = Univ.>University</mod><del>,</del> found that having a good park near home <mod target = provide>provided</mod> useful opportunities for people who <mod target = are>were</mod> struggling to connect with their families and peers.

Not only that, students can enjoy <mod target = more>a larger</mod> variety of subjects<del> of their interest</del> as well. Students might have their own field of interest; for some, language learning is considered more important , while others would be more inclined to high-tech related areas. <del>And</del> <mod target = it>It</mod> is imperative for students to have appropriate providers in order to have <ins>the </ins>necessary education. However, limited numbers of <mod target = school>schools</mod> available in <ins>the</ins> country can prevent <mod target = us>them</mod> from having that.

This is highly significant for one's quality of life.

This is attributed to the fact that having homework everyday can stress the students out by making them worry about how to finish <mod target = them>it</mod> after class everyday. Moreover, stress is one of the main factors of disease through weakening the immune system. According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2009, a test on mice showed that life span was shortened when they regularly underwent <ins>a </ins>series of electric shocks.

This shows that if the television advertising <mod target = directs>is directed</mod> toward children, telling that the product is good, children will just want to have those products without any reasons.<br><br>In addition, television advertising can harm the children's health.

Contrary to popular belief, I believe that individuals cannot deal with environmental issues for <ins>the</ins> following reasons: economic loss, and intense stress that <ins>is </ins>derived from <ins>an </ins>attempt to resolve them.<br> <br>To begin with, <ins>the </ins>individuals' <mod target = tries>attempts</mod> to <mod target = recover>save</mod> <ins>the</ins> environment hinder people from living <ins>a</ins> happy life. This is due to the fact that money that originated from depleting natural resources tends to represent their power in society by showing their ability to attain whatever they want<ins>,</ins> ranging from fancy cars to even trust in <ins>a </ins>relationship. To explain, in modern society, <ins>the </ins>economy <ins>is </ins>developed by consuming natural assets such as <mod target = woods>wood</mod> and coal. The activities that utilize such materials certainly damage <ins>the</ins> environment. Hence, it can be deemed that <mod target = deeds>attempts</mod> to reconstruct <ins>the </ins>environment by hampering such activities can negatively affect people in terms of finance. Therefore, individuals <mod target = attempt>attempting</mod> to heal <ins>a </ins>damaged environment will be avoided by <ins>the</ins> majority of people. This is especially true given the fact that modern society runs on materialism. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea in 2010, there was a huge difference between two groups of employees in <ins>the</ins> <mod target = happy>happiness</mod> index. Employees in Group A owned a house and those in Group B rented a house. The researchers found that the level of happiness of Group A was much higher than that of Group B. Moreover, more than 60 percent of the workers in Group B underwent a severe depression. They constantly <mod target = worry>worried</mod> about paying rent in order to maintain a roof over their head. This indicates that money or economic benefit that came from anti-eco-friendly acts makes life easier and more comfortable.<br> <br>In addition, working on environmental issues<mod target =  in>on</mod> <ins>the</ins> individual level <mod target = arise>creates</mod> stress<mod target =  to>for</mod> many people. <del>This is attributed to the fact that such works can bring worries and stress to them.</del> It is obvious that <mod target = involving>becoming involved</mod> <ins>in</ins> such activities can stress people out since most of modern society is closely related to factors that destroy <ins>the </ins>environment. To be specific, general products that people use such as computers, fancy clothes, and <mod target = microwave>microwaves</mod> are the factors that harm <ins>the </ins>environment. These products require natural resources such as soil and rare <mod target = gem>gems</mod> to be produced. Therefore, this <mod target = complex>complexity</mod> <del>projects to deal with environmental issues</del> may actually serve as a <mod target = stress arousal source>source of stress</mod>. According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, there was a significant difference between two groups of students in managing their academic pressure. Students in Group A who rarely engaged in eco-friendly performances were more satisfied with their school lives than those in Group B who frequently joined <del>to</del> such activities. On the other hand, those in Group B were involved in dangerous activities such as smoking, drinking, and stealing to cope with their stress. This implies that <del>the</del> eco-friendly works can become a common pain for individuals.<br> <br>In brief, although many people urge that environmental issues can be alleviated by each person, such activities will be ignored by <ins>the </ins>vast majority of people for the reasons that I have mentioned above.

531&It is more advantageous for children to grow up in rural areas than in big cities.":::"It has been argued among some people whether children can get more benefits when they are raised in <ins>a </ins>rural <ins>area</ins> than when they spend their childhood in big cities. Although it is true that growing up in <ins>an </ins>urban <ins>area</ins> <mod target = enable>enables</mod> children to experience a lot of developed and convenient things, I believe that children can grow <mod target = as a better person>into better people</mod> if they are raised in <ins>a </ins>rural area. In this essay, I am going to provide two examples supporting my idea.<br><br>           To begin with, the countryside can encourage children to have a lot of experience <del>that they can touch and</del> <mod target = interact>interacting</mod> with nature, which <del>make</del> <mod target = them keep>keeps them</mod> healthy. Children who stay in the city have difficulty trekking, swimming and hiking. It is pretty hard for them feel nature in the first hand<del>, even if great environment is necessary for them to develop their health</del>. On the contrary, children who live in <ins>a </ins>rural region are surrounded by <mod target = many beautiful natures>beautiful scenery</mod>. They can experience a lot for things related to <ins>the </ins>environment<ins>, and</ins> as a result they have more opportunity to have physically healthy attributes. According to recent survey by <ins>the </ins>BBC, children who grow up in the countryside achieve greater performance in<del> the</del> physical activities than ones who live in <ins>a </ins>city.<br>           On the top of that, <ins>the </ins>city is relatively dangerous, <mod target = however>but</mod> the countryside is very safe<mod target =  for>from</mod> any crime or accidents, so children can spend their childhood very safely. There have been a number of <mod target = criminal>criminals</mod> that focus on children recently. Children now are exposed to very dangerous things such as very fast <mod target = car>cars</mod> on the road or drunken men who are likely do anything<del> that we cannot expect</del> in <ins>the </ins>city. In contrast, the countryside provides them with <del>such</del> a safe environment that cannot be harmful to them. People who live in rural <mod target = area>areas</mod> are so nice and kind that they <mod target = are>will</mod> not threaten children. <del>And</del> <mod target = also>Also</mod><ins>,</ins> there is <del>a</del> little traffic on the road and there is no reason to hurry in that kind of rural area. <mod target = So>Therefore</mod><ins>,</ins> the possibility that children can get <ins>in </ins>accidents in the countryside is much lower than <del>one</del> in the city.<br><br>           To sum up, the countryside enables children to grow up in <del>the</del> safe and healthy surroundings<ins>,</ins> and it really helpful for them to live <ins>in </ins>and make their own world. Therefore<ins>,</ins> I certainly believe that it is more beneficial for children to grow up in the countryside<ins>.</ins>":::

532&Cooperation is more important in today's society than the past.":::"In today's complicated society, it is believed that there are many things to do which <mod target = requires>require</mod> teamwork<ins>,</ins> like farming in the past. Some people advocate that <mod target = a current person>the people of today</mod> should invest almost <ins>their </ins>entire time to develop <mod target = his or her>their</mod> own competence to achieve something rather than cooperation. However, I disagree with this view. I firmly believe that the ability to cooperate with others <ins>has </ins>become much more important than <mod target = the past time>in the past</mod>. It is because it is hard for one person to <mod target = treat whole things>do much by him or herself,</mod> and today's society <del>has stretched works in the world which</del> <mod target = require>requires</mod> more and more understanding about other cultures.<br><br>To begin with, achieving something successfully by oneself <ins>has </ins>become <ins>more </ins>difficult compared to the past. As technology has developed, a lot of fields are <mod target = concretely>more</mod> sophisticated. That is, people have hard time finding out <ins>about </ins>other fields unrelated to their jobs. In addition, today's <mod target = times put>world puts</mod> importance on fusion <mod target = among>in different</mod> areas<ins>,</ins> like a <mod target = compound>merger</mod> of art and <mod target = cell-phone>cellphones</mod><ins>, for example</ins>. Many consumers do not buy a new <mod target = cell-phone>cellphone</mod> model just because its design is appealing or it has <del>merely </del>original functions. They purchase <ins>it </ins>when both<del> two</del> factors <mod target = fits>fit</mod> with their preference. It shows well <ins>that </ins>the consumer's needs <ins>have </ins>also become complicated and diverse. If a designer and an engineer strive <mod target = for inventing>to invent</mod> a new model together, the procedure would be more efficient <mod target = as>if</mod> their diverse knowledge would be reflected <mod target = on>in</mod> it. That is, it can also <del>a</del> increase the probability of making a breakthrough. As a result, nowadays competent designers and engineers collaborate together to <mod target = satiate>satisfy</mod> requirements from people in leading companies. In addition, it is common <mod target = that>for</mod> universities <ins>to </ins>promote team projects for their students to be able to cope with <mod target = works>projects</mod> which need <del>a</del> coordination among people in different realms in their future jobs. Accordingly, cooperation can allow people to <mod target = accomplish bigger success>be more successful</mod>.<br><br>Moreover, the chance to work with people from other countries has been increasing. It is because many globalized companies <mod target = has sprang>have sprung</mod> up around the world. It means that they require employees who can cooperate with foreigners. The cooperation <del>especially</del> includes <mod target = requisite>prerequisites</mod> such as <mod target = the>an</mod> understanding about other cultures and proficiency <mod target = of>in</mod> English. If a group composed of only Koreans works in China, <mod target = they couldn't get any success>they wouldn't be very successful</mod>. When they employ the native people in China, they can achieve<mod target =  a>the</mod> goal of their enterprise. For example, a famous international pizza company <mod target = made success>was successful </mod>through naturalization. The success required <mod target = natural>native</mod> employees' help who <mod target = know>knew</mod> well what <mod target = taste and savor are>tastes and flavors were</mod> preferred by residents in a specific country. Thus, it shows that when people start <del>to</del> <mod target = business>businesses</mod> in other countries, they need to employ and cooperate with native people.<br><br>In conclusion, it is my belief that cooperation is <ins>a </ins>more <mod target = indispensible>indispensable</mod> factor in current society<del> rather</del> than <ins>in</ins> the past. It <mod target = is heard>was reported</mod> in a news article that many people try to begin their own company, <ins>but only</ins> about 5% <ins>of </ins>companies survive in <ins>the </ins><mod target = markets>market</mod> after 10 years.

673&Television has had a significant influence on the culture of many societies.

They argue that television transfers lots of information to people and helps them know various <mod target = society's>societies'</mod> cultures. However, I disagree with this argument and think television actually has negatively affected the cultural development of our society. My view can be greatly substantiated by the <mod target = reason>reasons</mod> addressed below.<br><br>First of all, television has made people become passive and this leads <ins>to</ins> the regression of civilization. In other words, people <del>in</del> nowadays, who should play a pivotal role in developing the culture of society, are not thinking creatively because of the influence of television. People tend to accept information from television with no criticism, according to a study conducted by <ins>a</ins> MIT research team. They investigate how media can affect people's thinking abilities. Among many mediums, television is the worst media as it affects viewers to become passive. They just absorb information and knowledge from <ins>the</ins> television and believe it is true, even if it is <mod target = wrong.This>wrong. This</mod> is harmful to the cultural development of society. The improvement of our society requires <ins>a</ins> critical, voluntary, creative and active attitude toward received information and knowledge. Because television lacks these qualities, I firmly believe television is negative to our society.<br><br>Second, television has made the culture of society monotonous. To put it in another way, it has devastated the diversity of culture in our society. Some people think through television, <del>the </del>globalization, which means the development of cultural diversity, has been achieved. However, it is totally wrong. In fact, this globalization through television has destroyed many valuable cultural inherits. Due to many television programs and advertisements, people not only buy one specific <mod target = goods>good</mod>, but also imitate <del>things</del> what they see. Especially, as most of the television programs are produced based on American society, people around the world have abandoned their own culture and adopted the style of America. For example, South Korean no longer <mod target = wear>wears</mod> their traditional clothes <mod target = and>nor</mod> <mod target = eat>eats</mod> their foods.

681&using cell phones should not be allowed when using public transportation.":::"Nowadays, a considerable number of people believe that people should not use cell phones when they use public <mod target = transprotation>transportation</mod>. However, I strongly maintain that using cell phones should be allowed when using public <mod target = transprotation>transportation</mod>. The fundamental reason behind this is that using cell phones <mod target = in>on</mod> public transportation makes people time-efficient and available to always <mod target = connet>connect</mod> <ins>with</ins> <mod target = people>others</mod>.<br>    <br>First of all, using cell phones <mod target = in>on</mod> public <mod target = transfortation>transportation</mod> helps people not to waste their precious time. The underlying reason behind this is that people do not waste their time moving to <mod target = other>another</mod> place by public transportation but can have various activities such as texting, calling, listening to music, and watching videos by <mod target = usung>using</mod> cell phones. According to my experience, I <mod target = go>went</mod> to <del>my</del> school by subway every morning. At that time, I <mod target = study>studied</mod> TOEFL listening using <ins>on my</ins> cell phone for 30 minutes.

However, this powerful <mod target = informative>information</mod> system also has brought us some serious problems. I agree with this perspective for a couple of reasons: children can easily approach <del>to</del> <mod target = violate>violent</mod> or sexual contents and many contents <mod target = from>on</mod> the Internet are not accurate.<br><br>First of all, people, especially children, <mod target = become more accessible>have more access</mod> to <del>the</del> information containing sexual and <mod target = violate>violent</mod> contents through the Internet. To be specific, in order to develop children's personality well, many parents prohibit their children from watching sexual or <mod target = violate>violent</mod> scenes when they are young. However, since the Internet, it becomes relatively easier for children to watch those contents at home. This can lead them to behave aggressively. For example, a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Education of Korea shows that the number of children <del>who</del> <mod target = have>having</mod> <del>ever</del> watched adult movies <mod target = are>constitute</mod> more than <mod target = two third>two-thirds</mod> of the population.

693&Students can get as many benefits from organization or club activities as they can get from academic studies.

However, nowadays, companies are very interested in hiring people who not only are able to collaborate with others, but also have a good relationship with other people, and these two things can be learned through activities in organization and clubs. Thus, I believe that organization and club activities are able to provide as many advantages as academic studies.<br> <br>To start with, club activities allow people to have <mod target = relationship>relationships</mod> with club members. As they frequently communicate with members, they are able to make friends with them. This brings a lot of benefits, especially while running a business. It makes <ins>it</ins> much more easier for people to get products that they need for business. This also <mod target = enable>enables</mod> people <ins>to</ins> know recent information. Besides, achieving contraction with friends would be much <del>more</del> easier than achieving it with people that you are not familiar with. When it comes to students, having a lot of friends enables them to borrow books that they might need and learn academical things that they didn't understand.

In real business, workers should work together in order to achieve goals that one cannot attain.

I<ins>,</ins> however, believe that it is not important to teach self-confidence <del>than to teach specialized knowledge</del>.

This result clearly shows that it is inefficient to teach self-confidence.<br> <br>Second, another reason for my thinking this way is that people can receive a lot of stress. It is difficult to have <mod target = self-conficence>self-confidence</mod>. Thus, it can be said <ins>that </ins>teaching specialized knowledge is better because teaching self-confidence is <ins>a</ins> hassle. A recent article I read <mod target = on>in</mod> the Korea Herald revealed some interesting findings. According to the article, a surprising number of people claimed that they had anxiety issues. I found it interesting because this was due to stress from <ins>the</ins> fact that they want to have self-confidence. Just last year, I could not go to sleep for 2 weeks because I was too stressed out from one person who has excessive self-confidence. He was a big problem in <ins>my</ins> company. As this outcome shows, teaching self-confidence is worse because people can receive a lot of stress.<br> <br>All things considered, with the <mod target = reason>reasons</mod> mentioned above, I believe that I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic.":::

Even if we don't <del>like to</del> enjoy working, we cannot but work to get something we want to have. <br><br>Second, we can improve our will power by doing things we do not enjoy doing.

558&Some people trust their first impressions about a person’s character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person’s character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Compare these two attitudes. Which attitude do you agree with? Support your choice with specific examples.":::"Many people tend to make judgments on one's character based on their first impression. This is a big mistake, though; evaluation on people's characters need to be done throughout time. This is because first impressions are based on how the people look on the outside only, and may not reveal their true personalities. <br><br>     First of all, making quick decisions on one's characteristics according to his or her <mod target = look>looks</mod> is highly likely to be erroneous. We have to take time and observe others to make <ins>up</ins> our mind on what kinds of people they are, as they may be different from what they seem to be. For example, I have a friend who looks pretty <mod target = gloom>gloomy</mod> on the outside. At first, I assumed  that she must be very quiet and calm. However, in the three years I have known her, talking and seeing her, I have found out that she is one talkative, and even rather hyper, girl. <br><br>     Secondly, first impressions mostly do not reveal one's real characteristics. For one thing, first impressions vary depending on people's moods, and it may lead you to make a wrong judgment. A person could be depressed at the particular time you first encountered him, even though he is <del>a </del>very bright in general occasions. Moreover, there are people who are not very skilled at expressing <mod target = them>themselves</mod>.

560&The second reading of a book is more interesting than the first reading.":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not the second reading of a book is more interesting than the first reading. The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that the first reading of a book <del>and reading various books</del> is more interesting and advantageous. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, it allows one to broaden view of life. Second, the second reading of a book is not good for one's health.<br><br> <br><br>           To begin with, the first reading of a book <del>and reading various books</del> enables one to widen <ins>a</ins> view of life. This is attributed to the fact that reading a lot of books <mod target = at>for</mod> <ins>the</ins> first time will expose one to different worlds of life styles, basic customs, and cultures from various contexts of books, and he or she can be familiarized with and embrace other cultures and people. Thus, one can make different friends with different backgrounds, which helps one to reduce prejudice and be open-minded toward strangers. For example, there <mod target = had been>was</mod> a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if reading books just <mod target = first time>once</mod> is good for readers. Of all, 78.1 percent of them stated that it is effective for them because they can read lots of books without the second reading and gain various experience indirectly, leading to broaden their perspectives. For this reason, the Seoul National University in Korea recommends their students to read books <ins>once</ins> <del>first time and various books</del>. Therefore, the first reading is more interesting than the second reading <del>of a book</del> as it helps readers to widen <mod target = view>views</mod> <mod target = of>in</mod> their <mod target = life>lives</mod>.<br><br> <br><br>           In addition, the second reading of a book is detrimental to one's health. This is due to the fact that readers become stressed out when trying to understand the contents of books, and stress is one of the main factors of diseases through weakening the immune system. Thus, readers are likely to be weaker when dealing with <del>the </del>challenges. According to an article, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor<ins>,</ins> claimed: “People do not need to read books at several times in order to understand the contents of books. This is because as they have to try to understand the whole meaning of <mod target = connection>connections</mod> of sentences, words, and paragraphs in books in order to understand entire contents of books, it is likely that readers <ins>will</ins> become stressed out. However, reading books is for being happy, obtaining information, and making one's mental health good. For this reason, people have to avoid reading books <del>at </del>several times.” Thus, the second reading of a book is not effective for people since they easily become stressed out when dealing with difficulties.<br><br> <br><br>           In <mod target = conclusion,I>conclusion, I</mod> strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above.

The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that employing cell phones in transportation is useful. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, it helps one to relieve stress. Second, it improves work efficiency.<br><br> <br><br>           To begin with, using mobile phones when <del>people </del><mod target = use>using</mod> public transportation can significantly reduce their stress level. This is attributed to the fact that when people have problems about loud noise from others, playing <ins>a</ins> game <mod target = by>on</mod> cell phones distract them from worries and stress. This simple and quick escape from stress may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. For example, <del>there had been</del> a study conducted by <del>the</del> Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if using mobile phones <mod target = in>on</mod> <ins>the</ins> subway is effective.

For this reason, utilizing cell phones <mod target = in>on</mod> <ins>public</ins> transportation is advantageous for people as they can relieve their stress.<br><br> <br><br>                             In addition, using <mod target = cellphones>cell phones</mod> <mod target = in>on</mod> public transportation enhances work efficiency.

Second, there are already good materials to help students to focus on their <mod target = study>studies</mod>.<br> <br>First of all, <del>doing </del>research plays a key role in developing our society to <ins>be a</ins> better place to live.

There is no big difference from sitting face to face. These kinds of sites are very useful to communicate with friends. If I want to give a friend a message immediately, but the friend cannot take a message, I post on <mod target = the>their</mod> site. To me, communicating by SNS has no prominent difference from sitting face to face. These kinds of SNS are very useful to communicate with friends. Moreover, people can contact and build digital relationships with celebrities who are hard to meet for real. Lots of famous people such as politicians, actors or musicians leave messages on Twitter or Facebook. They have millions of followers and they share feelings and communicate. A fan can chat one-on-one and a celebrity becomes closer and interacts individually with them.<br>     <br>To sum up, there are positive effects in using social media. It is not only that people listen to information happening all over the world, but they can have good relationships with the world people as well. In this regard, social sites are greatly worthwhile to people in terms of sharing information and interacting. Social media sites will increasingly improve and the number of users will grow.":::

However, as far as trustworthy is concerned, I strongly claim that watching news TV programs is the best way to get more conceivable knowledge.

598&People have fewer fields that they are skilled at because they do many activities.":::"There has been heated debate whether people have fewer fields of expertise as they do various activities. Some people may believe this is true while others deem otherwise. However, I believe that participating <ins>in</ins> various fields of work will enable individual to earn further skills. This is not only because learners will obtain <ins>a wide</ins> variety of knowledge from the activities<ins>,</ins> but also because they can meet new friends from different fields. In this manner<ins>,</ins> I go against the statement above.<br><br>   The first reason for my opinion is that experiencing many <mod target = works>jobs</mod> will provide opportunities for people to learn numerous skills. In this heavily competitive world, students do various <mod target = works>tasks</mod>. Starting from <mod target = part time>part-time</mod> <mod target = job>jobs</mod> at <mod target = cafe>cafes</mod> to volunteer work, they gain <mod target = many>a lot of</mod> experience from various areas.

At social clubs<ins>,</ins> I was taught how to play <ins>the</ins> trumpet and how to work <mod target = in>on</mod> a team. This example illustrates how we can gain more skills by doing many activities.<br> <br>Another reason for my argument is that individuals can make new friends who can teach us new skills. Though participating <ins>in</ins> numerous activities do deter people to only concentrate one specific area, it is beneficial to acquire new friends. Getting <mod target = acquisition>acquainted</mod> with new people is favorable. This can lead <mod target = individual>individuals</mod> to learn new fields which they are now sure about. In addition, through the new friends<ins>,</ins> people may have <ins>a</ins> chance to work in new fields as well. To be more specific, according to <mod target = the>a</mod> recent survey <del>done</del> <mod target = by>from</mod> Seoul National University<ins>,</ins> <del>it shows that</del> people believe meeting new friends <mod target = can make>allows</mod> us to obtain new abilities.

Also<ins>,</ins> <del>while</del> talking to new people from different areas <del>it</del><del></del><del></del> can broaden <ins>an</ins> <mod target = individuals>individual's</mod> view. This case proves how acquiring new friends can facilitate us to think <mod target = broader>more broadly</mod> and gain new skills.<br> <br>Subsequent to mulling over this query,  I disagree with the statement given above. The more work people experience from new fields<ins>, the</ins> more capabilities they will earn.

600&People learn more by watching television than by reading books.":::"An ongoing debate exists whether learning by watching television is more helpful than learning by reading books. Regarding this controversial issue, I firmly believe that people are more likely to learn better through <del>the </del>visual materials such as television rather than written materials like books. The reasoning behind this is that learning by watching television enhances the possibility to remember. Additionally, people achieve <del>some</del> knowledge more easily by watching television than by reading books. <br><br>First of all, people can remember what they see <mod target = in>on</mod> <del>the</del> television better. This is because when <del>the</del> visual materials are created, producers strive to make it more vivid and effective to stimulate people's imagination. They take all kinds of measures for upgrading both visual and hearing <mod target = effect>effects</mod> to convey their messages. According to <mod target = the>a</mod> report released by the National Education Institute <mod target = in>of</mod> Korea, students who study using television lectures of all subjects perform better than those who study <ins>while</ins> focusing on <del>their</del> reading material <del>for themselves</del>. <mod target = It>The report</mod> also adds that students state that they can easily recall what they see <mod target = in>on</mod> television <ins>more</ins> than those who just read <del>the</del> books.

Some people argue that reading books makes students get into the discussion which is the best way to make profound reasoning.

In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. However, I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.<br><br>For starters, good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees<mod target =  promote>excel</mod> faster and that is what they do in their position at work.

Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world.

Carbon emissions from cars and other human activities are largely responsible for global warming. Various measures are being taken by governments to handle this problem.

Governments ask people to use subways and buses on their <mod target = way to home and work>daily commute </mod>rather than driving their own cars.

As such, people on modern society should actively find the ways to reduce their stress and stay healthy. Students can do this when they are released from <del>the</del> school. When I was young, school time was really stressful because I had to stay <mod target = ahead>late</mod> and absorb information without rest.

In other words, classrooms in school are some kind of closed society. Students' views are limited because they always meet <strong>the </strong>same people.

As modern society is becoming increasingly globalized, today's world requires people with a strong understand<strong>ing</strong> of international view<strong>s</strong>.

To illustrate, Steven Jobs<strong>,</strong> who is the founder of Apple Company<strong>,</strong> made great accomplishments in his life<del> </del>time. I read online that he was really successful because he was global<strong>ly</strong>-minded and culturally sensitive.  He did this by going outside, meeting different people, <strong>and </strong>traveling <strong>to</strong> other <mod target = country>countries</mod>. In other words, he enjoyed his leisure time outside the school or company. Thus, it is <mod target = legitimated>safe</mod> to say that students should have their own time that can be used outside the campus.<br><br>All things considered, <mod target = It>it</mod> is my belief that my argument regarding<del> to</del> this topic is effectively and precisely delivered with <strong>the </strong>reasons mentioned above.

""23&We should let children realize their faults and mistakes on their own.

In this essay, I will present two reasons to support my idea.<br><br>To begin with, with children having little experience, they are not capable of <mod target = discriminating>discerning</mod> the good from the bad. Specifically, children are no more than ten years old, which shows that they have spent little time accumulating valuable experiences that can make them learn how to <mod target = expect>control</mod> their behaviors. They do not understand <mod target = the entire>entirely the</mod> things that surround them and are not sensible <strong>enough</strong> to recognize their faults<del> before they had the same experience but was not given the right directions to correct the wrong</del>.

In this regard, children really need adults' help regardless of difficulty and importance.<br><br>On top of that, children are surrounded by<del> the </del>real threats, which might have critical effects on their lives. To be specific, many people agree that it is effective for children to learn how to solve the problems they encounter.

No one can make sure that <mod target = merely>only</mod> little accidents happen <mod target = to>in</mod> children's lives. According to <del>the</del> recent studies by one prominent university, there are <del>so</del> many children taken to the emergency room <del>in hospital </del>for some accidents.

26&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to watch serious movies that are designed to make you think than to watch movies that are primarily designed to amuse or entertain.":::"For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 6<ins>,</ins>000 years, sources of entertainment <mod target = has>have</mod> always existed. Nowadays, watching movies is the most popular way of spending free time. There are largely two genres of movies: comedy movies, and serious movies. Some may argue that the movies primarily designed to amuse or entertain people are better. Nevertheless, serious movies are more preferable to most of the people for two reasons: they make people ponder <del>about</del> social issues<del>,</del> and contain the director's life experiences and wisdom that are worth <mod target = spreading>sharing</mod>.<br><br>To begin with, serious movies help people to think about <del>the</del> social issues, which <ins>are</ins> <del>they</del> rarely discuss<ins>ed</ins> <del>about</del>. There certain problems of <del>the</del> society which are uncomfortable to talk about with friends or co-workers, such as capital punishment, selfish human nature, or sexual crimes. Yet, serious movies often deal with the social issues that are touchy. For example,<ins> the</ins> Batman series<mod target = :>,</mod> Batman begins, <ins>the</ins> Dark knight, and <ins>the</ins> Dark knight returns, directed by Christopher Nolan, is about the hero who saves the city, but only receive<ins>s </ins>blame<del>s </del>from the citizens and <ins>is</ins> considered <mod target = as>to be a</mod> convict.

If it were not for the <mod target = b>B</mod>atman series, he would be still <ins>be</ins> ignorant <mod target = with>to</mod> the problems of our society.<br><br>On top of that, the director's life experiences and knowledge <del>that</del> are <mod target = worth spreading>shared</mod> <del>are comprised</del> in serious movies. Living in <mod target = the>a</mod> world with<del> the</del> overflowing information requires<del>,</del> indirect experiences<del>, </del>in order to learn everything. Therefore, people often read to gain knowledge that is summarized or organized by other people.

Sadly, not all <del>the</del> genres of movies can do <mod target = the>this</mod> <del>jobs</del>. Especially, humorous movies cannot <mod target = covey>convey</mod> any thoughts or experiences, because their primary job is to amuse and arouse laughter from people.

Even with <del>the</del> <mod target = descriptions>explanations</mod> <ins>of how the problem is solved</ins> <del>of the problem</del>, students occasionally do not understand why the answer is related to the problem. Thus, it <mod target = leads to>takes</mod> <ins>a </ins>considerable time for students to grasp <ins>concepts</ins>. However, if students study with a teacher, this time issue can be settled. According to my firsthand experience, I once had a difficult time when solving math problems by myself, and wasted a significant amount of time to find solutions. Nevertheless, I found a tutor who can give me <del>a</del> right solutions with <del>a</del> very detailed steps. <del>Hence,</del> I could understand the subject to the fullest and <mod target = step>move</mod> onto <mod target = the next>subsequent</mod> material much faster<ins>, </ins>which paved the way for me to gain more knowledge.<br><br>Second, study<ins>ing</ins> with a teacher is also an effective way to learn since teachers give <del>out the</del> appropriate assessment to students. <del>That is, </del><ins>B</ins>y letting students <del>to</del> realize what <del>is</del> their weak point<ins>s</ins> <ins>are</ins> on the material, they can enhance their overall grades.

Of course, it depends largely on the characteristics of work, with some work accomplished easily with a group of members, <del>otherwise</del> <ins>and other work</ins> achieved easily alone.

Of course, there are few jobs that we can achieve alone, but when the job is well<ins>-</ins>distributed to people independently, this <mod target = would>will </mod>eventually save time dramatically. In this case, members should know their specific role<ins>s</ins> in a job. Once a person <mod target = exactly knows>knows exactly</mod> what he <ins>or she </ins>should do for the job, he <ins>or she </ins>can schedule and plan <del>about </del>the steps of the job with <mod target = comfortable mind>ease </mod>rather than <del>interfered by others such as supervisors</del> <ins>having others, such as supervisors, interfere</ins>. According to a survey, one student <mod target = got>received</mod> a higher score when studying alone<del>, with concentration on what he had learned, </del>than others who <mod target = study>studied</mod> with others.

Although group members can help what someone is doing, independent job<ins>s</ins> make a person finish the job efficiently in <ins>a </ins>comfortable atmosphere.<br><br>Second<ins>ly</ins>, since it is difficult to <ins>thoroughly</ins> know <del>entirely</del> about group members<ins>, </ins>such as <ins>the</ins> personality of a person, we can <mod target = get>run into</mod> some trouble when we work with others.

For the following two reasons, I firmly believe that concentrating on one skill is better than studying a variety of skills<mod target = .> :</mod> <ins>It allows people </ins>to develop <ins>a </ins><mod target = specialty>speicialty</mod> and <del>to </del>increase children's academic performance<ins>s</ins>.<br> <br>To begin with, focusing on one skill enables people to enhance their <mod target = specialties>specialty</mod>. This is due to the fact that when people spend most of their time studying their major, they can develop <ins>an </ins>expertise<ins>.</ins> Moreover, as modern society is becoming increasingly competitive and specialized, today's job markets require job candidates with such qualities. For example, according to a study done by the New York Times in 2010, it <ins>was </ins>revealed that the employee interview was the most important <mod target = part of the>in</mod> hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call. The study indicated that the interviewers looked at the applicant's knowledge and skills, mostly related to specialty. Thus, this proves that specialization is a good and safe way for children to prepare for their future<ins>s</ins>.<br> <br>Furthermore, concentrating on one skill encourages students to perform with more ent<ins>h</ins>usiasm. This is attributed to the fact that studying one skill lowers their stress level<ins>s</ins>, which serves as one of the key motivators for them to perform better and <mod target = improve>inprove</mod> themselves. Moreover, they can put in <del>their </del>effort, concentrate better on their work, and feel more responsible for their tasks. For instance, according to a study conduc<del>e</del>ted by the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2009, it <ins>was </ins>revealed that there was a huge difference between two groups of students in achievement. Students in Group A spent more hours studying their major<ins>s</ins> and  those in Group B spent most of their time studying different skills. The study indicated that the former group performed higher than the latter group. Not only that, <ins>but </ins>students in Group A <ins>also </ins>followed instructions, submitted assignments on time, <ins>and </ins>participated actively in group meetings. On the other hand, those in Group B lazed off in class and lacked focus on class materials because studying different skills stressed them out. Therefore, this shows that concentrating on one skill allows children to <mod target = improve>increase</mod> their academic performance.":::

602&It is sometimes acceptable to infringe upon people's freedom.":::"In terms of the statement that controlling people's freedom is sometimes necessary, I would like to talk about two advantages, especially in the view of <ins>a </ins>national system.

In addition, infringing people's freedom is necessary to develop the economy of a nation.<br> <br>To begin with, when a nation is in a dangerous situation, controlling people's freedom is more effective and fast to solve the problem.

First, there exists a maximum limit for getting <ins>the </ins>best result<ins>s</ins> when gathering information <mod target = to solve>for solving</mod> problems.

However, I believe that <mod target = beneficial>benefits </mod>of books outweigh <mod target = the>those of the </mod>TV<del>s</del>. This is not only because books deliver<del>s</del> information with detail but because TV is produced basically for entertainment not for education. Likewise<ins>,</ins> I go against the statement above.<br>    <br>The first reason for my opinion is that books deal <ins>with </ins>the information in detail. Though some people may claim TV also does describe facts along with the sound effect and visual aid, TV program<ins>s</ins> actually omit a lot of information. For instance, <mod target = compare>comparing </mod><del>to </del>the books<mod target = ,>to the</mod> movie<ins>s</ins> Harry Potter does seem to skip some of <ins>the</ins> part<ins>s</ins>. As the running time is limited to 2 to 3 hours, it is not possible to play everything that was depicted at the book. All the details which illustrate how  Harry Potter uses <ins>his</ins> magic wand and how he fly<ins>s</ins> with <mod target = its>his </mod>magic broom<del>s</del> helps readers to imagine and learn all the marvelous vocabulary. However, such scene on the TV is just <ins>a </ins>very small tiny part of the book which does not really help the viewers. For this reason<ins>,</ins> I think that TV is not <mod target = much>very </mod>helpful for learning <mod target = than>compared to </mod><del>the </del>books.<br> <br>    Another reason for my argument is that TV program<ins>s</ins> <mod target = is>are </mod>made for fun<ins>,</ins> not for education<ins>al</ins> purpose<ins>s</ins>. Numerous TV programs are filmed and played day to day. However, as TV broadcasts are mostly relying on their proceeds from <del>the </del>advertisement<ins>s</ins> and commercial<ins>s,</ins> they have to produce programs that are eye catching. This means whether it is helpful in giving knowledgeable information, <mod target = PDs>producers </mod>and directors have to primarily consider how <mod target = it>they </mod>can draw as much attraction as possible.

Therefore, I disagree <mod target = with>to</mod> the statement that attending a live performance (for example, a play concert, or sporting event) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television because of two reasons; health and money.<br><br>To begin with, attending a live performance could be harmful to our health.

Although this can enable everyone, even <del>to </del>the people in the very back, to hear their performances, it could be harmful <mod target = to>for</mod> people who are standing right next to the speakers. Also, in performances where a lot of excited fans are eager to get closer to the performers, the fans that are standing right at the front may be in danger of getting their internal organs damaged due to the pressure.

As soon as I arrived at the concert hall, there were thousands of fans screaming and pushing to see Justin Bieber sing.

Generally in concert halls, the closer we are to the performers, the more expensive it is to watch.  Therefore, if people buy seats that are quite far away in order to save money, they cannot enjoy the show as much since it is hard<ins>er</ins> to watch the performers in detail.  However, by watching the show on television, we can see the performers in a more detailed way, since the cameras try to capture the performers in detail, and it does not have to cost us that much money.

In <del>the </del>today's globalized society, it is widely believed that technology designed to make people's lives simper often turns out to make <mod target = them>toem</mod> more complicated. Some people advocate that technology can stress people out. However, I disagree with this point. For the following two reasons, I firmly believe that <ins>the </ins>development of technology makes people's <mod target = lives>life</mod> <ins>more</ins> comfortable<del> </del>: <mod target = it>to</mod> broaden<ins>s</ins> their perspectives and <mod target = helps them>to</mod> perform with more enthusiasm.<br> <br>To begin with, <ins>the </ins>development of technology enables people to widen their horizon<ins>s</ins>. This is due to the fact that technology, such as computers and cell-phones, can expose people to different worlds of lifestyles, basic customs, and cultures. Through such experience<ins>s</ins>, they can learn to embrace diversity. This is especially important given that modern society is becoming increasingly globalized. For example, when I went to a park with my father, there was an Ethiopian girl who brought home-cooked meals for lunch. It smelled strange and she even ate with her hands without a fork. Alt<ins>h</ins>ough my father<ins>,</ins> who had never seen such behavior<ins>,</ins> kept his distance from her, I felt comfortable with it. This was because I learned and knew about such behavior <mod target = from>by</mod> using my computers. Thus, this shows that <ins>the </ins>development of technology allows people to broaden their perspectives.<br> <br>Furthermore, technology encourages children to increase their academic performance. This is attributed to the fact that people can get all the information with one<mod target =  >-</mod>mouse click, which serves as one of the key motivators for students to perform better and improve<del>s</del> themselves. With such motiva<ins>t</ins>ion, they can put in their effort, concentrate better on their tasks, and feel more responsible for their work. For instance, according <mod target = to>ot</mod> a study done by the New York Times in 2010, it <ins>was </ins>revealed that there was a huge difference between two <mod target = groups>gorups</mod> of students in achievement. Students in Group A spent many hours using a computer in order to get <ins>the </ins>information they needed and those in Group B spent more time reading their text<del> </del>books. The study indicated that the former group performed higher and <mod target = got>get</mod> better grades than the latter group. Moreover, students in Group A followed instructions,  submitted their assignments, and participated actively in group meetings. On the other hand, those in Group B lazed off in class and lacked focus on class materials. Thus, this proves that <mod target = technology enables>techonology enalbes</mod> students to perform with more enthusiasm.<br> <br>All things considered, it is my belief that my argument regarding this topic has been precisely and effectively delivered with the reasons mentioned above.

I strongly believe the fast<ins> </ins>food<del>s</del> and cooking food more easily harm<ins>s</ins> us more than help<ins>s</ins> us. It's because fast<ins> </ins>food<del>s</del> can cause health problems and cooking food easily takes away the pleasure of cooking one's own food. <br><br>To begin with, fast<ins> </ins>food<del>s</del> can eas<ins>i</ins>ly be the <mod target = cause>causation</mod> of health problem<ins>s</ins>. This is mainly because of the <mod target = high>higl</mod> calories that fast<ins> </ins>food<del>s</del> contain<ins>s</ins>.

In this manner, youth cannot afford <del>the </del>time for their <mod target = communities>community</mod>.<br>   <br>Another reason for my argument is that young people do not think it is essential to aid the community. Though it might be common <mod target = courtesy>courteous</mod> for everyone in <del>the </del>town to work together when they face any <del>of </del>issue, not everyone, especially young people<ins>,</ins> <del>do not much </del>care<ins> much</ins>.

620&Professors should focus on research more than teaching student.":::"Different people have different opinions about the statement that professors should <mod target = be more concentrated>concentrate more</mod> on <del>the </del>research than teaching students.

For that reason, professors should do their best in teaching students with sincerity.

Using smartphone<ins>s</ins>, <ins>the </ins>internet<ins>,</ins> and email<ins>s</ins><del>,</del> they are able to <mod target = contact>connect</mod> with students more closely than ever before.  For example, I joined the class in which the professor mainly uses <mod target = the>a </mod>smartphone <mod target = on>in </mod>the lecture. He turned on the computer and projector in <mod target = a>the </mod>classroom and used his own smartphone and linked them through the Bluetooth. The class was about the history of economics, he projected a sort of graphs and data immediately and quoted many images whenever the students had a hard time <mod target = to understand>understanding</mod> the topic. So<ins>,</ins> we <del>are </del>easily figured out the various concept<ins>s</ins> of <del>the </del>economics and felt <ins>that </ins>the class is more enjoyable.<br>                   <br>On top of that, students are <ins>the</ins> same as customers and they are eligible to <mod target = require>a </mod>certain quality of <del>the </del>lecture. As we know, tuition fee<ins>s</ins> <mod target = is>are </mod>not <mod target = much low>cheap</mod> and <ins>the</ins> lecture quality is the most considerable part of choosing the class for students.  For instance, one survey conducted by <mod target = a>the </mod>Korean National Institution for Education has shown that 63% of the university students<ins>'</ins> response<ins>s say</ins> they are not satisfied with their lectures.

A survey also represent that when students required to choose the question <mod target = that>about what </mod>the most dissatisfying thing in the lecture<ins> is</ins>, they <mod target = response>respond that it's </mod>the old-fashioned material in the class. <mod target = Not>It's not </mod>all the classes, but some of <del>that </del>still use outdated case<ins>s</ins>, examples, <ins>and </ins>uncorrected material.

Some people advocate that planning carefully prevents people from broadening their perspectives. However, I disagree with this point. For the following two reasons, I firmly believe that planning carefully is a better way to solve <del>the </del>problems than being creative: to improve a sense of responsibility and to promote work efficiency.<br> <br>To begin with, planning carefully encourages people to improve <mod target = their>a</mod> sense of responsibility. This is due to the fact that planning requires many obligations, such as manag<del>n</del>ing their schedules<del> widely</del>, abiding by rules, <ins>and </ins>cooperating with other members. Through the consequences arising from negligent actions, people can learn the importance of obligation. For example, my youngest brother<del> </del>,<ins> </ins>who was the <mod target = president>present</mod> of a sport<ins>s</ins> club in his college, used to be lazy and se<ins>l</ins>fish.

This is attributed to the fact that having careful<ins>ly made</ins> plan<ins>s</ins> help people feel confidence because they <mod target = won't>don't</mod> feel fear. Having confidence can serve as  one of the key motivators for them to perform better and <del>to </del>improve themselves.

The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on <del>the </del>individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that governments should preserve wild animals and wilderness places for <del>the </del>future generation<ins>s</ins>. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, by doing it, people release their stress<del> level</del>. Second, it helps them succeed in their <mod target = lives>life</mod>.<br><br>           To begin with, visiting wilderness places significantly reduce<ins>s</ins> one's stress<del> level</del>. This is attributed to the fact that watching wild animals and natures distracts one from worries and anxiety. Thus, this simple and quick escape from <del>the </del>reality may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. For example, there had been a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea.

Thus, governments <mod target = should>have to</mod> spend their budget on protecting wilderness places because their citizen<ins>s</ins> can stay healthy without stress.<br><br>            In addition, being educated about the importance of <ins>the </ins>preservation of wilderness places from an early age has a direct <mod target = correlation>correlated</mod> to success in life.

629&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answers.":::"People's thoughts about this statement can vary. However, I agree with this statement that parents are the best teachers because parents spend more time with their children and parents are people who know their children the best.<br>            <br>First of all, since parents spend more time with their children, children are easily influenced by their parents' lifestyle<ins>s</ins>. In fact, children only spend six or seven hours a day at school and the rest of <ins>their </ins>time at home with their parents. In other words, children learn more from their parents' daily routine<ins>s</ins> such as how they talk each other, how they greet other people<ins>,</ins> <del>and </del>how they eat etc. One day, I watched a TV program about students who are accepted into <ins>the </ins>Ivy League. A common habit they have <mod target = is>was</mod> they love reading various books. They said that they used to spend time with their parents in the library and discuss issues from books <mod target = that>what</mod> they read. Their parents also read a lot of books at home instead of watching TV so that <ins>their </ins>children can be influenced by looking at their parents' lifestyle<ins>s</ins>.<br>            <br>In add<ins>i</ins>tion, parents are people who know their children best; therefore, they know how to motivate their children. Parents <mod target = knew>know</mod> their children since they were born, while teachers have many children to take care of in a class and children do not always have <ins>the </ins>same teachers every year. Therefore, parents know their children better <mod target = in regards to>about</mod> what their children's strengths and weaknesses are. <mod target = The best>Best</mod> example is my mother.

Yet, I personally believe traveling with a companion has better advantages than traveling alone because the more people you have<ins> with you</ins>, <ins>t</ins>he more information you <ins>will </ins>have <mod target = about>in</mod> the touring scene and environment. Not only that but also you can reduce the travel<del>ing</del> expenses in various ways. These two factors are crucial in determining what a suc<ins>c</ins>essful trip is, thus the following ex<del>c</del>amples and explanations will help your understanding.<br>  <br>First, going <mod target = to>on</mod> a whole new and unfamiliar area is an adventurous challenge, even <mod target = if>though</mod> the place <mod target = was>is</mod> made suitable for foreign tourists. Language barriers, cultural differences, <ins>and </ins>pharmaceutical and food issues are just the few matters that we have to mediate with. If you were all alone in such a location with so <mod target = many>much</mod> demand<ins>s</ins>, you will have less time and resources to enjoy what you have planned for<del>,</del> in the first place. However, if you're accompanied <mod target = by a>with</mod> few others, you'll have a much bigger chance to solve <del>out </del>these problems<del> easier</del>. For example, I went on a trip to Turkey with my college friends last summer, and despite preparing for the trip for a long time, none of us were <del>able to be </del>fluent in <ins>the </ins>Turkish language.  Starting from the first day of <ins>our </ins>arrival, we struggled to communicate with the locals<del>,</del> and had a hard time finding our <mod target = hotel>Hotel</mod>, but were able to minimize the confusion by gathering our heads together with our individual information and ideas. One of my friend used frequently used Turkish words to explain our destination, while the other used <ins>a </ins>map and body language to express our needs. It was <del>a </del>terrific team<del> </del>work and the locals had little problem understanding us. Were it not for the team work, I would not have <del>had </del>found a place to stay for the whole day.<br>   <br>Also, traveling with companions is an effective means to reduce one's traveling expenses. Many of the tourist locations offer discounts to group<ins>s</ins> of visitors. It has been announced in the annual report from the Ministry of culture and tourism<del>,</del> that 95% of major tourist locations around the world implement group discou<ins>n</ins>t policies to attract more visitors. This also applies to rest<ins>au</ins>ra<del>u</del>nts and s<ins>o</ins>uveni<del>o</del>r shops or <mod target = theater>Theater</mod> ticket purchase<del>ment</del>s.

""718&When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some prefer to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person. Which way do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.""":::"There are two ways of complaining about a defective product or poor service. Some people prefer to write a letter to a clerk and others prefer to talk about <ins>their </ins>dissatisfaction directly. At a glance, though, the disadvantages such as the volatility of <mod target = a>one's</mod> proof and the aggravation of the situation by impulsive action are really discouraging. However, I believe that the advantages of the latter outweigh its disadvantages by far. In this essay, I will demonstrate some reasons why supporting the latter is reasonable and justifiable. <br><br>Firstly, you can get quicker service when you complain in person. A letter takes time to go through the mail and to be answered by someone. However, if you complain in person, you can go back to the store whenever you want and you usually get someone to help you as you wait. For this reason, this is a better use of your time. Let me offer an example<mod target = ,>.</mod> I had sent <ins>a company </ins>my pants and a letter written <ins>with </ins>some <mod target = complains>complaints</mod> when my pants <del>was</del> <mod target = shrink>shrank</mod> after washing. At that time I had to wait to change the pants <mod target = during>for</mod> one month. <br><br>Furthermore, if you complain in person, you can explain yourself more clearly. On the other hand, if you writer a letter, you cannot be as clear as you can in person. As the Korean proverb<mod target =  say>says</mod>, one<mod target =  facing>meeting</mod> is better than one hundred letters. This means that the best way to make <mod target = understand someone>someone understand</mod> is talking in person <del>except to writing</del>. We cannot read any emotion <mod target = and>or</mod> gesture of the other party through <mod target = the>a</mod> letter because it has no <mod target = eye and lip>eyes or lips</mod>. Sometimes this weak point <mod target = makes>creates</mod> a lot of mistakes. Therefore, I <mod target = support>believe</mod> that a dialogue is easier to understand <del>mutual opinion</del> than a letter. <br><br>In conclusion, complaining is never fun.

Some people say that it is more important for students to study history and literature and other people say that to study science and mathematics <del>it</del> is more important<del> for them</del>.

The interesting fact is that from young children to the old, no one can even think about sightseeing <mod target = at>in</mod> my town without visiting museums.

That's why many schools are trying to <mod target = take>make</mod> visiting museums <del>as</del> <mod target = a>an</mod> essential part in <del>the course of</del> history class.

Parents are human. Thus, they can be tempremental. They might sometimes have emotional <mod target = explosion>explosions</mod> if their children do not listen to <mod target = him>them</mod>. They may use abusive words to their children or even beat them. We've seen some parents who beat their own kids.

In general, a family needs a lot of money to spend: buying essential commodities, paying housing rent and so on. If the <mod target = parent>parents</mod> do not earn much money and their children have to work for money, their lives, especially the children' lives<ins>,</ins> will become miserable.

However, in spite of all these benefits, for young children, emotional development is more important than increasing knowledge from books. Most character is built when people are young. Therefore, it is important what young children see, hear and experience. Unfortunately, in Korea, so many parents force their children to study from when they are so young. Parents believe that if their children learn something at a school, they will succeed when they grow up. Some children have no time to play with their friends.

846&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)?

However, unless he endures <mod target = the>these</mod> hard times, he will not become a successful cobbler <mod target = as well as>or</mod> a man of noble character. <br><br>On the other hand, people's curiosity about a certain job urges them to stick to the job. No one <ins>can </ins>deny the fact that a person has an inclination about some fields. <mod target = So do I>I do</mod>.

933&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should wait to begin learning a foreign language until they start school.

In this situation, we can say knowing a foreign language is the most important and strong<ins>est</ins> weapon in this society. I, however, believe children should not begin learning a foreign language until they start school for <mod target = some>a few</mod> reasons.<br><br>First of all, learning <ins>their </ins>first language is more important for children because it provides a basic understanding of a language.

In this way, they would <mod target = feel easier>have an easier time</mod> when they start learning a second language at school. For example, <del>A </del>student <ins>A </ins>felt more confident <mod target = on>about their</mod> second language before going to school while <del>B </del>student <ins>B </ins>did not. After <ins>the </ins>first semester, <del>B </del>student <ins>B </ins>got better result<ins>s</ins> <mod target = on>in</mod> Spanish class than <mod target = result A student had>student A</mod>.

938&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Exams encourage students to learn.":::"Some people maintain that exams are unnecessary, as it only causes stress. In this sense, a few schools already discarded <ins>their </ins><mod target = policy>policies</mod> to <mod target = take>administer</mod> <del>a </del>test<ins>s</ins>. However, I disagree with this statement and believe exams encourage students to learn. My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below. <br><br>To start with, exams motivate students to learn as it gives students <mod target = the>an</mod> arranged amount <mod target = of>to</mod> study until the scheduled date.  In other words, exams induce students to look back <mod target = at>on</mod> their books which <mod target = would be out of their eyes>they would not look at</mod> if it were not for the exams. No test<ins>s</ins> makes students <mod target = loose>slack off</mod>, since they think they all know about the content<del>s,</del> just because they had the class before and it dis<del>en</del>courages them <mod target = to>from</mod> study<ins>ing</ins>. For instance, I was in a high school where the policy was to not <mod target = to take a>give</mod> test<ins>s</ins> to relieve <ins>the </ins>stress of students. It really had an impact <mod target = for>on</mod> students including me, and I didn't study at all. I didn't have any incentive to <del>do </del>study. In contrast, after realizing that students' intellectual <mod target = ability is going down>abilities were declining</mod>, the school modified the policy to <mod target = take>give</mod> a test every semester. Then students initiated studying, also accepting the evaluation that their ability <mod target = was>had</mod> deteriorated. <br><br>On top of that, exams foster competence among<del>st</del> students which would encourage students to study.  To put it another way, students care about the test score<ins>s</ins> and their rivals. Thus, when a student see<ins>s</ins> that his or her rival <ins>is </ins>studying in <ins>their </ins>free time, it is likely that the student would also study<del>,</del> <ins>and </ins>not to <del>be </del>loiter<del>ed</del>. An analogous example studied in Seoul<del>d</del> National University shows this precisely. In <ins>a </ins>marathon, runners tend to form <ins>separate </ins>groups<ins>,</ins> <del>sepereately </del>and the groups make runners <del>to </del>keep up with their rivals.

Thus, their self-respect could be hurt <mod target = according to>because of</mod> the result.

In conclusion<ins>,</ins> the extinction of species, whether carnivore<ins>s</ins> or herbivore<ins>s</ins>, from <mod target = human's>humans'</mod> relentless land use will bring <mod target = whole>complete</mod> destruction <mod target = in>to</mod> nature including human<ins>s</ins> themselves. <br><br>On top of that, land use for only humans will pollute the land which will make <ins>the </ins>land <mod target = cannot be used>unusable</mod> for decades.

To illustrate this point, most parents demand that students should only concentrate on their <mod target = study>studies</mod>. In other words, they could not <del>have to </del>do anything if it is <mod target = needless not>not required</mod> to enter college.

In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? Use specific reasons and example to support your answer.""":::"As books have provided much knowledge and skill, it is no exaggeration that books play a pivotal role in developing human society. Of course, knowledge gained from books has many advantageous aspects. It is easy to be delivered from people to people, because it has already been modified for the purpose of transmission. We can agree that the primary reason of writing a book is to transfer its content to readers and make them understood. In addition, knowledge gained from books is <mod target = a>an</mod> efficient and effective <ins>way</ins> to learn many things within a short period of time. For instance, just <mod target = for>in</mod> a couple of days, people can learn many aspects about Japan even if they do not visit <del>it</del>. <br><br>However, I firmly believe that knowledge gained from experience is more important than <del>one </del>from books based on two reasons addressed below. First and foremost, knowledge gained from experience lasts for a longer time. In other words, those who possess experienced knowledge are more likely to memorize and use it longer and <ins>more</ins> frequently than those who <mod target = depends>depend</mod> on codified knowledge only. This is because people remember and use knowledge not only by using <ins>their </ins><mod target = brain>brains</mod>, but also <ins>by</ins> using all senses. It means that people usually use all five senses, such as <mod target = eye>sight</mod>, <mod target = nose>smell</mod>, or <mod target = ear>hearing</mod> to get knowledge derived from experience. The term 'implicit knowledge' clearly shows this point. It helps people embody their experienced knowledge to their memory and body, leading them to remember knowledge as long as possible. Many studies reveal that knowledge obtained from experience <mod target = endure>endures</mod> longer <del>time to people </del>due to the reasons addressed above. For instance, although people do not <mod target = get skills>learn</mod> how to drive a car by book, they can usually do well because of their knowledge gained by using all senses, from seeing to motion. <br><br>Second, a large number of requisite knowledge in <del>a</del> daily life is knowledge <ins>gained</ins> from experience, not from specialized books.  I agree that <mod target = mathematics>mathematic</mod> skills, <mod target = principle>principles</mod> of physics and any subject which is <mod target = complicating>complicated</mod> <mod target = are>is</mod> crucial for <ins>the</ins> improvement of human society.

I firmly support the idea that many basic skills from experience in a routine life is more important to common people<del>.</del> <mod target = Because>because</mod> they are frequently used by many people and help them to live a happy life. For example, I really wanted to learn how to play tennis when I was fifteen. At that time, I read lots of tennis related magazines. However, to know from books is one thing and to play tennis is another. Only after practicing tennis with my friend could I enjoy playing tennis.

According to the Ministry of Education of Korea<ins>,</ins> in 2010, there was a difference between two groups of high school students in managing their pressure on making new friends.

959&eating home-made food is better than eating out in restaurants or food stands":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is which <ins>it</ins> is better to eat home-made food or to eat out in restaurants. The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out<ins>,</ins> but<del>,</del> as far as I am concerned, I prefer to eat out. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <br><br>To begin with, it is beneficial to eat out since we are able to enjoy various kinds of world<del>'s</del> food in restaurants.  Nowadays, there are so many restaurants from all over the world such as Mexican, Spanish or Thai restaurants. Eating out has <ins>a</ins> strong advantage to experience those sorts of world<del>'s</del> food. For example, my family decided to <mod target = have dinner>eat</mod> out at least once a month and try a variety of <del>kinds of </del>world<del>'s</del> dishes. Each time, one of the family members chooses what to eat and other members ought to follow his decision <del>whether someone does not like his option or not</del>. This policy proved beneficial because all of the members found that there are a lot of delicious and healthy dishes from all over the world. My family still maintains this successful plan and I am really sure that <ins>the</ins> rest of my family <del>members </del>also anticipate the next surprising <mod target = eating out>dinner</mod>. In this regard, eating out provides a good opportunity to experience a diversity of foods from other countries. <br><br>On top of that, there is no need to burden ourselves to do dishes or make food<del>s</del>.  Most <del>of</del> mothers usually spend a large amount of time <del>on </del>preparing dishes for <ins>their</ins> <mod target = family>families</mod>. It could be irritating for mothers to <mod target = make>prepare</mod> <mod target = dishes>food</mod> <del>for</del> every day. Thus, eating out could be a solution for mothers since they do not need to worry about those burdensome <mod target = works>tasks</mod>. According to <del>a </del>recent research from Oxford University, the families who eat out regularly <mod target = shows>show</mod> a high level <del>of sense </del>of happiness while the families who rarely eat out <mod target = presents>present</mod> <ins>a</ins> relatively lower level <del>of that</del>. The researchers examined the reason for this and they found that the top rationale was that the family members feel doing dishes or preparing meals are quite boring and tedious. Therefore, the families prefer to eat out and it <mod target = help>helps</mod> <del>for </del>them to improve their sense of happiness. In this sense, eating out has a strong advantage to avoid boring things and it would be beneficial for <ins>a</ins> family's happiness. <br><br>In conclusion, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of <ins>the</ins> two reasons mentioned above. Once again, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim. <br><br>":::

966&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should try several different jobs before getting a long-term job.

They argue that trying several jobs before finding <del>out </del>a long-term job is helpful for their career as well as their life. However, I disagree with this argument and firmly believe that people had better search for a long-term job from the <mod target = start>beginning</mod>. My opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below. <br><br>First of all, it can be harmful for people who want to have a <mod target = secured>secure</mod> job if they <mod target = habe>have</mod> tried many different jobs beforehand.  In other words, people should search for a good job and stick to it<ins>;</ins> otherwise<ins>,</ins> they can give a bad signal to employers.

To our surprise, language proficiency or good grades were not their top priority. They regarded 'loyalty' as the most important factor when hiring workers. To put it in another way, they hated those who tried too many different jobs before applying for their company. They thought these applicants were not loyal <del>to company</del>, easy to <mod target = go out>leave</mod> voluntarily if they were unsatisfied with their job, and not patient <del>to much stress</del> in the workplace. Rather, they highly liked to hire <ins>those</ins> who had no prior experience and possessed <ins>a</ins> fresh mind. To avoid the possibility <del>that</del> <ins>of being</ins> regarded as a mistrusted person, people should not try several chances before getting a long-term job. <br><br>Second, people can substitute taking several job risks with many internship programs.  These days, many colleges and corporations provide various internship programs for <mod target = to-be>prospective</mod> workers. By <mod target = experience>interning</mod> <ins>with</ins> several <del>internship </del>programs <del>several times</del>, people can find out what their real interest is and what kinds of factors they consider the most for a long-term work. After knowing these things, people can apply for the most suitable job to them and it can help them not to move among many jobs. In addition, applying for an internship is easier <del>to get a chance than </del>trying to find <del>out </del>a real job. With a small effort, time and cost, people can discover their true interest and priority. <br><br>All things considered, I highly support the idea that people should not try several jobs<del>, and had better stick to a first job</del>. One legendary CEO in South Korea <mod target = recollected>recalled</mod> <mod target = his>a</mod> memory, saying that 'Although it was hard to figure out whether my first job <mod target = was>would</mod> suit to me at that time, I finally can conclude that it was <mod target = my>the</mod> best choice I have ever made in my life.

968&All teachers are required to update their knowledge every five years":::"An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether teachers ought to update their knowledge every five years. The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <br><br>To begin with, teachers should revise their knowledge following changes in the world.  In a modern society, information and knowledge change so quickly that things believed to be true <mod target = would be>are</mod> <mod target = converted into false>proven to be falsehoods</mod> <mod target = at even a>every</mod> day. Therefore, living in <mod target = the>such an</mod> era, teachers should be forced to update their knowledge. For example, when I was a high school student, I had a very old teacher and he was about to retire from his work. His class was <del>so </del>infamous since he taught students seriously old theories<ins>.</ins> Students requested the teacher to <mod target = deal with>discuss</mod> contemporary knowledge but he did not care <ins>to</ins> at all. In the end, we were taught absolutely useless knowledge for a year. In this regard, teachers should be required to update their knowledge on <ins>a </ins>regular <mod target = period>basis</mod>. <br><br>On top of that, if teachers are to be asked to update their knowledge and this policy is to be settled, <ins>the </ins>quality of education would be improved significantly.  Suppose this policy is settled firmly<ins>;</ins> then teachers ought to try to improve their own knowledge. There is an adequate example for this situation. One of my friends' schools adopted this sort of policy <mod target = to>for</mod> its teachers. The teachers were provided proper opportunities and conditions to update their knowledge. Teachers were pleased at those chances since they also thought that they needed those opportunities. After several years, it <mod target = is>was</mod> proved that the quality of teaching augmented dramatically and the school <ins>was</ins> rewarded <mod target = for>as</mod> <ins>the</ins> ""innovative school of the year.” In this sense, this plan would <mod target = incline>increase</mod> the quality of teaching and students <mod target = will>would</mod> <mod target = get benefits>benefit</mod> from it. <br><br>In conclusion, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of <ins>the</ins> two reasons mentioned above.

However, contrary to such a belief, I strongly argue that there are two merits if they rely on their parents.

Today, high school students are even too <mod target = hectic>busy</mod> and stressed out to follow regular courses because they have to get high scores from the tests.

For example, there are schools specialized in science and mathematics for gifted students in Korea.

Moreover, <ins>the</ins> lecture component of classes is a panoramic view of what <ins>the </ins>professors expect <mod target = me>the student</mod> to know and what the test questions will be like. Books usually contain <ins>a </ins>comprehensive range of materials<ins>,</ins> yet lack the ability to highlight vital information. In addition, through attending classes, one obtains valuable opportunities to participate in <mod target = discussion>discussions</mod> with classmates and professors. By interacting with and asking <del>professors</del><mod target =  inquiries>questions</mod>, students come to learn what was previously unknown and <mod target = confronts>confront</mod> opposing viewpoints, which is not achieved through reading tons of books on class materials. <br><br>How attending lecture improves <mod target = grade>grades</mod> is simple yet multidimensional <del>fundamentals</del>.  From my four years of college experience, I can confidently insist that there is no better strategy than attending classes regularly to be a good test taker. Unless I went through <ins>the</ins> basic ideas of each lecture and set aside time for complementing this knowledge, I used to cram for the test <ins>the</ins> night before and the test <mod target = result was>results were</mod> devastating when I did that. The best tactic is to study diligently every week, but I soon realized this is accomplished only by being in every class. I came to approach the topics easily and tackle information only when <ins>I </ins><mod target = sit>sat</mod> there to listen to lectures and take notes. Besides preparing me for exams, attending lecture improved my overall grade by helping <ins>with</ins> homework problems and answering some of my questions. <br><br>Whether it is generally agreed or disagreed, I think every <mod target = story of students>student's experience can</mod> prove that attending class is essential to success in college<del> classes</del>. Along with teaching you fundamental responsibility as a student and job <mod target = candidates>candidate</mod>, class participation provides information outside <ins>of</ins> books and other viewpoints on issues.

981&Do you agree or disagree with following statement?

However, it is getting <mod target = exuberant>exaggerated</mod> and people put too much emphasis on them. I totally agree with the statement, and this is greatly substantiated by the reasons presented below. <br><br>To start with, some people <mod target = even are taking>go so far as to take</mod> risks to improve their appearance.  To put it another way, even though they are aware of the danger they<del> should</del> risk, some people are still <mod target = wanting and taking>opting for</mod> cosmetic surgery.

This proves <mod target = for>to</mod> what extent people are concerned about their appearance<ins>,</ins> and<del> that</del> it is too much if <ins>one</ins> <mod target = think>thinks </mod>rationally. <br><br>On top of that, annually changing fashion trends also <mod target = shows>show</mod> that people are putting too much <mod target = concern>importance</mod> on their fashion.  In other words, new fashion trends are altering old ones rapidly because people desire to be <mod target = differentiated with>different from</mod> others. Thus, in every season, completely different sorts of <mod target = clothings>clothing</mod> compared to <ins>the </ins>previous year are exhibited in magazines. For instance, almost all of my friends go to shopping when season changes, because <ins>the </ins><mod target = clothings>clothing</mod> they have <mod target = are>is</mod> already out of date.

Children should not make important decisions alone""":::"Along with vast societal advancements, some issues are gaining popularity among the populace, one of which is whether <ins>or not</ins> children should be left to make important decisions alone. In view of today's communal conditions, it would be inappropriate to let children make important decisions all by themselves; however<ins>,</ins> it would be more suitable to guide them and oversee them <del>to</del> make <ins>the</ins> right choices. Amidst the insurmountable bases which <mod target = formulated>formulate</mod> my stand, seemingly<ins>,</ins> there are two eye-catching facets. <br><br>The initial motive for my stand that is exceptionally evident is that the problems that children face these days are too complicated.  It is simply too hard for children to <mod target = estimate>extrapolate</mod> <mod target = what>how</mod> their choice would eventually turn out. For example, when children choose which subject to take at school<ins>,</ins> they tend to choose a subject with <ins>a</ins> <mod target = less>lower</mod> burden or simply follow their friends. However, there are some essential prerequisite subjects that they need to take in order to understand more difficult subjects to come. One of my <mod target = friend>friends</mod><del>,</del> who wanted to become a software developer<del>,</del> stopped taking math classes after 7th grade because he found it very boring. He thought there was no connection between <mod target = computer>computers</mod> and math. Apparently<ins>,</ins> he failed to get an admission <mod target = for>to</mod> the computer science department and regrets his foolish decision greatly. <br><br>A further cause <ins>of</ins> why I am for the same opinion with <ins>the</ins> <mod target = aforesaid>aformentioned</mod> explanation is that children do not have ability to be responsible for their decisions.  Sometimes a wrong decision might cost thousands of dollars to others and the person who made such <ins>a </ins>decision. However, children do not posses such <mod target = amount>amounts</mod> of money or legal responsibility for the damage they have done. All <ins>the</ins> aftermath will be left for their parents or guardians. It is very obvious that a decision should be left for the person who will be responsible for the consequences. <br><br>To sum up, it is not appropriate to let children make important decisions alone because problems they face are too complicated and they are usually not responsible for what they have done. Anchored on <mod target = aforesaid>aforementioned</mod> evaluations and arguments<ins>,</ins> we can conclusively say that children should not make important decisions alone. However, everything has two sides, it would not be wise to oppress children and tie their hands because they need to develop <ins>a</ins> sense of self-esteem.

984&Playing computer games is a waste of time.

However, since there are more negative effects of enjoying computer games than positive ones, I think that children should not be allowed to play them. This is because computer games contain harmful <mod target = contents>content</mod> such as violence or sex, and children can be addicted to the games easily, which ruins their grades. <br><br>First of all, many computer games have violent or sexual features, which <del>give </del><mod target = negative>negatively</mod> influences <del>on </del>children's personality <ins>and</ins> development.  To be specific, if children repeatedly play games related to shooting guns and killing others, they get used to those actions and can be confused between the game and the real world where they live. For example, last year a <mod target = ten years old>ten-year-old</mod> kid shot his friend with his father's bullet in <ins>the</ins> U.S.A. The kid said that his friend made him angry <mod target = for>over</mod> a tiny <mod target = fault>dispute</mod><ins>,</ins> so he killed him. The police who investigated <del>on</del> him found out that he constantly played a cruel shooting game<ins>,</ins> so he became aggressive. This example shows a negative effect of playing computer games. <br><br>Secondly, addiction to computer games causes children to <mod target = get poor academic performance>perform poorly in academics</mod>.  Specifically, many people can be easily addicted to computer games because the games have features that make people continue to play. Especially, since children in general have less ability to control themselves, they are more likely to be addicted and it leads to getting poor grades from <del>their </del>school. For instance, a report conducted by a famous psychologist shows that children addicted to playing computer games have lower grades <del>from school </del>than ordinary children.

However, in my opinion, I believe that the television <del>did </del>gave a larger impact on people's lives.

991&Human activities have enhanced and improved the Earth. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?":::"Earth is filled with many species of creatures and <mod target = surrounding>different</mod> environments. In a short time, compared to long history of the earth, people <strong>have</strong> made very impressive products and evolved if the topic is <strong>only</strong> just limited to human<strong>s</strong>. <mod target = In contrast>However, it is my opinion that</mod> the whole earth has <mod target = recessed>suffered</mod> <strong>due to humans</strong> and my argument is greatly substantiated by the reasons presented below.<br><br>To start with,<del> this is because</del> human activities are only <mod target = zoomed in>concerned with</mod> human<strong>s</strong>.  To put it another way, we human<strong>s</strong> <mod target = did>do</mod> not care about anything if it is<strong> not </strong>related to our developent. Even in western society, they viewed nature as <del>the</del> products to use for their own <mod target = establishment>advancement</mod>. It has not been <del>so</del> long <mod target = that>since</mod> we began to care about nature<del>, though it is little</del>. There are distinct <mod target = features>examples</mod> that show how earth has <strong>been</strong> affected by human activities. Many other creatures living on earth were just considered trivial. According to research conducted by UN, from 1900 to 1950, more than 20% of all the insects in the world <mod target = extincted>became extinct</mod> because they have no habitat to live in<strong>,</strong> which is caused by human activity. <mod target = Even more>Furthermore</mod>, 50% of remaining insects <mod target = extinced>became extinct</mod> in the period <mod target = of>from</mod> 1950 to 2000 <mod target = by>due to</mod> human-related activities. It is obvious that human<strong>s</strong> <mod target = only one sort of creatures are making whole earth devstated>are devastating the Earth</mod>. <br><br>On top of that, human activities are making serious changes regarding <strong>the</strong> surrounding <mod target = circumstances>environment</mod>.  In other words, the weather<del>s</del> and <strong>other </strong>events<strong> that </strong>occur in nature <strong>were</strong> altered drastically in such a short <mod target = term>amount of time</mod>. There are so many things that have changed<del>, so just</del> <strong>only </strong>crucial things <mod target = could>will</mod> be listed <mod target = in>om</mod> this page. <del>This is also published on </del>UN research<del>, and its contents </del>said that 40% more deserts <mod target = were>have been</mod> created since 1900. In addition, ozon<strong>e</strong> layers are completely <mod target = destructed>destroyed</mod> in some <mod target = realm>areas</mod>, which can greatly effect <mod target = on causing>rates of</mod> cancer or other serious diseases. Not only that, exotic events are happening all over the world<strong>:</strong> <del>including</del> El Nino, tsunami<strong>s</strong> and <mod target = etc>others</mod>. I had a<del>n</del> vivid experience<del>,</del> which would support my argument. In Korea, earthquake<strong>s</strong> rarely happen<del>s</del> because the location of the nation is in the middle of <mod target = the>a tectonic</mod> plate <del>which constitutes the Earth</del>. However, from 10 years ago, the frequency of earthquake<strong>s</strong> began to <mod target = raise>rise</mod>.

Now, it is not so strange<del> to </del>listening <strong>to</strong> the news announcing <strong>an </strong>earthquake in Korea. <br><br>To summarize, I believe human activities <strong>have</strong> made an absolute change on Earth in a bad way.

""992&The opinions of celebrities, such as certain actors and athletes are more important for younger people than for older people.""":::"It is evident that in our current society, one's opinion has a tremendous importance in our lives. Some people think that the opinions of celebrities are more important for older people than for younger people, while others do not. I however, believe that the opinions of celebrities, such as certain actors and athletes<ins>,</ins> are <ins>more </ins>important for younger people than for older people.

In current society, younger people are really stressed out. This reminds me of a time when I was <ins>a </ins>sophomore in university. I was able to decide a candidate among several candidates because one figure I have respect <ins>for</ins> presented his opinion on his Social Network Service. My parents read <ins>the </ins>newspaper every morning, and watch the news whenever they watch television. I<ins>,</ins> however, do not like watching the news because it is too <del>much</del> stressful, so it was pretty difficult for me to decide <mod target = whom to>who should</mod> be selected. One day, my favorite actor Kim posted his opinion about <ins>a </ins>politician and I agreed with him.

Success is very important in our lives. A recent newspaper article I read <mod target = on>in</mod> the Korea Herald revealed some interesting findings. According to a survey, the amount of young <mod target = CEO>CEOs</mod> who are affected<mod target =  from>by</mod> celebrities has increased twofold in the past 5 years. The subjects mention that the opinions of celebrities are more <mod target = efficient>effective</mod> than those of their friends, and families. This is because many young people<del> do</del> watch television, use smart <mod target = phone>phones</mod>, and read books. In contrast, older people watch television, use smart <mod target = phone>phones</mod>, and read books less than younger people. Through these activities, it is easy to <ins>have </ins>access to <ins>the </ins><mod target = thought and opinion>thoughts and opinions</mod> of eminent people. This result clearly shows that opinions of celebrities are more important for many younger people. <br><br>All things considered, <mod target = with>for</mod> the reasons mentioned above, I believe that I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic. <br><br>
