<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teachers couldn't adjust to all students.</MI1> <SI1>Some students need teaching more, other students need considerable expertise in a class. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, in a class, if a student needs more explanation about a easy problem, and if another student asks a more advanced problem, what will a teacher do?

Your school has enough money to purchase either computer for students or books for the library. Which should your school choose to buy – computers or book?

Some people might think it would be uncomfortable to share a room with someone unknown.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Obviously</TR>, it would not be easy to live with a stranger.</MI1> <SI1><TR>At first</TR>, I would feel awkward. But I could use this situation as an opportunity.

This was the biggest mistake of most of unhappy roommates. They wanted to live with a friend so as to feel comfortable. But this caused a lot of problems, because they did not take care of each other while they were in the same room. Frankly speaking, I guess I would make the same mistake if I were in that situation.

Use specific reasons to support your answer.,::,"<IN><TS>In general, people are not satisfied with what they have. In many religions, because of this tendency, people can never feel happy. Perhaps, that is true. But the other side of the coin of the fact is that people have developed themselves so as to get something more.

I think it is because people normally compare a person, having something more or better than them, with themselves. <TR>Therefore</TR>, in spite of being considered rich, as long as there is more rich person, he or she can never be satisfied with what they have.

<BO2><MI2>In academic field, this tendency could play an important role.</MI2> <SI2>People want to know something more than others. They are never satisfied with what they have already known.

What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)?

Of course there are a lot of reasons, I think both the improvement of medical techniques and the nutritional diet tables cause this phenomenon. To illustrate why I convince my point, I will treat only a few significant reasons with my vivid experience as follows.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Above all<TR>, I want to point out break-though development in medical techniques.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, according to a medical magazine, surveyed in 2003, human-beings' median life span is 88 years old.</EX> This scrutiny shows the life span has increased more 20 years than the past. It causes the development in treatment for patient. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I am of the idea that improved medical techniques help this phenomenon.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2> Another reason is eating habit.</MI2> <SI2>As human-being live in comfortable circumstance, they have concerned with the nutrition in foods. So, when people think of profusions, they often envision nutrition which these foods contain. And, they usually have habitual eating time for their health. <TR>In addition</TR>, they prefer to eat vegetables, rather than to eat meat. Because vegetables prevent fat, and enable people to clean their blood. In other words, to eat nutritious and balanced diet tables keep them more healthful. <TR>Thus</TR> I think balanced and nutritious diet tables help for people to live longer than the past.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all</TR>, I strongly think that human-beings live longer than the past. The reason why I think like this is not only because the medical techniques have improved, but also the diet tables have more nutritious than the past. Of course there are a lot of reasons to consider, I believe there is no substitution for afore-mentioned things.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,"This is an above average quality essay.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN><TS>In the past in Korea, children were valuable workers. <TR>Therefore</TR>, parents had the tendency to have more children. In the course of time, <TR>However</TR>, parents had fewer kids than before and seemed to cherish them. That is to say, children were hardly expected to become a energy source. <TR>However</TR>, if kids did not help household chores, they would not lose the important factors such as the relation and respect.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR> of all, household things need conversation.</MI1> <SI1>It means that the relation between family members could be better than before through talking about each other. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my father was always a being hard to say something related with family affairs. But, as time has passed, I had the chance to settle this chilly relationship through having a dialogue from simple to complex.</EX> Now, I have the good relationship with my father.

The definition of a on-line game is that through an Internet, they play a game with other people. They can chat and play with other players.
