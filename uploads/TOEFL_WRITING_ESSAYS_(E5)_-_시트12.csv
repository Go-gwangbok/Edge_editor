"1&""Which is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city.""",::,"<IN><TR>Nowadays</TR>, the importance of environment in which children are grown has been emphasized gradually. <TR>In other words</TR>, surroundings may have a tremendous effect on the growth of kids. Following this trend, some people argue that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside whereas others oppose such thought. There has been a constant debate over this issue.<TS> I, <TR>however</TR>, personally disagree with the former idea since children in the urban area can acquire the better educational conditions as well as improve their capability through positive competition.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, in the big city children can gain an easier access to the many facilities which are advantageous for them.</MI1> <SI1>Since there are more population in the urban regions than in the rural side, it is evident that there are more bookstores, private institutes, gyms, and other establishments in these areas: which surely aid children’s learning and enjoyment. <TR>For instance</TR>, private institutes provide kids with various kinds of lessons such as playing piano, swimming, or ballet. Also, bookstores offer them recent knowledge about the certain field. <TR>Consequently</TR>, children are more likely to meet with better educational environment.<EX><TR>As evidence</TR>, I had lived in a small, rural hometown for seven years before moving to the big city. Until then, even though I desired to learn how to play trumpet, I could not even go to the private institutes due to the lack of such facilities adjacent to my home. <TR>However</TR>, after I moved to the city, I could learn playing the instrument and since than I am satisfactory with living in the big city.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In the second place</TR>, positive competition can be involved when playing and studying with other peers in the urban area.</MI2> <SI2>As there are more children in the similar ages in the urban area rather than in the countryside, kids grab more opportunity to meet with one another. <TR>Thus</TR>, they would have more incentives to do better than others since human beings naturally have competitive mind. <TR>As a result</TR>, this competition prompts those children to seek as well as improve their hidden aptitude and potential talent. <EX><TR>To illustrate</TR>, my brother used to think that for him, it is no use of studying subjects any harder for he had already been a perfect student in his elementary school. <TR>However</TR>, after he moved to the urban city with his family two years ago, he realized that there are far more students learning and studying with passion in the big city. Now, he studies hard due to the positive competition.</EX></SI2></BO2> 

<CO><TR>In a nutshell</TR>, I disagree that living in the countryside is better for children than living in the big city owing to the huge number of facilities and positive competition. Of course, I admit that countryside can offer kids the fresh environment and peace. <TR>However</TR>, children can still meet with the environment by other means such as going vacation. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I firmly believe that living in the big city is more beneficial for kids.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"This essay is quite good, but you can make your thesis statement stronger by saying the point you disagree with (or agree with) instead of just alluding to it.

2&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A person’s years ( the time birth to twelve years of age) are the most important years of a person’s life. Use specific reasons and examples to suppory your answer.,::,"<IN>A person’s life consists of many years such as childhood, adolescence, man hood, and old age. Among these years, some people consider their adolescence years the most important years of their life. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I agree that a childhood years are the most important years in that people can acquire a language skill and form a shape of their basic personality before graduating the elementary school.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, people can master foreign languages by the education before they are 12 years old.</MI1> <SI1>A language skill is very important in people’s life, but it is impossible that adults learn foreign languages in short time such as 6 months or 1 years, so it can hardly help improving language skills. <TR>For example</TR>, according to the Department of Education of the United Kingdom, turning point of learning languages is the time when people are 12 years old. In the case of children, they have a capability to make certain rooms for what they are heard in their brain, which palys a role in language reservoirs. <TR>Thus</TR>, children can learn foreingn languages for a short time relative to adults. <TR>Therefore</TR>, the language education is more useful for their life in childhood.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, people can develop their fundamental personality in their youths.</MI2> <SI2>As personality make an influence on the Whole life, it is very important. By and large, the ordinary people gain basic knowledge to differenciate between right an wrong through their youth’s experience. <TR>Thus</TR>, although characteristics is formed from birth to dead, it is safe to say that not all the adults spending worse childhood sould have a healty wat of thinking. According to Harvey klein, an American psychologists, all things of this period become vivid memory in person’s unconsciousnees, shich decides their future. <TR>In this manner</TR>, people form the foundation of their personality, which is essential for him to live in society.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, although some people say that childhood years is just the stage to prepare adolescent years, I think that this period makes the most important influece on life because people have better language skills and the foundation of personality to make their life valuable. Were it not for their childhood years, people would had a hard time living in society.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,A very good essay!

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>Although most people is satisfied with their hometown, they may have one more things to change. I also have one important thing to alter about my hometown. My hometown has many advantages such as high-tech industries, high quality education facilities, and well-organized traffic system, but doesn't have suitable green area. <TS>If I could, I would like to modify green area system of my hometown.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, nature provide us with pleasant rest place, and I will make more parks in my hometown.</MI1> <SI1>In my hometown, there are fairly good entertainment items like theaters, fitness clubs, cafes, and so on. But they are not related with nature. <TR>For example</TR>, my hometown's population is 50 million, there are only two small parks. So, those parks is crowded always, especially on weekend, and their environment is harmed rapidly. Because of convenient transport system in my village, if parks are made in different place, numerous residents can access easily. Also, they can relax and enjoy greens like trees, flowers, fountains, and lawn carpets with jogging, picnic, going for a stroll. <TR>At times</TR>, we gain satisfaction and relaxation more open space than indoor space. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I think that my town need to add to parks.</SI1></BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>Next</TR>, making abundant green is contribute to clean air, because green area has ability to reduce air pollution.</MI2> <SI2>My hometown is known as numerous venture companies. The companies are employing not only our dwellers but also numberless people from different regions and some satellite towns. Most of them use cars in commuting. The cars emit toxic gas such as carbon dioxide, and the gas pollute air we are breathing. Plants absorb CO2, give out O2. And, many research proved that various trees have useful a function to cleanse. Green area of my village is insufficient to acquire the effect. There are some ways to add green area. For instance, the one is to plant trees along city roads and the other is to promote making garden in houses and office buildings.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Now, my home town is good place to live in. <TR>However</TR>, when green area become more abundant, it has positive effects which are healthy and salutary rest zone like a park and clean air.

<BO1><TS>The tradition of respecting the older has many advantages.</TS> <MI1><TR>Firstly,</TR> families and societies can learn much precious knowledge from the older people when we respect them.</MI1> <SI1>Because older people lived longer life than younger people, they have plenty of valuable experiences in there lives.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, social order can be maintained by respecting older people.</MI2> <SI2>Respecting gives authority to the older people.

",::,"<IN>Childhood years are precious to all people in the meaning of early experiences of life. A glance at study shows that experiences in childhood determine the characteristic in their whole life.

<BO1><MI1>Early formal education offers young children easy adaptation to study.</MI1> <SI1>They usually absorb much knowledge like sponges because their brains are so fresh that it can memorize everything they experience. If parents teach a foreign language to their babies, they can speak it perfectly in a year. It never happens in the age of 20.

"10& You have been told that dormitory rooms at your university must be shared by two students. Would you rather have the university assign a student to share a room with you, or would you rather choose your own roommate? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.
",::,"Elementary, middle, and high school students go to school next the place they live. However, when we choose university, we must consider our grades and our major rather than our habitant. Then, if the university located in the far distance from our house, we would live in the dormitory of our university. In turn, we must live in one space with any other friend. In that cast, I think that it is much better for us to choose the friend. There are a couple of reasons for my perspective. 

Firstly, we can share with a friend who has the same major as mine. We may talk with the same title together as well as give and take information which is relate to our major each other. In result, that allow us to have a chance that can develop in our major field. In university life, it is important that we gradually accumulate knowledge about major field. 

Secondly, we already know personality and hobby of the other person. Because we could have known information and surround about the friend, like old friends, we will be able to concern about situation of the mate well. Moreover, if we has the same hobby, we would spend the time enjoying the hobby which my roommate and I everyone want. We don't have trouble having spare time and pastime with the roommate. 

In summary, I strongly insist that university offer us the system which can select dormitory's partner by oneself.

They just wake up early in the morning and go working. That is no exception for teenage students like me. To emphasize my idea, I will show you how my daily life goes. I have to go to an academy and study until 2:30 a.m, go back home, raise my tired body to wake up, and again go school. This is my daily life and as you see from this I have no time to concentrate on the problems I have as a teen. <TR>However</TR>, when you go fishing, you can have a rest and think about the things you have done and what you have said.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><TR>Secondly</TR>, it gives you how the life goes on.<SI2>All people want to be successful with everything they do. <TR>However</TR>, they soon realize the great obstacle that is blocking their way to the success and give up. Fishing is like this. People who give up waiting patiently cannot get a fish. <TR>However</TR>, those who wait patiently and do not give up can get a fish. I think 'waiting' refers to the stage in which people try to be successful and the excitement after the waiting would be the success. <MI2>From fishing, people can learn great amount of lesson and lessen the stress.</MI2></SI2></BO2>

It is because people's tastes are different, and both approaches come with advantages and disadvantages. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I prefer to change because I think that it has more advantages: it extends my life's boundary and grows me as a person.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>One reason people remain the same is that routine is comfortable and there is no challenge to scare them.</MI1> <SI1>They enjoy peaceful lives. <TR>However</TR>, it can be boring. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, they are not able to grow themselves by doing new tasks. <TR>For example</TR>, one person afraid to swim in the deep pool, so she always plays in shallow.

<BO1>There are numerous reasons why I insist on this, and I would in here explain two of the most important ones. <MI1>The first reason is that imagining the best situation may make people unsatisfied.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Generally</TR>, people has desire to have better things than what they had.

<BO2><MI2>Another reason why I advocate this is that people are apt to compare their situation with others’ one.</MI2> <SI2>Because people tend to dicide whether their state is good or not by comparison with others, they seldom satisfy their wealth. <TR>For example</TR>, if someone is located on low class in their society, he would always stare the life of middle class to level his life up. <TR>However</TR>, although he accomplish his goal such as entering the middle class, he would also compare him with higher class, so he won’t consider his life the completed one as if an old saying goes that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. <TR>Therefore</TR>, the people’s habits to evaluate them on the basis of others’ wealth lead them to unadmitted situation.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1>One of the basic goals of universities is guide students to study their interesting field.</MI1> <SI1>Each student chooses a subject which is harmonious to their purpose or career goals.

If it is right, there are two different aspects. One is negative effect and the other positive one to people: imitating bad action and providing useful information.</IN>

<BO1>Development Psychology was a course on the human being as an infant, developing into an adult and the different psychological factors for each growth stage. In other words, I was able to find out why people are the way they are according to their habits as an infant. 

<EX>I had an experience where I was able to relieve my friend's anxious behavior by explaining to him a possible cause of it. My friend had a habit of eating whatever was placed in front of him, especially when he was anxious or nervous. He especially searched for little snacks like, nuts or chips and would constantly be munching on them. He complained that he needed to keep his mouth busy or he felt nervous again. 

That is when I recalled a class in Psychology where the professor explained about the infant being oral retentive, which could mean the infant has not been satisfied in its sucking desires. For example, the mother might have breast-feeded and stopped too soon for the baby to adjust well. The baby would always feel a dissatisfaction from that and form an oral retentiveness. 

The symptoms are: one has a tendency to eat a lot, especially when stressed and just to keep the mouth busy, chatters a lot. 

I explained this to my friend who was starting to get worried about his eating disorder and he was very relieved to know what may be the cause and lessened his worries altogether.

They had to hear any demand in order to repairing or advancing each depart, but they neglected each depart's needs because they weren't allowed to agree all of their demanding. <TS>If my school had received a gift of money, they would use it to develop each depart.

<BO1><MI1>I truly believe Neighbors should be reliable.</MI1> <SI1>In the world, people cannot live alone. Wherever people live in, they generally have neighbors. If people do not believe each other, they have many burdensome and unnecessary works that do not happen when people believe neighbors. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, if your neighbors are not reliable, whenever you go out, you are more nervous.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the countryside is like a classroom without walls in itself.</MI1> <SI1>Parents assume their children will not have the same educational advantages that city children have, if their children are brought up in the countryside. <TR>However</TR>, that is far from the truth. The countryside is rich with learning material and tools such as the trees, the birds, the rivers and the soil etc. Through hands-on experience from nature, children will gain more valuable knowledge than from reading books.</SI1></BO1>

218&Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Compare these two views. Which view do you agree with ? why?,::,"<IN>For the twenty years in Korea, I have witnessed young mothers overzealously educating their children. It went to a point where pregnant Korean women were reading English out loud and solving complex math problems to “educate” their fetus. <TS>I somewhat understand how anxious these mothers must be to endow a perfect education to their young children so that they can grow up to lead successful lives. However I sympathize more with the burdened and overworked young children because I believe a formal education at a very early age has more disadvantages than not.</TS></IN>

<BO1><SI1><EX><TR>To illustrate my point</TR>, I would like to share the true story of a Korean boy who was on the Guiness book of world records for being the youngest person to have the highest IQ. He was so smart he was able to study college courses at the age of five. Evidently, many parents envied this very young genius and wondered how great he would turn out to be. Decades later, the “genius” was on the news, and everybody was surprised to find out that he was not different from anybody else and lead a very average life. He had a good education and he was still smart, but it did not necessarily lead him to higher or greater places. Apparently, he was exhausted with all the vigorous work and study starting from a young age and felt the need to break away from the pressures and high expectations from the people around him.</EX></SI1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, I believe a natural way of letting things grow is the best way to some extent.</MI2> <SI2>Since we are all a part of nature, this natural way of growing is best for plants, animals and even human beings. If we interfere with or try to speed up the natural process of things, many times, we do not see the results we intended to. <EX><TR>To exemplify</TR>, young parents who are extremely eager to see their babies walk, train them in such a way that when the babies are walking at an earlier stage than they should be, the baby grows up to be bow-legged in many cases. This happens because the legs were not fully developed when the parents taught the baby to walk.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Additionally</TR>, a formal education is not the only way a child can become a successful person. Play is also a part of developing the intelligence or social skills of a child.</MI3> <SI3>Playing can mean many things: informal education, resting from studying, socializing with others in the same age group and so on. I believe adequate play time is essential for a young child’s intellectual development.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, forcing a young child to study at an early age will not necessarily bring about miracles in making the child a prodigy that will lead a highly successful life.

229&The qualities of a good neighbor,::,"<IN>I suppose there can be varied ideas about the qualities of a good neighbor. <TS>In my opinion, if you have a good neighbor, I am confident that you have someone who cares about your property, who is helpful in the little day-to-day situations that come up, who is supportive in times of crisis.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>A good neighbor is respectful of your property.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, she asks your permission before doing anything that interfere with what's yours. This means she wouldn't plant a high tree in between your houses without asking how you felt about it. She might work with you to decide where it should be placed. Maybe the two of you would even split the cost.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>A good neighbor would give a hand when you encountered troublesome situations.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For instance</TR>, she would give a ride to work if your car were broken, and let your children stay at her house in the evening if you got stuck working overtime. You would do the same to her.</EX> Both of you help make the other's life easier.</SI2></BO2>

It goes without saying that advertising encourages us. <TS><TR>Therefore</TR>, it is my opinion that advertising is too excessive compelling to consumer is not good, but there is no telling without it about the 21st century.</TS> I prefer telling us about new products that may improve our lives to encouraging us to buy things we really do not need. It has two reasons: first, let us know information of valuable products, and, second, we make similar products compare, in fact, how about quality, how about price, how about function.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, I have working since graduating from university, and I have no time for shopping to buy clothes or everything.</MI1> <SI1>Whenever I felt to need something, I was usually in favor of looking for a megazine or watching televison for shopping.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people who live in a huge urban area have to get many cultural profits.</MI1> <SI1>It is easy to get in a big city because most huge city is big shopping center, theater, bookstore and museum, etc. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I live in Seoul, the capital of Korea, where I often enjoy such cultural facilities as theater, a department store near here.

<BO1><MI1>The most important reason is that students need to learn how to cooperate with the other sex in doing work.</MI1> <SI1>In this point of view, coeducational schools can help students learn social skills. <EX><TR>In my experiences</TR>, I have seen many students who are not familiar with cooperating with the other sex because they have not had opportunities to work with others.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First off</TR>, formal education will be advantageous for children to develop their ability and curiosity.</MI1> <SI1>Children are supposed to go to elementary school, when they are up to a certain age.

Children are easy to find their special gifts, so they can focus on them. Furthermore, early education will let children get well adapted to elementary school life. It could help children to reduce some difficulties such as making friends or observing a rule in school life. Thus, children will learn a lot from early education.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the other hand</TR>, in childhood, playing with others has an important role in forming children’s maturity.</MI2> <SI2>Before children go to school, they usually spend time in playing with friends or parents.

Likewise, spending a lot of time desirable playing will bring children a health and sound development.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1>Basic skills are much more important than other knowledge.</MI1> <SI1>Basic skills include eating skills, dressing skills and toilet training.

This is because it takes so much time for us to know each other's real personality, while we don't have enough time to decide something. <TS>However, I agree the statement that one should never judge a person by looks for these following reasons: features can't reflect someone's everything, and the appearances can 
be affected by unintentional matters.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, I believe someone's looks can't show his or her real character.</MI1> <SI1>These days, almost all the people know what personality our society allows.

317& A big shopping mall plans to have a new branch in the town where you live in. Would you agree with that or would you disagree with that plan?,::,"<IN>Having a big shopping mall around my town may cause some conflicts. Therefore, I would say that I would disagree with the idea of having a branch of the big shopping mall in my town. Some people may call this attitude a part of a NIMBY phenomenon, which is an abbreviation of the clause, “Not In My Back Yard”. This may sound quite reasonable, as the objection of having public shopping mall near someone’s town may appear to be ‘selfish’. <TS>However, under certain reasons and grounds, I oppose to the shopping mall’s plan, 
Those reasons are as follows;</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, there is a problem of the heavy traffic around the shopping mall area.</MI1> <SI1>It is so obvious that there will be a great increase in the amount of traffic, as there will be many cars and vehicles going in and out of the shopping mall. The traffic situation near shopping mall has been getting even worse since the Korean Government has enacted the new traffic policy regarding shopping malls in Korea. The newly enacted law regulates all those shopping malls and department stores not to have their own vehicles for customers. After this law was implemented, the traffic situation has got worse. No one will be happy to live in town where there’s always a heavy traffic.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, the increase in pollution and garbage near the shopping mall will also be one of the biggest concerns for people.</MI2> <SI2>As there will a lot of shopper going around a day, a shopping mall will have a hard time to have a control over the garbage around the mall. Of course, there will be some garbage cans around, but those will not be enough for thousands of people going around. And one cannot really rely on people’s conscience or public manners, hoping that they would use the trashcans every time they throw out the garbage. As far as the pollution problem is concerned, it is so clear that all those cars and vehicles will pollute air.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Last but not least</TR>, we cannot ignore the rights of the owners of the small shops around the town.</MI3> <SI3>Being the owners of the small shops, they always have the problem of little funds and money for their marketing plans and promotion. If there’s a newly built big shopping mall in town where they already had a business, they will have to face some critical risks in their business such as a lack of brand reputation, a shortage of funds etc.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>herefore</TR>, I strongly opposed to the idea of building a new shopping mall in my town. Then, a question may arise as ‘Who will be glad to have a shopping mall in his or her town?’ For this conflict, I would suggest that the mall be located in the middle of the city, being located around the business centers and offices. This will lead to fair competition of the market and diminish the conflicts.

Why? ,::,"<IN>I have a five-year-old nephew who is very curious about Korean, Chinese and English. His interest in linguistic things came from the discipline and education of the kindergarten, in which he learned some words with pictures everyday. <TS>Seeing his remarkable development, I have firmly believed that children would rather start their formal education at as early an age as possible in that earlier education brings children synergy effect from inquisitiveness to educationally effective and efficient results to accompanying sociality.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, early education excites kids much curiosity.</MI1> <SI1>When it comes to learning words, my nephew unceasingly asked people what the names of things in Korean, what that is in English as well, which seem interesting for him.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, that inquisitiveness gives shape to the educational effects on children.</MI2> <SI2>Some linguistic-related surveys show that the earlier people learn foreign language, the faster and the more effectively they can get. The kindergarten taught him English songs with Korean, even Chinese, and then he spoke out the words over and over again, which he had learned with teachers and kids of the same age so that his linguistic ability has been improving surprisingly.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Additionally</TR>, as children study in the educational institute, they naturally experience the community, especially that of the same age.</MI3> <SI3>Even though my nephew was so a shy kid when he was in home all day, he became more active, even mischievous but still very inquisitive boy after joining the children in the kindergarten. The bottom line is that the schooling goes necessarily with the sociality that is needed from the early age.</SI3></BO3>

When we do business, we should correctly analyze the everything concerned with the 'supply and demand.' and marketing of its goods.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, public transportation should be convenient so that the common people may use it easily.</MI1> <SI1>Thus, it needs more budgets of governments to be improved.

366&some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us bout new products that may improve our lives. Which viewpoint do you agree with?,::,"<IN>Some people may hold a opinion that advertisements allure us to buy things we really do not need. Others, however, have a negative attitude. <TS>As far as I am concerned, I truely insist that advertisements influence on our life in good ways.</TS> I think it is justified for the following reasons; firstly, advertisements give us various information, and secondly, consumers have a ability to tell good quality fo products from bad products. Through the use of a couple of examples and specific explanations, I will support my answer.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Fist and most profoundly</TR>, the chief reason is that advertising is the best way to know about products for consumers.</MI1> <SI1>In other words, through advertising, we get information such as price, quality, character of goods. <EX><TR>To exemplify</TR>, if you are looking forward to buy radio, you should know where it is, what price it is, and how you can buy it. There are numourous types of radios in the market, so you have to choose high quality goods at reasonable cost. For wise choice, you must pay attention to advertisements and compare to each product.</EX> In this regard, I totally maintain that advertising is neccessary for people to buy wisely.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Additionally</TR>, the second reason is that consumers are intelligent enough to tell the bad products from good products.</MI2> <SI2>To put it another way, it means you don't have to worry about the fact that advertisings attempt us to purchase things unusable. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, if some company, producing diet food, advertises that you will lose 10kg in a week when you eat it, you know it's probably false. </EX>
Although you buy expensive products and find uselessness, you will learn instrutions from mistakes and never purchase it again. Businesses need advertising to sell their product, but they cannot sell the products siimply by advertising. In this sense, I strongly believe that worrying about overconsumption because of advertisement is somewhat exaggerated.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, some advertisements may try and sell us things that we really don't need, but the majority tells us about products. Consumers are smart enough that they are not fooled by useless advertising. Also, the success of a product depends more on how the product works than how the product is advertised.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we can truly enjoy some cultural events with basic knowledge of art and music.</MI1> <SI1>These days, many cities and counties suggest some valuable art and music at museums and concerts. Enjoying and appreciating these events becomes one of the important leisure lives. If students do not learn basic knowledge of art and music, they cannot enjoy these cultural events.

379&People remember special gifts or presents that they have received. Why? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>People give and take gifts or presents when it’s special day. And people think the presents they have received special and keep them with care. This is because the presents are not just something they themselves have bought. <TS>The present means people not only a present itself but also someone who has prepared the present with thoughtfulness and special meaning why people have given the presents. Those are why people remember special gifts they have received.</TS> With some more specific reasons, I’ll explain why gifts are specially remembered.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the present is something that someone who cares about the receiver has chosen.</MI1> <SI1>So the presents are the ramification of what a giver thought about a receiver with deep thinking and chose one item with contemplation. <EX>I had received books for presents from one of my friends that are good example of it. Those books are about my university majors and what I really looked forward to having but couldn’t afford to buy. My friend knew that and bought those for my birthday presents. I did feel how much she cared about me. So whenever I read those books, those remind me that friend who gave me the books.</EX> Special presents always remind the receiver someone who prepares the present. So the present is remembered specially by the receiver.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, the present is something that someone has prepared for the special day such as wedding day.</MI2> <SI2>So the present has another meaning as the special day other than the present itself. <EX><TR>The best example is a wedding ring</TR>. This ring is not a simple ring. When people prepare the ring for a wedding ring, they do not buy a mere ring but decide to merry someone and prepare both the ring and the future &#8211; forming a family.</EX> That’s why the special present is remembered by the receiver with preciousness.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Presents have many meanings and are given by many reasons and many people. But not every present is remembered specially by the receiver. When the present involves someone who has prepared the present with thoughtfulness and special meaning why people have given the present, it is memorized specially by the receiver. There could be other reasons why the presents are specially remembered. But I think those two reasons are the most significant reasons why some presents are specially remembered by the receivers.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,Some grammar issues but otherwise this is a good essay.,//

Once the buildings were completed, the jobs would be those on the campus itself. Those would include teachers, office workers, custodians, and librarians.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Not all of the people the university hired would already be members of the community, so that would mean a lot of new people coming to town.</MI2> <SI2>Of course, a lot of students would come too.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN><TS>If universities donated a lot of money from someone or company, they could invest various the fields. I disagree them to spend all of their money to their student's sports activities. Firstly, university have to spend at their libraries more money than their student's sports activities because the major activities of the university pursue the academic research. Second, advancing the civilization, all of students demand on them to learn new technology. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I personally insist that universities should give a great deal money to their university libraries.</TS></IN>

Some people insist that more and more lands should be developed for the further economic advances while others argue we must prevent the nature, the God’s blessing, from being damaged by developing them.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it is an obligation to help with household tasks because children are parts of family.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In my case</TR>, when I was a child, I had helped my mother washed dishes. In addition, I had cleaned up my room myself. Through helping with household tasks, I feel that I am also an organization of family and I am proud of myself. <TR>Especially</TR>, after helping with household tasks, I received praise from parents.

494&Some people trust their first impressions about a person’s character because they believe these judgment are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person’s character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Compare these two attitudes. Which attitude do you agree with? Support your choice with specific examples.,::,"<IN><TS>We always make some stereotypes to the others. Some people form the stereotype at first impression while others make it carefully. Both judgment is reasonable, and I am using both of them in my life. However what I trust in deciding of a person's character is the latter one.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>On the one hand</TR>, judging at first impression is very convinient because we can decide quickly whether he(she) is easy to close or not.</MI1> <SI1><TR>At the first meeting if we have a good impression to one person, we can talk to him easily. on the contrary if we have a bad feeling to one, we will not use any efforts to close with him. In this respect. it is very easy and fast way to judge a person. As an example for this, for those who sell the products, judging at first impression is very important because the salespeople have to decide at the first meeting what the customer wants and how they can talk to them about which they are selling.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the other hand</TR>, those who say people can't be judged by first impression are maintain that we should consider about situations.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I met my closest friend at first time, he was very rude and harsh.</EX> So I think he must be a badman, but as I face him more and more I found he is very soft and considerable. Later I knew why he was so angry. when I met him, he lost his wallet and he was very frustrated. For this reason, I think it is dangerous we judge people at first time. We may lose our husband or wife judging by first impressions.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, it is true judging by first impression is a very easy and fast way, but in this way we may have a wrong decisions and interpretations. <TR>So</TR>, for the reasons mentioned above, I agree with the latter attitude.

Some people like to spend time with one or two close friends, while other people want to spend time many friends. Both choices have advantages. In my opinion, I would rather spend time many friends than one or two close friends because spending time many friends give us more opportunities to learn unknown field to me and develop my interpersonal skill.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, Spending time with one or two close fiends has advantages that we can deepen understanding of my friends and manage my time more easily.</MI1> <SI1>It is generally agreed if we have fewer friends, we could strengthen our friendships and control our schedules. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my uncle has only one friend and they have been companions for 20 years.</EX> They understand with each other quite well because they have done everything together since they were elementary school.</SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Most of all</TR>, non-smokers may welcome the regulation about smoking because they are disinclined to be interfered by smokers.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, everybody probably has experienced bad air in restaurants where so many people smoke without any consideration of other people.</EX> There is a statistics that non-smokers who just smell smoke indirectly are more in danger than smokers. Several non-smokers just say “No” if they don’t want to be interrupted by the heavy smokers, but other weak-minded ones have difficulty suggesting honestly to the irritable smokers. If the government regulates banning smoking in public places, non-smokers are certainly pleased so much.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, even smokers also have more advantages under the strong regulation.</MI2> <SI2><TR>Firstly</TR>, they can reduce their smoking.

567&Your school has received a gift of money. What do you think is the best way for your school to spend this money?,::,"<IN><TS>Recently, computer largely influences on our society. In other words, it is an important device, instrument, and skill in our life. It also plays an important role in schools. <TR>However</TR>, my high school hardly had computers at my school ages because of lack school budget. Especially, It has more advantages such as giving a lot of information, providing diversions, and helping studying processes.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>There are numerous reasons why I insist on this, and I would in here explain a few of th most important ones.</MI1> <SI1>The main reason is that students can get a lot of information from computer. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was young, I liked to read various books but my school and library around my house did not have them. <TR>Thus</TR>, I spent on much money to buy books at that time. If my school receives such a luck opportunity, I will support to purchase computers in my school because computers can contain a variety of information and knowledges. <TR>In general</TR>, it is practical when computer is based on software programs like books. As a result, students can easily read books from computer because of its storing ability.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Another reason why I advocate this is that it provides students with diversions.</MI2> <SI2>Studying in their school, students get more stresses due to burden subjects. They are always tired and boring during their class. By the way, in these days, students like games like starcraft which is produced in America. Computer is essential to play games. While students sitting in front of computer enjoy the games, they can forget their bad emotion about study and release lot's of stresses. Diversion is possible by computer. Computer is a magic device for children.</SI2></BO2>
 
<BO3><MI3>One very strong argument for this is that it helps us during studying process.</MI3> <SI3>This is an undeniable fact. For instance, when students write reports in school, computer is an main instrument. If I do a hand writing, I will spend many times and consider letter shapes because teacher may not understand my writing. <TR>However</TR>, computer makes us a little consider about our homework owing to automatic technology. In addition, teaching to student, teachers can transfer concrete information by it. <EX><TR>To illustrate</TR>, photo is an exact example if they use computer and project facilities to students. Students can see direct photo like cell frame by them during biology.</EX></SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, if all these factors are considered, advantages of computer are great in school.

<BO1><MI1><TR>For sure</TR>, early education has something good.</MI1> <SI1><TR>When children are young</TR>, they can easily remember what they learn, so teachers can instruct them more effectively.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a train is a better choice, considering time management.</MI1> <SI1></TR>In other words</TR>, it facilitates any schedules.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, traveling by rail guarantees your safety.</MI2> <SI2>It is generally agreed that a train is one of the safest transportations. According to one research, the traffic accident rate worldwide is several hundred times higher than its counterpart. <TR>In recent years</TR>, rail accidents and deaths are barely reported. <TR>To the contrary</TR>, a bus has much more risks of accidents.

<BO1><MI1>Getting up early to start daily tasks is usually very difficult, especially for those who are not diligent.</MI1> <SI1>It requires strong will to get over drowsiness, and should be almost a fixed habit.

667&What are some qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,::,"<IN>People believe a supervisor in a group have the greatest influence on other employees. Under a good supervisor employees are many advantages, while under a bad supervisor employees are so bored. <TS>Qualities of A good supervisor are diverse thing, among that, I think some important qualities of a good supervisor are consideration for subordinates and leadership skills for the group.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Most of all</TR>, a good supervisor try to put himself in subordinate’s shoes.</MI1> <SI1>If a supervisor try to understand aspects of employees, they would esteem their supervisor. Besides, when a supervisor first try to understand, the well of the heart between a supervisor and subordinates is collapsed, and it made enjoyable mood together in company. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, My father is a boss of his company. His company is so lively. Because my father always consider aspects of employees and try to put himself in subordinate’s shoes, most of a subordinates love my father and his company gain so many money.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, if a supervisor has consideration, the company is lively.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition to consideration for others</TR>, a good supervisor should have leadership skills for the group.</MI2> <SI2>Students need teacher having leadership. <TR>Similarly</TR>, subordinates need a good leader. If a supervisor haven’t leadership skills, his company would undulate, losing direction.

His employees saw his ability of leadership, So they were flustered. <TR>As a result</TR>, Daewoo is declared bankrupt. If the president show leadership skills, they would live.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO>My conclusion is that a good supervisor should be thoughtful for subordinates and exercise leadership skills.

<BO1><MI1>The primary disadvantage that comes from a new factory will be an environmental pollution.</MI1> <SI1>If a factory is built near our village, the factory will have a potential threat to our community all the time, no matter how it is equipped with complete safety devices. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when it rains heavily in summer season, an unexpected inundation will attack the factory.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the cause that I think this phenomenon would be able to extend the life for medicine-skill growth.</MI1> <SI1><TR>For example</TR>, it is widely known that the disease, a cancer, was showed very fearful disease to us. This is because a cancer was high a fatal rate, and it was impossible medical cure. Although it was impossible in the old days, now is possible; the disease is able to check up developed medicine-technique, and it would continually make an anticancer medicine. <TR>Therefore</TR>, developing medicine-skill would keep our health so that we can extend our life.</SI1> </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, eating ample foods is very important in our life because our body require various nourishments. <TR>For instance</TR>, Korean adult people, especially over fifties, suffered from many difficulties when they went through the Korean war because people ran short of provisions.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the reason why I think garlic is important is that it truly enables us to be better prepared for preventing SARS and making anticancer medicine.</MI1> <SI1><TR>For example</TR>, in now days, all the world is disturbed by SARS discovered the latest. This disease is very dangerous and fatal rate is very high, but this is not a preventive medicine. Although SARS is not still a remedy, a fact we know about garlic would be good for SARS-prevention. So, Koreans who eat Kim-chi can avoid from SARS jeopardy. Also, according to a report, it says that garlic is available to prevent an anticancer. So, garlic is used for making an anticancer medicine.

I strongly agree with it for the following reasons. <TS>Personal lives of many celebrities are watched by media, because TV and newspapers do not deliver information that readers ought to know properly.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1>A lot of entertainment programs are used for advertising celebrities’ personal things.</MI1> <SI1>When you turn on any TV 6 or 7 pm on weekends, it is not difficult to see what kind of house your favorite actors live in or how many clothes they retain.

Not only the game is a commercial object, but also we have some good games which are very realistic and helpful to make present life. So I agreed with this following statement.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>First reason is about good game’s advantage that was very helping to make our good life.</MI1> <SI1>Before, I said not only commercial games are existed in the game entertainment. <TR>For example</TR> ‘the Sims’- which was a famous simulation game &#8211; can make to learn about what can I make our family life.

811&What are some of the qualities of a good parent? Use specific details and examples to explain your answer.,::,"<IN>Among most of people, one of the top matters of concerns and interests is how well they rear their children. That’s very universal interests and really important. Every parents have their own way to teach their children. <TS>I believe that there are some criteria to esteem what is good parent. That can make us or me very good parents as long as we always keep in mind.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, parents should listen what their children are saying to them, what they want, and what they’re curious, etc.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when children are very young, they ask their parents tremendous questions like “what is it?”, “Why?” “Who is him?”, “where is my toy?”, etc. They ask about how the babies come out, why their parents love each other, what love is. Some people just feel annoyed and answer curtly.</EX> <TR>However</TR>, it’s very important to answer them kindly. In my case, when I was in adolescence, I was somewhat aberrant. <TR>However</TR>, my mother always tried to listen to what I wanted, what my problem was, and what I want to be in the future. That was so impressive, that I could come back where I’m supposed to be. That’s why I believe that parent have to listen to their children.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR><TR>Also</TR>, parents have to be a good model for their children, especially in the behavior.</MI2> <SI2>As we know, children see and learn what their parents do. If parents throw trashes on the street, children think that’s o.k. for them, too. My father usually goes to fishing, and he loves traveling. He’s also taught us that helping other people is very important to keep the relation with other people. <TR>Now</TR>, I really like fishing and traveling, and I always give the panhandler some money whenever I see them. That became a habit which is formed by my father’s teaching and behavior. <TR>Thus</TR>, parents should be a good sample for the children’s good personalities.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, parents are supposed to encourage their children’s potential or talent.</MI3> <SI3>I believe that it’s very significant to find out the children’s innate ability. The easiest people who do this are their parents because parents spend most of their time with their children. When I was a girl, my parents suggested me to take a music and painting class in institutes near my house. At fist I was bored, I, <TR>however</TR>, realized that I have a great talent at painting. Then I just took a painting class. <TR>Now</TR>, I really appreciate to my parent about that.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>Therefore</TR>, good parents help their children are raised as good and qualified people.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, parents exert influence most on every aspect of children's life by being a role model for them to imitate.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Let us say there is a boy who has watched his or her parents reading, and he is likely to develop a good reading habit.

As for me, my father played a good model, and he has affected me and formed what I am in a good manner.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Taking these points into consideration, I am strongly positive that parents are the best teachers.

School life also can receive an effect of computer and technology. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I prefer to go traditional schools not using modern technology because of a few reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, studying at home with new technology may give enormous amount of knowledge effectively not waste time to go and back on the street. <TR>However</TR>, in traditional school system, it allows them to make a friend and society and to cooperate with their friends.</MI1> <SI1>It can keep students from isolated feeling. If someone lives alone with many knowledgable books like Robinson Crusou, he will not adjust to the community with others. He may not understand the word “help”, “yield”, or “cooperation”. One of important things in surviving life will be an ability to have a sociality to make a harmony with members. In my childhood, I learned how to solve the troubles which were happened between friends and how can help my weak friends. Sometimes I tried to be better than other class mates.

In this situation, the day for sports would be a big pleasure to the number of people. <TR>For instance</TR>, when I was in high school, as a high school festival, we got an athlete meeting which was hold on a week before the final exam.

With playing basketball games, it was possible to make a lot of close friends who I didn't know.

<BO1><MI1>Language is one of the most remarkable features of a nation.</MI1> <SI1><TR>However</TR>, we’re once extorted our language during the Japan colonial period. Most of Korean people have to speak Japanese, and if not our ancestors were slaughtered. Then our culture also disappeared. In case of Ireland, they’ve almost lost their language Irish. One my professor came from Ireland. Though she is English teacher, she didn’t scold us hardly when we use some Korean word in the middle classes. She said that we were so blessed that we had our own language. I totally agree with her. We should recognize that how our language is important for our nation.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, Hangeul is very cultural glorious inheritance.</MI2> <SI2> That Hangeul is highly scientific is generally known as a fact. The rules of spelling of Hangeul are extremely logical and well-organized. That has fourteen consonant and ten vowels. As it is phonetic symbols, every letters show us the shape of the sound which is very astonishing. Not only Korean people, but also many other countries’ linguistics have acknowledged it. We should be proud of it. I believe Hangeul is worthy of being honored.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>I think if we make the Hangeul Day again, we would like to celebrate it as writing a lot of essays, poems or whatever. Namely, we would hold a countrywide writing contest and festival.</MI3> <SI3>Every people could participate in them, even foreigner as long as they can write Korean language. We can have food together wit other people in a particular area of each city, then we write an essay, a poem, a travel sketch or a diary. For Korean, it could be a nice one-day picnic and party.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it’s difficult to find someone who is similar to you at the first time. <TR>That is</TR>, because we all have different characteristics.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Of course</TR>, some may be similar to you than the others, but particularly, we are all very different from one another.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, this is the time the people learn how to do something such as language, art, sports or knowledge. </MI1><SI1>Namely, this is the period of aquisition. Children can learn most easily, rapidly and naturally in this time. Once they pass this time without any acquirement, then they're hard to learn something quickly. <TR>For instance</TR>, a friend of mine have learned playing piano from the age of four, and she is still a very good pianist although she doesn't practice for a long time thesedays. <TR>However</TR>, I started playing piano when I was a middle school student, and I'm still awkward at playing piano. In my grandmother' case, she couldn't learn how to write Korean language because the time was the period of chaos. Because of the colonial period, she didn't have any opportunities to learn writing, and she still doesn't know wring though she's tried to learn several times before. After a person's brain is formed, it's very hard to learn something new.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2></TR>In addition</TR>, this time is the period of forming personalities.</MI2> <SI2> As a research shows that almost all the people's personalities in the world are formed in this time. If a person hardly spends the time in a emotional way, she or he may has mental problem in the future, or perhaps he or she aberrates. <EX>For example, another friend of mine has spent a very hard time from his youth. When he was a ten years old, his parents divorced, so he lived with only mother. To support him his mother worked, and she was very busy. He usually spent his time alone. He said that he had been extremely lonely, so he started aberrant actions such as smoking and drinking from the age of eleven. He finally couldn't go to the middle school and high school.</EX> We can see how much the formation time of personality is crucially important for a person's life. Mental pain, an ordeal, difficulties in this time influence badly to his or her life. We should keep in mind a young youths' fragile characteristics. We should consider them as a developing personality.</SI2></BO2> 

<CO><TR>Therefore</TR>we should keep in mind that this time is most significant time for everybody in the world. These are related to innate abilities rather than the inherited problem, so once we spend this time in a bad way, we never revoke it. I believe that we should take care of our children more</CO>

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement.",::,"<IN><TS>I do not believe that TV has destroyed communication among friends and family.</TS> TV has good and bad aspects.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.,::,"<IN>Whether students should be given one long vacation each year or not sometimes become an interesting issue among people. The opinion could be made in diverse ways. <TS>As for me, I think that students should be given one long vacation each year.</TS> There are two reasons that make my view convingcing. This is because long vacation allow students to make enough money for thier tuition and to do what they want.</IN>

I will take an example of my experiances related to this.</EX> When I did part time job to deliver the flied chicken, I could made the same amount money for tuition for two months. Had I done part time job for a month or less, I could hardly earned enough money.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, long vacation provide students with the opportunity to do what they want.</MI2> <SI2>During semester, it is hard to spend the time for what students want to do, for students need to spend their time to do a lot of assignments. <TR>However</TR>, during long vacation, they can do a variety of things such as going abroad to learng foreign language and trip around the country. <TR>For an example</TR>, during last winter vacation, for two and half months, I visited New York in the United State, and I can not forget the exciting memories.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all</TR>, I am of the statement that students should have long vacation. There are a lot of details to consider, but I believe that there is no substitute for earning money to pay tuition and enjoying their own time. That why I insist that students should be given one long vacation each year.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, we can decrease the traffic jam using public transportation.</MI1> <SI1><EX>For example, one train carries several hundreds of people. If they ride their own cars not using the train, the road will become busier than before and, the traffic jam will become more terrific. Since i have no my own car, i go to university by bus everyday. As i go there, i always see so many cars which is filling the road.

Some people would agree that borrowing money influence the friendship in a negative way, while others would disagree with it. <TS>As far as I am concerned, I am one of those who support the first view point for the following two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, borrowing money will hurt the friendship. <TR>Second</TR>, when borrowing money, you feel uncomfortable with your friend.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, if you lend money to your friend, the relationship between you and the friend may break up.</MI1> <SI1>It is generally said that something related to money is likely to estrange you from your friend. Unless your friend pay the money back on time, you will have a difficulty in sustaining the relationship with the friend. <TR>In fact</TR>, when lending money to your friend, you might lose not only the money but also your friend. <EX>For example, when I was in university, I shared the dorm with my friend, who was nice and good natured person.

not wait any more, so our friendship was destroyed. <TR>As a result</TR>, lending money was the source of this trouble.</SI1></BO1>

Many of them seem difficult, and even impossible. <TS><TR>However</TR>, only after surmounting them successfully, as most people agrees, they become really helpful ones.</TS> I strongly agree to this idea, because there is a feeling that doubles as the tasks become more difficult, and because, through overcoming the barrier, people can find that their ""true"" limits are still beyond those what they previously thought to be.</IN>

<BO1><MI1>Through getting over difficult experiences, people can feel sense of success, which increases their exultation.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In particular</TR>, if they are what others couldn't have done so far, such emotion will be even greater. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, people who gave up the ""impossible"" job easily, will usually repent about the surrender over and over. <EX>For example, a Korean weight-lifter who succeeded in setting the new world record, would probably experienced a great deal of hardship before this moment.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Another factor</TR> that success in difficult jobs make people learn something will be continuous breakthroughs.</MI2> <SI2><TR>Actually</TR>, it is said by many psychologists that the ""true"" limits are way beyond the points where people find it ""difficult"" to make it.

Different countries or societies have different cultures respectively, <TR>However</TR>, with the development of the technology, people are now more quick to learn and experience other cultures. <TS><TR>Therefore</TR>, I strongly agree with the statement that modern technology is creating single world culture based on the following reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, development of the transportation has helped various cultures to put together.</MI1> <SI1> With the invention of modern transportation facilities, such as an airplane, people are now quick to see and experience other nation's cultures. This can be easily understood with the example of Mcdonald, the biggest fast food restaurant in the world. Mcdonald has now more than 30,000 stores throughout the world. They deliver all the same burgers and other products to their foreign stores by air, and within a day, those products will reach the respective stores. People can taste the BigMc, the main burger which Mcdonald produces, in any place in the world. In this way, they are creating single 'food' culture, where food is also one of the most important features of any culture.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, the unification of different cultures is being accelerated through the growth of the communication means, especially through the Internet.</MI2> <SI2> By surfing the Internet, one can read and see various news being happening anywhere in the world. Different music of different countries are transmitted to other countries, and not to mention movies. <TR>Moreover</TR>, through on-line chatting program, one can talk to another, who's a thousands miles away, asking how they live, what they eat and all other cultural things that he may want to know. The same rule exists in case of various media tools, as different cultures are being introduced to other cultures through them. National Geography, a TV program which introduces various cultures throughout the world, can be one good example for this.</SI2></BO2>

It is true to say that cultures have been compared and enjoyed all together, not by any one's personal purpose, but for people's natural desires to feel something different.</CO>

As teachers generally have so many students to care about and are usually under pressure on their own tasks besides teaching, they tend to be indifferent to each student’s need despite their efforts. <TR>On the contrary to this</TR>, parents’ love for their own children is unlimited and their enthusiasm for right education of their children is not exhausting.</SI1></BO1>

From babyhood to adulthood, parents always remain our sincere teachers.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, the reason that our parents can be our best teachers is that children resemble their parents, thus making it possible for parents to understand what are children’s strength and weakness both in personality and intelligent capability.</MI3> <SI3> Through their intuition as well as consistent observation they can be the best teachers to have a full understanding about us.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, students can select area of study other then their majors from more alternatives in large universities than in smaller ones.</MI2> <SI2> Compared with smaller universities, many large universities have more ""minor"" courses, which are acknowledged as credits of upper levels, i.e. junior and senior, which means that students of the latter ones have more alternative choices of studies than the former ones.

Some people have a negative opinion about this, <TS><TR>However</TR>, I believe that pets are worthy of spending lots of time on them.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Pets can be our unexampled friends for us, especially old people or a person who lives alone.

If they have a pet such as a cat or a dog, they feel like someone is waiting for me at home, and less lonely. That somebody is delighted to see me whenever I come into the house is very blessed. Even though I'm live alone, I always look forward to seeing my puppet doing cute things whenever I enter my house. Then people can talk to them as if the pet can talk to us. Though the pets can't speak, we feel like with a falily member by talking to them, and I actually believe that my puppet is my sister.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, having pets is good for children.</MI1> <SI1> A person's characteristic is formed in his or her early age. By communicating with other people, children learn how to interact with others. <TR>However</TR>, parents may be very busy even at home, and children can not always be with their friends. <TR>In that case</TR>, pets can play an important role for the children. When children can talk to their pets something, they learn how to say in a specific situation such as ""don't have it"", ""come on and let's play with me"", etc. Children can also learn how the animals are close to human, and how to take care pets which are considered weaker than themselves. They'll learn how to love others.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Other reasons</TR> are that people can get a lot of good personalities and ability to do the work efficiently.</MI2> <SI2> One of the personalities people can get is cooperation. <EX>For example, if one person does the work alone without getting help from and even giving help to other people, s/he is likely to be isolated, and even ignored by others. To survive in a society well, s/he will cooperate with other people. <TR>Also</TR>, people can get the work done effectively because there’s a kind of competition in a society. If one person uses a new technique in a company, his/her co-workers will also use it to get a high status, <TR>in other words</TR>, win others there. They will try their best to develop themselves.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, some people might prefer to do the work alone because of several reasons like that they like a quiet place where they can concentrate well, but doing in groups provides you with a lot of advantages I talked about above. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I want you to work together in groups to have a better life.</CO>

Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.,::,"<IN>Most of the children grow up in the big city because there are many institutes, hospitals, and schools. Some parents want to bring up their children in the big city because of these, while others want to live in the countryside. <TS>I agree that countryside is better for bring up children than in the big city.</TS> Children in the country can be friends of nature and learn unselfishness, collaboration and so on from small community.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, nature is the best teacher for children.</MI1> <SI1> In these days, children rarely have an opportunity to meet and understand wild nature. <TR>However</TR>, countryside offers them peaceful, generous, and beautiful characters of nature.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a good neighbor should have care for others in order not to do damage toward his neighbors.</MI1> <SI1><EX>For example, sometimes we can not sleep or have enough rest because of the sound of playing piano which is played by next door's young children.

<BO1><MI1>We can always enjoy ourselves regardless of the condition of climate if we are inside for our leisure activities.</MI1> <SI1>It is apparent that weather changes without any caution and notice.

It is obvious that both are not exactly the same, <TR>However</TR>, we could easily find some similar characteristics. <TS>Both of them not only need strategies and plans to win but also have rules that organize themselves.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>When we play a game, we use to work out strategies and make plans to win before we start the game.</MI1> <SI1>It is very similar to our lives. Suppose we are playing soccer and you are the coach of a team who obviously wants to win a victory. Before the game starts, you, the coach, come to decide each player’s position according to the strength of the other side , and then work on a specific strategy to win the coming game. <TR>Likewise</TR>, we plan our lives before we do something in order to get the best result.

<BO2><MI2><TR>More importantly</TR>, a game also has its own rules.</MI2> <SI2>Living in these current society, we cannot disobey lots of rules including laws as even a violation can cause dreadful results. What if murder occurs in a society that murder is prohibited? What if most people do not keep tax laws so that tax evasions ordinarily happen? It would drive our society into catastrophe. While playing soccer, we should keep the rules that the game has ,such as handling, not only to win the game but also to last the game itself. It is apparent that each member should keep the rules both in our lives and in the games.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>Taken together</TR>, playing a game is very similar to living a life, especially in terms of rules that exist and strategies that is needed to win and succeed. It may be not optional but essential to get the best result in our lives and in the game we play. We should keep in mind that the rules in our society must be obeyed for our society itself.</CO>

"983&It has been said, “Not everything that is learned is contained in books.” Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?",::,"<IN>There are different opinions concerning whether knowledge gained from experience is more crucial than that contained in books. Each of them has diverse advantage, respectively. <TS>In this essay, I will make a comparison between these two ways of obtaining knowledge, and then I will mention my preference.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>In the case of learning by experience, that bestows vivid and unforgettable knowledge to us.</MI1> <SI1> We learn many ways to need our life throughout the activities of the school and other places. <EX>For example, we acquire knowledge, such as how to get along with friends, how to fall in love and get marry, or how to overcome failures.</EX> We may read the ways in books, but they are not always suitable and adaptable means about all cases. We will acquire the best ways in case by case throughout our own experience. They are practicable knowledge. <TR>Also</TR>, direct experience is not forgotten readily. In my case, I had learned swimming in elementary school. Though haven't some chances to learn after that, I remember the way of swimming and enjoy that. <TR>Finally</TR>, knowledge learned by experience is important in that it offers unforgettable memories and lively lessons.</SI1></BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the other hand</TR>, books help us to obtain the diverse advantages direct experience cannot give.</MI2> <SI2><TR>First</TR>, learning from books is allowed to have numerous chances with little cost and time compare with experience. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, we want to know something about the moon such as its shape, environment, and organism.</EX> It is difficult for us to travel there and to inquire what we want to know. <TR>But</TR>, if only buy or borrow books, we can spot the answers using minimum money and time. <TR>Second</TR>, books make surreal things to realize. <TR>In actually</TR>, we are not able to meet great men of the past such as statesmen, artists, and scientists and so on before the invention of a time machine. <TR>However</TR>, throughout books, we can meet and talk with them and feel and know their thinking. <TR>Third</TR>, books play a cardinal role to reduce the rate of mistakes. Imagine go to travel a certain place where we haven't ever gone. As long as have information about there, we will make less mistakes and enjoy the travel.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Books and experience are both prominent ways for us to learn and gain knowledge.

<BO1>If somebody asks us to do something on the moment we want to do it voluntarily, most of people feel that they suddenly lose the interest in that. <MI1>This is because, I believe, we can do our best to do something only when that is chosen by ourselves, not by others's askings or suggestions.</MI1> <SI1>Imagine that going to the class is a requirement. students who do not want it may attend the class,but they easily do other things like reading books or writing letters to their freinds.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, reason to support my opinion is, life is consisted of countless of competitions as games are.</MI1> <SI1> There should be losers and winners in the life and games. Especially in the modern world, we can’t avoid any kinds of competition. When our mothers had us - which is the most strict competition - just one sperm out of billions could combine with an egg. Once we were born, we have to struggle to achieve goals in our life and competitions are the must-have. <TR>Similarly</TR>, when we see the worldcup game, only 26 soccer players out of thousands in the country has to beat <TR>Another</TR>, country team.

You need to communicate with other players so that you can stop all the balls from your rival players and there should be other outstanding players to make your team the best. Life is same.

1001&Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific details and examples in your answer.,::,"<IN>Universities offer a lot of classes but some students don't join classes even if they are major-related courses. While others do not miss a class though it is an optional course. It is, of course, true that there is a right to attend classes by students' own will, but I think university students must join classes. Because attending class is the most important activity of university and most students want to communicate with their classmates about critical issues of the courses.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, classes in universities should be mandatory to all students because classes are not only simple procedures of education but also core activities of university life.</MI1> <SI1>This means that every student should attend classes for sharing their experiences, discussing one <TR>Another</TR>, and expand their scope of minds. <TR>Therefore</TR>, no other activities of a university, like sports, clubs and bands, can be replaced for classes.

I think that a right to join classes is a privilege of university students and they should not throw it away.</CO>

Some people may argue that one long vacation is more reasonable. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I hold a view that several short vacations are more efficient and profitable than one long vacation because several short vacations make it possible to enjoy four seasons fully, and relieve much stress timely.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>More than anything else</TR>, we can enjoy our four seasons during many short vacations.</MI1> <SI1>In my country, South Korea, there are four seasons, spring, summer, fall, and winter.
