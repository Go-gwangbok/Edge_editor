If people want to run a small business in physical space, they probably have to consider a lot of expensive stuffs including real-estate so that they can afford them. In the case of business in cyber space, however, one of the most prominent cognitive objections is about their computer skills. Financial status might be second thing.

Most kids start school at around age 7 and then go to school for the next 12-16 years. The point is that they will be in school for a long, long time.

That¡¯s why children should spend their time playing than studying at an early age. Children would be much healthier, psychologically, if they could just play freely during their early years.

The best way of take steps is to enhance our abilities to make a quick decision, namely, to discipline ourselves to grow up intuition that is based on our experiences because this method can provide us with a chance to avoid the emergency and to yield better consequences. </CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,"The first body paragraph was fine, but the second one was much lacking in information in comparison, making it seem like it was purposefully being minimized.",//"230&In some countries, teeangers have jobs while they are still students, Do you think this is a good idea?

I agree with this point of view for two reasons: <TR>First</TR>, since friends don¡¯t write down agreements when they make loans, confusion can later result about the terms of loan and its repayment. <TR>And second</TR>, friends often have trouble communicating frankly if a debt isn¡¯t repaid promptly, and problems in the friendship can result.</TS></IN><BO1><MI1>Lack of documentation is the beginning of serious problems between the two friends.</MI1> <SI1>Few friends would ever think of writing down the terms of a loan when one friend loans money to another. The advantage of having the terms of a loan written down is that both parties clearly in understand the amount involved, the time when it will be repaid, any interest to be paid, and any penalty for late payment. Without such a piece of paper it is often the case that the person loaning money expects the loan to be repaid in a short time but the person who received the loan believes he can wait a long time. Without a written agreement, the two people may have very different understandings of the terms of the loan. This misunderstandings can lead to problems that may seriously damage the friendship.</SI1></BO1><BO2><MI2><TR>Besides</TR>, friends often find it awkward to communicate frankly if a debt isn¡¯t repaid promptly, and damage to the friendship may result.</MI2> <SI2>It sometimes happens that when someone loans money to a friend and the loan isn¡¯t repaid promptly, the person who loaned money may want or need his money back quickly and feels frustrated when his loan is not repaid. <TR>However</TR>, because of the friendships, the person may hesitate to frankly ask his friend for quickly repayment. Instead of communicating openly, the person may allow resentment and anger to build up, day after day, until he begins having very negative feelings about his friend.

It is because we can do almost everything we want and we can get almost everything we want to purchase by spending money.
