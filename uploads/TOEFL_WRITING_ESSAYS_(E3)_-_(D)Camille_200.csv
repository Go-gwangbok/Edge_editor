Do you agree or diagree with the following statement? Being happy with a job is more important than having a high salary. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>Sometimes children or students say to their parents. "" I like music/art! I love it! I want to be a musician/artist! "" , but most parents only say that study is the most important thing. <TS>Yes, it is correct that study is very important. However, can we live happily although we have a high salary job that you don't like? I don't think so.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, if we have a job that we don't like, our lives will be bad. Because, we have to do it although we hate that.</MI1> <SI1>For only high salary. More importantly, we had better live our lives happily. I know that having good jobs are hard, but if we have jobs that we like, although it gives a low salary we can live our lives happily! Isn't it more great than get a high salary? To illustrate, some people have high salary jobs and live unhappily although they like music or art more.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, If we get our jobs that we like, there is more effectiveness.</MI2> <SI2>What i mean is, if we like its jobs, we can get more high effectiveness.<TR> For example</TR>, people can do well and get more efectiveness if they like those works.</SI2></BO2>

government should not fund in art.,::,"<IN><TS>The reading passage contends that government should not fund a lot of money in art. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, the speaker bring up several points that contradict this argument.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the lecturer argues that art plays a significan role in citizens’ entertainment.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, The art have to be shared by many people for their entertainment. It is obvious that people do not complain about the tax money caused by creating public parks. This means that people will actively participate in several art activities without any complaint. <TR>Thus</TR>, art will contribute to safe environment for people. This casts doubt on the reading, which states that the money which is spent on art activities or programs need to be used to better safeguard the nation.</BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, according to the speaker, censorship problem can be avoided by a panel system run by experts who are not involved in any political party.</MI2> <SI2> They grant awards or support artists accoring to their true talent. This refutes the reading passage’s assertion that governments will make censorship for funding artists who has political philosophy that is related to the governments’.</SI2></BO2>
 
<BO3><MI3>The final point made by the lecturer is that companies do not fund in the art that is not profitable.</MI3> <SI3>Although many film industries are sponsorded by many advertisement enterprises, there are art fields that do not make a lot of money. <TR>Moreover</TR>, we need to keep in mind that art programs for children are necessary. Various kinds of art programs and activities will benefit children. This rebuffs the reading passage’s argument that art can already funded by advertising industry, so it does not make sense.</BO3>",::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"This is an excellent essay!

Teachers should not make their social and political views known to students in the classroom.,::,"<IN>Some people say that teachers should not make their social and political views known to students in the classroom. <TS>But I disagree with the statement in that the teacher’s opinion about the social and political situation can give the right point of views to the students and raise the degree of the attention by the classroom students.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, teacher’s opinions about the specific social and political situation can bring up the student’s awareness about their society.</MI1> <SI1>Since teachers already had lived longer than the students, they can tell the right thing about the societal situation and the specific political event. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I read the report from Korea Education Development Institute which is about the relation between the teacher’s private view saying about the certain political event and the student’s right point of views about that event. The students had more accurate awareness about that political event if they heard the teacher’s opinion about that.</EX></SI1><BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, if teachers speak to students their social and political views, the students would more concentrate on the class.</MI2> <SI2>This is because the textbook itself is largely boring and hard for students to study for a long without distracting their attention. In that situation, if teacher tell their views to the students they can focus on the textbook. <EX></TR>For example,</TR> when I was high school student, I hardly concentrate on the class while the teacher read the textbook. When teacher started to talk about his own view about the social and political event in those days such as voting for president, I could more attend the class. I heard later that was true with my classmates too.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, teacher’s opinion about the social and political event can give the right point of views and raise the degree of the attention by students.

Government should spend more on improving the internet access instead of transportation for people.,::,"<IN>There has been debate on whether the government should invent more on the internet or public transportation. Using internet has been essential part of one’s life. People use internet for study, work and play. Some people state that government should spend more money on improving internet environment instead of transportation. While the transportation is important for people,<TS> I agree that it is better for government to invest more on the internet. More people will take advantages from internet and it will highly improve efficiency in life.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many people will obtain benefit from allowing more access to the internet.</MI1> <SI1>There are more people are using the internet than using public transportation. According to recent survey conducted by newspaper in Korea, majority of people responded that they can not live without internet. People found it very useful to search any information on the internet. Reading newspaper and watching audio clips are what people enjoy doing in their free time. This means that internet is more significant for people than public transportation nowadays Furthermore government should consider spending money very carefully and not waste invaluable taxes paid by people. Accordingly it allows government to invest money more effectively.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, using internet improve efficiency in work and study.</MI2> <SI2>Computer with internet is necessary for employees and students. Each employee is provided with personal computer to use internet in the workplace. They can communicate by e-mail and search for information on the internet. According to economist magazine in Korea, the company can save general expenses by using internet. It usually costs high in communicating with companies in overseas by telephone and post mail. This will lead to higher profits for company as well as employees. For students, they can search information by the internet. There is ample information available on the internet. Internet is highly recommended resource for studying. Therefore students can save their time for visiting library. Consequently improving more access to the internet will improve people’s life.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, I believe that government should spend more on improving the internet access instead of transportation for people. Government have right to spend money effectively in the field where more people can obtain benefit from, which is the internet.

대기업에 취업하는게 낫다.(It is better to be an employee in big companies than in small comapnies),::,"<IN>Many people think large companies are much better than small ones because they offer more salary and opportunities to develop employees. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, other people argue that small companies is preferable to large ones. They believe that these companies usually pay attention to their workers more. <TS><TR>However</TR>,<TR> in my opinion</TR>, large companies is more effective approach for the bright future. This is because I don't need to be worried about losing my job as much as I am in small ones and there is greater opportunity to grow as an individual.</TS></IN>
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, as most of large companies have much more funds set aside in order to handle economic recession wisely, they normally provide better job security.</MI1> <SI1>One of recent studies conducted by the Ministry of Labor, when nation's economy was in slow, small corporations went out of the business three times higher than large ones. It demonstrate my opinion that workers in large ones can perform their duties with less concerns for loosing their jobs.</SI1></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, there is more chances to grow as an individual.</MI2> <SI2>Large companies give labors incredibly variety investments including free tickets for gym, chance to go abroad and so on.

High schools should require all students to wear school uniforms.,::,"<IN>Many people believe that schools should allow students to choose what they want to wear to school in terms of respecting their personality. <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with the idea. <TS><TR>In my opinion</TR>, students should wear school uniforms in high schools because wearing uniforms is advantageous to their financial as well as learning.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, wearing uniforms helps students save a large amount of money.</MI1> <SI1>It is because they don't need to buy a variety of clothes. Especially, since teenagers are easily affected by friends and fashion, they would like to buy expensive clothes or brand new products. This will make students waste their money on buying useless clothes. <TR>Moreover,</TR> it would be heavy burden for poor students to buy several clothes and some students would feel a sense of incongruity. <EX>In my personal experience, I should have worn a school uniform for two years in high school. Since I spent most of my time on studying in school, I don't need other divers clothes but just a pair of school uniform and a spare one. When I was university students, I realized that wearing school uniforms was absolutely economical. Then, I should have spent a large amount of money on buying my clothes every season.</EX> This experience shows that wearing uniforms is helpful for household economy by decreasing expenditure for buying clothes.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> putting on uniforms is a good way for students to concentrate on study.</MI2> <SI2>It is due to that they don't need to think about what to wear to school. This concern would make students spend much time on choosing their clothes everyday. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, some clothes may not be suitable when students study in class because too showy designs or colors would be many distractions for both other students and teachers. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, school uniforms tend to be designed considering calming and relaxing color. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my younger sister go to a high school where allows students to wear what they want. She spend much time on choosing clothes in order to look better before going to school. Sometimes she used to be late for school when it takes far long time to pick her clothes. But, until last year when she went to a middle school wearing the school uniform, she rarely had been late for school.</EX> This illustration shows that wearing uniforms helps students to more focus on study than their appearance.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In brief</TR>, requiring school uniforms is more beneficial for students to save money and to study.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN>Some people believe that TV makes family spend a time together and gave us great opportunity to communicate with our friends. <TR>However</TR>, </TR>in my opinion</TR>, <TS>TV makes our communication breake down. This is because we lost our time to talk with our family in front of TV and we can spend a time alone if we have TV.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, TV prevent family to talk and concern each other.</MI1> <SI1>TV makes us focus on TV show and we just spend a time to watch the programs in TV, not to have a concern about family's conditions and life. <TR>For example</TR>, there is a study that is conducted by Seoul National University in 2000. There is two groups, the room where first group is has TV, the other group didn't have TV for 1 week. After 1 week, they have a interview and some quiz about their members who they live together for one week. The result is that first group couldn't answer question about the other member in their group whereas, second group could tell the right about their members. This study prove that TV makes people reduce their conversation and not have a focus on their family.</SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, TV dimish desire to meet another people.</MI2> <SI2>Watching TV don't need to be with another person. We could be alone and people will not find a friend who can talk with and get rid of our loneness if we have TV. That makes people solitude from society. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there is documentary about HIKICOMORI that means the person who don't want to come out to the world even their house yield and just stay in their room for a year or more years. They spend a lot of time in their room with their private computer and their TV. Some part of HIKICOMORI has problem with their mind illness but some part of them think they don't need a person and friends because they don't feel a loneness and boring with TV. </EX>Although it is a extremly example, we can understand and admit that TV contribute to make wall between person and person.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO> <TR>To sum up</TR>, TV gives a damage to have a conversation between familys and makes person think like that they don't need connection and communication with friends and family. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I believe strongly TV is not helpful to maintain family's and friend's communication and relation at all.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,This is a very good essay!

"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of the Internet, students can learn more effectively. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN>One of the most innovative technologies is the Internet in the twenty-first century. People can’t think their daily lives without using the Internet nowadays. Although the use of Internet makes modern people convenient, it can’t be convinced that the Internet is always helpful for their lives. <TS>Among the controversial issues with the technology, students’ use for learning is a more serious problem because of unnecessarily enormous data and the seduction of entertainment with it.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, there is insignificant information to make decision hard.</MI1> <SI1>In the beginning of searching data, students are happy to get a lot of information from the Internet because it’s accessible and massive. <TR>However</TR>, when the students start organizing with the data that found from the Internet, they would realize that it’s not simple to cut down the waste of data and reconstitute the data to useful reports. Also, the reports that mainly based on the information from the Internet miss sometimes the core of the topic or include shallow depth of details. Most professors blame student’s essays with similar information and express the difficulties of marking the stale reports. That is, the convenience of studying steals the opportunities of researching and thinking about the subject from the students.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, the Internet environment interferes with concentrating in study.</MI2> <SI2>Even though students access the Internet for the purpose of study, they can easily be tempted by entertainments such as games and web-surfing.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to do one project completely and then begin to do another project than to do multiple projects simultaneously.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not it is better to do one project totally and then start to do another project than to do multiple projects concurrently. This answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. <TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR>, <TS>I firmly believe that doing multiple projects at the same time is better.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <TR>First</TR>, one can save time by doing many projects at once. <TR>Second</TR>, people can widen view of their jobs.<IN>
 
 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people can significantly reduce time by doing multiple projects concurrently.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that when people spend much of their time in doing a lot of projects simultaneously, people are likely to focus on their works. <TR>Moreover,</TR> concentrating on their works enhance one’s work efficiency. <TR>For example</TR>, there had been a study conducted by Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand businessmen to see if doing several works at a time is effective. Of all, 86.2 percent of them stated that this practice is significantly advantageous because they can save a lot of time to work. <TR>For this reason</TR>, Samsung Company requires job candidates having the ability to do manifold projects simultaneously. The company argues that the ability gives employees and owner the chance to have more free time as well as enhance the profit of outputs. <TR>As a result</TR>, doing various projects concurrently is better for people as they can save a lot of time.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, doing manifold jobs concurrently allows one to broaden view of his or her careers.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that people have to search much information and meet many different people in order to process numerous works simultaneously. <TR>Moreover,</TR> these actions make them get much knowledge and enhance their own social skills, leading to be successful in their career life. According to an article, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor at Harvard University in America claimed: “In today’s society, companies have to encourage their employees to do many projects at the same time. This is because when they do their many jobs concurrently, they can progress their ability to work. It is obvious that they essentially meet many experts and search much information. <TR>Thus</TR>, through these practice, job employees can have the chance to be promoted as well as widen view of their jobs.” <TR>Hence</TR>, it is helpful to do multiple works at once.</SI2></BO2>
 
<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, processing numerous projects at the same time can improve work efficiency.</MI3> <SI3>This is due to the fact that processing just monotonous one project can wear people out of originality and drain enthusiasm. <TR>Thus</TR>, taking adequate amount of investing in doing manifold projects at a once can recharge energy and make them concentrating better on their tasks. <TR>For example</TR>, there had been a study by conducted by Columbia University in America. The researchers surveyed two thousands of professors who having jobs in America to see if doing several works concurrently is helpful. Of all, 87.2 percent of them stated that this action makes them more energetic and focus more on their tasks. This is because they continuously think about their projects and make profits, and then they do not have to need waste time on draining their enthusiasm. <TR>Therefore</TR>, doing various projects simultaneously is effective.</BO3>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two of my rationales mentioned above. <TR>Once again</TR>, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my standpoints above are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoint of a majority who are in favor of my claim.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,"Another good essay.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>In a society where education arouses never-before interest from teachers and parents alike, there are incessant debates on who is the best teacher to a child. <TS>I believe that parents are the best teachers and following are the reasons to support my opinion.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, unlike the past where teachers were the ultimate well-educated people in the past, the average academic qualifications of parents have risen in the past few decades.</MI1> <SI1>Parents are now equally knowledgeable and have as much access to plethora of information as the teachers when it comes to the child's education. Though experience and expertise are the differentiation factors of teachers, parents are no more negligible nor ignorant of what is good for their child.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, parents spend more time with their child than anybody else during the childhood.</MI2> <SI2>This makes parents the ultimate influencer during the crucial years of the child's development. The child, with innate tendency to mimic their parents' thoughts, words, actions and behavior, will naturally learn them from whoever they spend most time with.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Last</TR>, teachers do not exert as much influence as the parents do.</MI3> <SI3>Even with the increasing teacher to student ratio in class, it is not simple for the teachers to pay undivided, individual attention to each student. <TR>Additionally</TR>, the student's behavior may vastly differ in classroom to their normal behaviors outside. It it therefore crucial for the parents to observe their child and reprimand them whenever necessary.</SI3></BO3>

a teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than the ability to give knowledge.,::,"<IN>Nowadays, many people think that student education is getting more important. For this reason, some people said that teacher’s ability to give their knowledge to their student is good judge to teacher. <TS><TR>However</TR> I think that the ability of relationship with student is more important than just teaching them.</TS> There are several reasons, first, if teacher wants to make student absorbs all of knowledge which was given from teacher, there have to be basement of relationship. Also teacher teaches not only knowledge in the books but some invisible things such as friendship, love, brave, kind and so on. <TR>Therefore</TR> teacher needs to relate skill with student than to give their knowledge.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teacher need relationship skill with student because, even though a teacher has perfect capacity of giving knowledge if the teacher is not friendly with student, student might feel uncomfortable so they could not get 100% of what teacher want to teach.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was middle school student, my teacher was sick so another teacher came to my class. At that time, somehow I could not concentrate on his class because he did not really matter students characters so we could not make good relationship and neither I did not understand what he would like to teach.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, teacher can teach more in relationship than in a book.</MI2> <SI2>School is no longer just a teaching place.

It means teacher’s ability of relationship make students have much better experience which is not only good memory but good learning in life. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my 6 grade elementary school teacher had huge enthusiasm and nice capacity of relationship with students.

개인이 환경문제에 도움(Some people think individuals can do nothing about environmental issues. Do you agree with the idea?),::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether individuals can do nothing about environmental issues. The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. <TR>Thus</TR> the jury may still be out,<TR> but as far as I am concerned</TR>, <TS>I agree with the given statement. </TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoints as follows.</IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it is so complicated that individuals can do nothing when it comes to environmental issues.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, the issues are out of the field that a person can deal with. <EX><TR>For illustration</TR>, citing the most disastrous natural disaster happened in Haiti, when the tsunami hit Haiti, the people living there could not do anything about it. This is because, it, the disaster, was so enormous for individual or even people there to take care of. <TR>Therefore</TR>, they had no choice but asked for national wide helps. Ranging from the United States from Canada, all the way through some European Countries, they flew all the way to Haiti where the natural disaster hit not only to rescue the wounded people but also to help the tragic city. Although it took tremendous times to renovate the city completely, the folks in Haiti said that it would have been impossible, if other countries, NGOs or social companies had not have helped us. Given this context, such huge natural disaster cannot be solved without national-wide helps.</EX><TR> Additionally</TR>, for example, the lack of water supply has been one of the serious environmental problems in the world. Saving water, as an individual-level, cannot be a substitute to release the problem because the shortage of water supply has been happening nationally and naturally, so all the environmental labs and the governments have to get together to solve it such as through building a dam which is out of individual’s ability. <TR>In this regard</TR>, the natural disasters are hard for individual’s endeavor to handle with.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, since the environmental issues are enormous, the individual’s help or endeavor is not compared with world-wide rescues.</MI2>  <SI2><TR>Differently put</TR>, a person’s help is hard to reach the national level or governmental level helps. <TR>For illustration</TR>, sometimes, developing countries, the governments, are unable to help themselves and their population, because of the financial hardships or the system. They need to get helped from the developed countries or national NGOs. Otherwise, they will be overwhelmed about handling all the tragedies all by themselves. <TR>In addition</TR>, the charities through the whole world can actually help the developing countries where have the environment-issues. With the monetary helps, they will be able to directly take care of the population attacked by the disaster and make the broken city better. In this respect, the worlds-wide helps such as the financial helps from the whole world are able to rescue the wounded countries by the natural disasters.</SI2></BO2>

According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2010, there was a significant difference between two groups of people when they were given a task to learn some specific expert knowledge: Group A was required to search for it through the Internet, while Group B was required to find out it only through book in a library. Interestingly, the average amount of time that people in Group A spent to master the knowledge was 47 percent shorter than that of the latter group. This implies that the Internet allows today’s people to learn anything more quickly and become educated more easily.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>A further cause why I am of the same opinion with the aforesaid explanation is that our society will become more and more the competitive environment.</MI2> <SI2>With the progress of our society, the number of favorite jobs would relatively be limited in spite of increasing population. So the competitive society could make us to become more educated person. <TR>For example</TR>, it is easier to become teacher 20 years ago. </TR>However</TR>, nowadays it is very difficult to get a job at the school due to more competitors. <TR>Therefore</TR>, this competition could cause person to become more well-known person.</BO2>

<CO>Based on what was previously conferred, we may conclusively claim that it is difficult to learn information in the past than in the present. It is because we can find some information conveniently and the competitive society could make us to become more educated person. <TR>All in all</TR>, I personally believe that my rationales above are convincing enough to represent the view points of the majoring of people who are in favor of my claim.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,"This is a very good essay!

In order to stay well informed ppl should get information from various news sources.,::,"<IN>There have been several heated debates whether individuals should receive information from different sources. Some people may disagree with this, while others may deem otherwise. <TS>Still I believe it is necessary to get variety of information as it will enrich our understanding of the world and think from different perspectives.</TS> In this regard from I side with the statement above.</IN>
    
<BO1><MI1>The first reason for my opinion that can be seen by everyone is that reading various news sources enable subscribers to perceive and think from a different point of a view.</MI1> <SI1>Individual press has its own color and characteristic. There are newspaper companies which tend to be conservative while others are progressive. That is why they write same story but from different perspective. Some editors publish the same incident from a right wing stance while others may from a left wing perspective. So due to this there can be two different stories when it is actually dealing same one story. <EX>To take this into illustration, Venezuela’s president Chavez has long been criticized by world media as a ruthless dictator. <TR>However,</TR> according to some of the left wing media he has sponsored the poor children by providing cheap oil which I have never heard or read before. So if I have only read conservative newspaper I would have only thought President Chavez as a dictator while he maybe is benign and kind president.</EX> In this token we need to check out the different kinds of newspaper.</SI1></BO1>
  
<BO2><MI2>Another crucial reason for my argument is that by reading different news coverage we can grasp every single detail happening around the world. </MI2> <SI2>Not every news covers all incidents as some event may be less important than others. <TR>As a result</TR>, people are likely to miss out if they read only one or types of news coverage. That is why readers should also sometime check out the local news paper and tabloids as well. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, last week there was a big fire festival at our town. I was not aware of that as I was not exposed to the local newspaper. <TR>Unfortunately</TR>, no one reminded me of this festival that I spent the night by myself in my room watching TV.</EX> Likewise in order not to miss the all the events it would be necessary to subscribe the local news as well.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Subsequent to mulling over this query, there is no doubt that statement given above is true.
Each of the press report the news from different point of views and each deal different incidents.

Higher education should be available only to good students. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.,::,"<IN>When people calculate national competiveness, one of the criteria for judging is the education. It is based on detailed specialization such as the quality of education and the rate of graduating school. Even though it is not clear to express the effect of education numerically, there are some indicators relevant to economy and culture in our society. <TS><TR>Therefore</TR>, the thought that higher education is only demanded to smart students is controversial from the following reasons.</TS></IN>   
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, students should have equal opportunities to find their talents.</MI1> <SI1>Everyone has different talents, and young people discovery their gifts and interests in different time. Some chance on their special skills in early ages, so they spend time to develop them in high school and college; <TR>however</TR>, the others don’t know about their aptitude until taking higher education.  That is, if the late discoverer didn’t take the education, he or she might never find it and have an awkward job that isn’t joyful. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my cousin wasn’t interested in any subjects in high school, but he realized he found that he was good at statistics while taking part in a subsidiary class of his university. Now, he is an economist and is passionate on his job.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, higher education helps our society healthier.</MI2> <SI2>In school life, students learn not only information of my subjects, but also have a chance to achieve their goals. The students try to get good marks on their quizzes trivially. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, they strive to get a good university or get a better job. In this process, students learn their own desires, and the way how to move to their dreams. When people succeed on their goal, they lead a successful life. Eventually, the people who know the happiness of the effort make the society sound. <TR>For instance</TR>, uneducated people tend to commit crimes more than high educated people.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To summarize</TR>,higher education should be equally given to everyone because the opportunity of education is the chance of researching aptitudes and the train of social sound members.

Other people think that the primary role of teacher is to equip students with knowledges. This is because the prime purpose of the school is to transfer knowledge to them. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>in my opinion</TR>, teachers should put a much more effort and time to take care of their students to become better person in various aspects including knowledge. </TS>It offers great chances for students to get higher grades and develop their social skills.</IN>
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, if a teacher tries to focus on making students better person in many aspects rather than imparting knowledge to them, they will be able to get better grades.</MI1> <SI1>People are likely to place more effort to meet the expectation of people who care for them.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, I think it is a good way to develop their social skills.</MI2> <SI2>Teacher normally acts as motivator.

If he had also focused only to equip us with knowledge, I cannot live with others very well.</EX></SI2></BO2>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, parents expend a plenty of time with their kid.</MI1> <SI1>After the kids was born, parents naturally breed them, protect not to hurt from a sharp stuff or eat harmful thing.

"Parents should give mone to their children for high grades they get at school

   <BO1><MI1>The first reason for my opinion that can be seen by everyone is that prizing pupils with some cash can stimulate them to focus better.</MI1> <SI1>Some may argue that financial reward can affect children to seek for more money and disturb the moral as well. Though, such argument has a point, I am assured that giving money is a good ways to let students to study harder. To enable students to start studying they need strong motivation. It is rare for young kids get immersed in their study and enjoy doing it. Usually, they prefer to play video game or to watch TV. <TR>However,</TR> young kids are simple-minded that with small amount of cash it can stimulate. <EX>According to the recent study done at Oxford University about 80% of top students were getting award for high test mark and about half of those rewarded students were getting extra pocket money. This study illustrates how beneficial it is to grant money to hard working students.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI1>Another crucial reason for my argument is that by providing money, children are more likely to find which field of study they want to major in.</MI1> <SI1>Most students these days do not know which major they should study. Even the numerous high school students does not decide between the study of humanity or the natural science. This is because they have never experienced what kind of field they are amused with.

Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in modern apartment building?",::,"<IN>Since 1990, man y apartments have been constructed here and there in my country. Some people say that the reason why the number of apartments is drastically increasing in our society is that because our country is very small and the population is exponentially expanding, the apartment is an appropriate housing form to ours. <TR>However</TR>, I believe that there are more specific reasons that although a lot of money is needed to buy a house in an apartment, people strongly want to live in there and try to make sufficient money very hard to purchase their own house, and I want to delve into some of the most significant ones here.</IN>

 <BO1><MI1>One of the most essential elements for this issue it that living in the apartment provides a plethora of convenience and comfort for people.</MI1> <SI1>In terms of the convenience, many facilities are concentrated in or near the apartment such as grocery store, fitness center, kindergarten, and even department store. So, residents do not need to go far away to buy something, exercise, or raise children. <TR>Moreover</TR>, because there is enormously broaden parking lot, people do not worry about finding the space to park their cars. In view of the comfort, the apartment has a good heating and cooling system, which is very important in my country because summer is too hot and winter is very cold. People can regulate proper temperature of the house by clicking several buttons or even operating an auto temperature regulating system. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, as the traditional house uses the classical heating method to control room temperature using fire and usually has the structure to be hard to use the cooling system using air conditioner. According to a recent study released by the Korean National Research Center, more than four-fifths of the surveyed people who moved from traditional house to apartment mentioned that the main reason to transfer to new house is that it is more convenient and comfortable to live in apartment. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is evident that apartment provides better circumstances for people.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2>Another reason that must be considered is that there are more opportunities to get along with others.</MI2> <SI2>Apartment complex is so large that a numerous number of people live there, and there are various organizations, clubs and even just gatherings. <TR>Thus</TR>, people can have many chances to contact with other people for the various purposes. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I moved to new apartment, I liked the tennis but did not have any friends to play the tennis in the apartment. <TR>However</TR>, after I found the tennis club in the apartment at the bulletin board and joined it, I could play the tennis with residents.</EX> <TR>To conclude</TR>, living in the apartment is good to meet new people.</SI2></BO2>

"The purpose of television should be for education, not for entertainment.",::,"<IN><TR>In these days</TR>, television dominates most of our lives. <TR>As it is</TR>, People usually obtain lots of information and find enjoyment from TV. <TR>In this respect</TR>, some argues that the purpose of television should be for education, not for entertainment.<TS> <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with the argument for the following reasons. <TR>First</TR>, television must allow people to relieve their stress. <TR>Additionally</TR>, the number of people who watch TV can be an evidence of entertainment as the television’s goal.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, people should find relief by watching television.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Nowadays</TR> people are under great pressure caused by overwhelming works either studying or working. <TR>In this sense</TR>, they seem to relieve their high-levels of stress by watching television. This is because most of television programs consist of movies, live performances, sports, and comedy shows which provide people with great enjoyment. By just watching TV, people can forget about their problems and enjoy the moment. <EX>Let me use my brother as an example. He had to deal with large amounts of tasks at work and interact with many people including his subordinates and bosses. When he comes home, he always tried to watch comedy shows in order to refresh his body and mind. For a short time, he seemed to forget about his worries related to problems at work and obtain enough breathing space. It was obvious that the comedy shows gave him great relief from his stressful life. This case illustrates that TV should be a stress-reliever by playing an important role in entertainment.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI1><TR>Furthermore,</TR> people’s needs on television programs can be a strong reason for its entertainment factor as purposes.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words</TR>, many producers who are working in broadcasting center know the fact that people usually like to watch programs which are made up of entertainment contents. This phenomenon has been investigated by some researchers. <TR>To be specific</TR>, the number of people who love to watch entertainment programs was three times more than those who seek to watch educational programs. Also, according to the recent study conducted by Korean National Research Center, two thirds of respondents stated that television should provide people with programs associated with entertainment. They added that if they wish to achieve the purpose of education, they would use courses that are given by academic institutions. This results show that the purpose of television should be limited to the entertainment.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, although television gives various information or contents through lots of programs, its ultimate goal should be for entertainment. This is because TV should have a function as a stress-reliever for people.

visiting museum is the best way to learn about the country.,::,"<IN>Opinions migh be divided over whether visiting museums is the best way to learn about a country.
Peple have different types of life have different stances on this issue.
<TS>Pesonally i do not agree with the statement that visiting museums is the good way to learn about the country.</TS>There are two reasons that could validate my position.</IN>
 
 
<BO1><MI1> First i think the best way to learn about the country is talking with residents and be friend with them.</MI1> <SI1>Just visiting museums could not be proper way to learn the country in detail. 
Residents can tell about the history of the country and the characteristics could reflect the country's style.
Also we can know about people's perspectives .
Let me take my experience as an example.
<EX>I went to the China to study about chineese last 3 years ago. I did not have any information about China . I was worried and reserved how to deal with China people. However i met a girl in my class and she explain about the China culture, people's perspectives, foods and so on. Without making friends i could not know about China such in detail.  She explains about how to behave in there and i enjoyed the holiday in China with her . Without her help i can not want to stay in there and do not know about the china's culture.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
 
 <BO2><MI2>Another way to learn about the country enjoy their holidays and culture and foods.</MI2> <SI2>I think experience is the best way to know about the other coutry. Just visiting museum it can be a boring way to know about the country.
All the countries have traditional cultures and foods. It can help you to understand the country.
Let me take my experience as an example.
<EX>I went to japan last vacation i was impressed and amazed by their culture and foods. I did not know anything about the japan and i did not expected exactly before arriving in japan.
However my mind began to change when i experience their culture and foods. They have tea culture it is very famous in Japan.
When they drink tea they do not talk to each other. I was amazed because in our country people have conversation when they drink tea. It was odd in my country but it was good way to learn about Japan.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
 
<CO>All in all these two reasons i mentioned above are the way i think.
Experience about the country's foods , culture , holidays and making friends in there will be a good way to know exactly.</CO>",::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,3,::,3,::,"Your essay is pretty good, but your structure needs work.

 It is sometimes said that borrowing money from a friend can harm or damage the friendship. Do you agree? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.,::,"<IN><TS>It has become quite a common proverb in my country that ""be careful about borrowing or lending some money or even little from your partner, especially between the best friends or family members.""  Another way to say, this is that the monetary affairs is related to relationship with our companion. In other words, we can have conflict with our friend or break up with our buddy, because of money, although we just think of that as external material, not morality and refinement. <TR>For that reason</TR>, some people believe that the human relations are more important than any other substance like money. Other people believe that borrowing money from friend can harm or damage the friendship.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>The first group of people say that they had better lend money to their friend if he or she want to borrow in the situation of danger without any requirement, and they have indistinct assurance about the return of money.</MI1> <SI2>They point out that the friendship is the best virtue in their life. <TR>Similarly</TR>, they say that money is nothing but by-product, and they want to place more weight on amity with their friend. To grant a specific reason, the document of confucianism in such Asia as China, korea has the contents about friendships. Scholar in such a field focused on not material or surface like money but mind or body like friendship. These people are willing to lend money if their friends hit hard times and need some money for getting out of troubles on the spur of the moment.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In the other hand</TR>, there are people who think that the pecuniary problems can't ameliorate the bearing of relationship because they can make their friend troublesome by borrowing money from their buddy.</MI2> <SI2>Suppose that their friend give them some money. After a little times, their friend bump into some difficuties. At that time, if they don't have capacity to compensate the money at the time of return, their friend can't say that they should deprive the money from their poor friend. Their friend who lend the best friend some money may be in bad shape and have lots of troubles. <TR>Therefore</TR>, these people are reluctant to borrow or lend something involved with money from even credible friend.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>Personally</TR>, I find that I cannot align myself completely with either group. That's why I have some reservation about both positions. No one can deny that we must lend some money to our friend when he or she have any troubles in financial problems. But I think that ""exorbitant"" request, which deal with amounts of money, can make our friend feel heavy liability like a ponderous burden. In my opinion, we can say to our friend about tender rebuff in terms of financial affairs, if it may generate our anguish in the future. We can only exchange some money with our friends as long as we can take responsibility for the money.</CO>",::,5,::,0,::,3,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"Your essay is good, but you haven't really answered the question.

People recognize a difference between children and adults. What events (experiences or ceremonies) make a person an adult? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.,::,"<IN>Most people realize that they are adults when they reach some ages but the ages are all different. Sometimes, people recognize a difference between children and adults through special events such as entering university, being independent from their parents or getting marriage. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I believe that earning money for living can make people to be adults. This is because people can have responsibilities and realistic thoughts through the independence of economy.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, earning for living lead people to have responsibilities that adults should have.</MI1> <SI2>Though there are many experiences that can make people to obtain responsibility, it is hard to acquire real responsibility before they do not need to make money. <EX>When my parents were retired and I had to begin making money, I realized that I could be no longer child because I should work with duty. If I could not earn money by myself, I could not do anything. I could not ask my economic problem to parents and friends. The time when I should make decisions and think the results was begun when I started to earn.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, people begin to have realistic thoughts when they have to earn for living.</MI2> <SI2>I believe that realistic thinking is the representative character of most adults. Sometimes, adults have to do work which they might imagine to do when they were young. They have to cheer people whom they dislike for earning. They should refute temptations of thing which they want to have because their earning may be limited. In contrast to adults, children believe unlimited possibility and have creativity because they cannot know directly the difficulties of money shortage.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO>In my view, experiences of making money for basic living make a person an adult. People can acquire the responsibility as an adult through earning. They start to think their life realistically when they earn for living. Proper responsibility and realistic ideas are probably significant character of adults. Earning money may mean the earning properties of adults.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,An excellent essay! Good work!,//

<BO1><MI1><TR>In the first place</TR>, I think that the more important a problem is the more careful we have to be on making up our mind, since life is composed of all kinds of decision making.</MI1> <SI1>We must spend enough time to analyze the problem and think about the results of each options before making an important decision. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, in 1998 when Korea was under IMF crisis, my uncle who owns a company had to make a decision between laying off half of his employees and continue the business without any restructuring.

As my uncle and his employees have overcome the crisis together, they became closer, trust between them became very high and the teamwork has increased.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, most of decisions made in a short time, especially under a lot of pressure, are irrational and impulsive, so it’s easy for us to regret about the quick decision we made and to be dissatisfied with its results.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was in high school I cheated in my math exam to get a better grade.

"When people need to complain about a product or poor service, some prefer to complain in writing and others prefer to complain in person. Which way do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
",::,"<IN>We are often disappointed because of bad products or poor service. Many people may tolerate the situations but sometimes we want to complain about products or service to company. In such situations, there are various ways to convey our thought. The two representative options may be complaining in person or writing. <TR>However</TR>, <TS>I prefer complaining in person to writing because the way is more effective to obtain direct response of the company.</TS></IN>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, it is hard for company to realize the degree of consumers’ anger by reading the opinion.</MI2> <SI2>Though writing can lead people to be logical, company seems to believe that the complaint is not urgent because the person who is disappointed on their products has composure. Sometimes they think the complaint is only opinion and it is unnecessary to change their products or service. I believe that complain might need somewhat rude and harsh voice and, thus, can make company alter their products.</SI2></BO2>

What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.,::,"<IN>When I had attended a university in 1995, I came to have an opportunity to present a paper in a class, which I had never done before due to the specific educational environment in my country. I gave my paper which was written with pen to the professor, but he didn't accept my paper at that time under the reason of unacceptable format of the paper. What he preferred was paper typed in computer. Even though his unfaired preference was out of the point, it was a sort of cultural shock even in a country for the people who have never recognized the importance of computer skill like me. <TR>That experience became a beginning point to reconsider a computer skill as one of the most important skill to carry on my life far away from failure, even if it is hard to define what the successful life is.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>As of turning the year 1995</TR>, the world is drastically going to the age of globalization by the generalization of Internet.</MI1><SI1> Even though I cannot underestimate the contribution of TV and telephone when I mention globalization, it is obviously the Internet to make the world getting smaller. We can communicate people abroad the world through Internet, and we also can obtain useful information from somebody's webpage. It is reasonable that various computer skills such as typing, making picture or editing documents are needed to get communicated each other through Internet. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Creating their own webpage is one of the most useful and important things among computer skills.</MI2> <SI2>Sometimes people can do in cyber space while they didn't do in physical space due to some kind of restrictions. Web-hosting business or electric marketing could be representative examples. If people want to run a small business in physical space, they probably have to consider a lot of expensive stuffs including real-estate so that they can afford them. In the case of business in cyber space, however, one of the most prominent cognitive objections is about their computer skills. Financial status might be second thing. If they know much about computer skills for their business in cyber space, that means they can save their financial burden much more.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Moreover,</TR> computer skills are also needed for people's successful education.</MI3> <SI3>Most contemporary educational institutions including colleges and universities suggest classes which can be accessed through Internet. Students can meet their professors on the screen in computer, presenting their mid-term papers using email. For professors, they can upload their professionized papers or academic results on their personal webpage so that students can get access easily to obtain more useful information for their academic activities.</SI3></BO3>

<CO>Due to those reasons I have discussed, I would like to insist that learning computer skills based on communication through Internet is the most important skill for people's successful lives. Somebody argues that people need language skill first before learning computer skills because they think most computer skills including using Internet are based on English. Even though I think I can't ignore the importance of learning language, especially English, I would like to point out that most computers can support various languages for the users’ environment so that they don't have any problem to learn computer skills even if they don't know English. <TR>Moreover</TR>, learning computer skills can also support the opportunity for learning different language more easily while learning language is not eager to do that, in converse.</CO>",::,5,::,2,::,4,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,"Your English skills are impressive, but your points are not very clear.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, I think easier food preparation did not improve the way people to live because it deprived people of communications with their family.</MI1> <SI1>Usually, people talk at table each other, which is especially important to family members because they don't have much time to get together due to their work. <TR>However</TR>, people can eat whenever they want in these days, so they do not need to get together to have a meal and this can cause barriers between family members. <TR>Thus</TR>, easier food preparation did not improve the way people to live in the aspects of communications within family members.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>.

",::,"<IN><TS>Nowadays high schools teach a lot of subjects to their students.
