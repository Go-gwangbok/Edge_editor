1&Scientist should take responsibility for their inventions when they have the potential to be dangerous to humans.,::,"<IN>Some people believe that scientist should not take responsibility for their inventions when they have the potential to be dangerous to humans because this people think that inventions which are developed by scientists are so useful for living of human. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I think that they should have responsibility for their inventions when they have dangerous factors.</TS> There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that they have known negative effect of their inventions. And the other reason is that taking responsibility can give scientists opportunity to develop their studies.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> scientists know that they are creating something that has the potential to cause serious destruction. <TR>As a result,</TR> they should share the moral responsibility.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when the atom bomb was developed, Robert Opphenheimer knew that the atom bomb can cause to kill many people and to make cities devastated. But he made the atom bomb and it contributed to break out the second world war.</EX> <SI1><TR>Finally,</TR> creating the atom bomb exchanged the lives of people.</SI1> This example shows that scientist should take the responsibility for their inventions.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> if scientist has responsibility, they can have a chance to develop their research.</MI2> <SI2>Taking responsibility can make that scientists are concerned about public opinion through the internet or news. So they can earn feedback quickly on their creations and it can be foundation to advance the inventions of high quality. <TR>As a result,</TR> taking responsibility for scientist invention bring about improvement of society.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> scientists already know that how their creation dangerous and scientist also have an opportunity to develop their creations. So these are the reasons why I think that scientist should have responsibility for their creations when creations has dangerous factors.</CO>

Your thesis statement is good and so is your first reason, but the second reason is weak and requires more explanation.  Also, check your facts - Oppenheimer built the atom bomb in the middle of the second world war, and he did not fully realize the danger of it.  That is one weak point in your argument - sometimes scientists DON'T know that their inventions will be used negatively.  Overall, you have organized this essay very well, and your transitions are great.  Excellent structure, and good use of vocabulary.",//
2&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,::,"<IN>As more and more people are seeking after a job where it offers a fine salary, people begin to realize that having a good supervisor is another important fact when considering for a job. In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>For starters,</TR> good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees promote faster and that is what they do in their position at work.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In addition,</TR> this not only make the employees enhance their positions but paves the way to make company a better reputation by having good leaders.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my older sister, who finished graduate school, got a job where it gives enough salary. <TR>Afterwards,</TR> my sister had a supervisor who had a very strong leadership. Since the boss led my sister very well with good judgement and nice advices, she promoted much faster than her friends from graduate school.</EX> This implies that strong leadership is a very important characteristic of a good supervisor.<BO1>

<BO2><TR>Secondly,</TR> friendly leader is probably what the all employees are wishful to have at their work place. <SI2>This is because most of the workers from all over the world suffer from stresses at work because of high pressure from boss or because of unfriendly environment.<SI2><MI2><TR>However,</TR> if a leader is very friendly, that will create much comfortable atmosphere where all of the employees can work with such enjoyment and that will eventually lead to a long term work.</MI2> <EX><TR>To be more detailed,</TR> there was a survey among the workers from renowned company about the reason why they work in the long term. <TR>Not surprisingly,</TR> about half of them answered because of the high name value of the company, but other half of them responded that it is because of good leaders who are very friendly.</EX> This definitely implies the important quality of a good supervisor is a amiable personality.</BO2>

<CO><TR>On the whole,</TR> even though the jury is still out, I firmly believe that having a good leadership and friendly personality is the most significant traits among others because of faster promotion and enjoyable atmosphere at work.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,"This is an excellent essay.

3&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,::,"<IN>Many people have a tendency to watch sports game on TV. There are many people watch them, although they are televised at late night. <TR>In addition,</TR> people who do not watch them last night used to check the result of game in the morning through the Internet and newspaper, not to mentioned news. It is a good material to have a conversation with others in school and workplace. <TS><TR>In this sense,</TR> playing sports has an influence on our daily life and I think that it is helpful to improve the quality of our life owing to a character that includes some important lessons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> people can learn various skills that are useful for them to adapt to their life.</MI1> <SI1>Because of the fact that human beings are social animal, if they are isolated from their society, they would feel stressed and turn bad or violent, not communicating with others. <TR>For this reason,</TR> it is very important for them to live in their society. By playing sports, we can get a cooperation skill and social skill that are essential for us. Playing sports is not a survival game, but one of the methods of conversation that makes it possible for them to understand each other.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> the advantage of playing sports games is that we can learn sportsmanship, which is called the spirit of fair play.</MI2> Today, a huge number of games are held, with fixed rules demanded.<EX> Soccer game is a very popular game all over the world. However, it sometimes causes terrible accidents that take place in playing field.</EX> It is not right. Not only is it an illegal behavior, but also it deserves to be criticized. <SI2>The most important thing is not the result of the game, not player's attitude. Players have to respect other players, do their best and play fairly.<SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> as I just mentioned above, playing sports games provides people with valuable lessons about their life.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,5,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,"I like your approach to the essay.  I think you have a very easy, fluid writing style, and that makes it easy to read.  I like that, while you have clear main points and supporting points, they are not necessarily in order.

Think a little broader and come up with a second main point that is not so close to the first point.",//
4&You have received a gift of money. The money is enough to buy either a piece of jewelry you like or tickets to a concert you want to attend. Which would you buy?,::,"<IN>Some people may think that purchasing jewelry would better than attending a concert. The jewelry could be valuable in realistic. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly recommend visiting the concert instead of buying a piece of jewelry for two points.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>First point is that people hardly need worrying about losing memories.</MI1> A piece of jewelry would make people worry about losing it. Because of these worries, people can suffer from their mental stress. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> the memory is not going anywhere. <TR>Moreover,</TR> the impression that people could get from the concert would makes people happy. <SI1>With the help of the concert, people could refreshed and concentrate in their work much better by relieving stress form daily life.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when people get a lottery, they might be happy at first. <TR>However,</TR> there is a chance that it could be stolen or lost. So that people could not help worrying. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> if I attend exciting concert, I could recharge myself and get rid of stress. <TR>With this aspect,</TR> the memory of concert allows me pay attention to my work better.</EX></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>The other point is that people can find their new interest by attending concert.</MI2> When people attend the concert, the singer’s feather could be one of attractive things. <TR>Thus,</TR> it can promote people’s interest naturally. <SI2><TR>In contrast,</TR> a piece of jewelry hardly promotes people’s interest.</SI2> The impression that people get from it is only beautiful or pretty. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my favorite singer played the guitar at his concert one year ago. I was so impressed that I started to practice playing the guitar after the concert. Nowadays, playing a guitar becomes one of my hobbies.</EX> <TR>For this reason,</TR> attending concert could let me find my interest.</BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> I firmly recommend that people should attend the concert rather than make a purchase of a piece of jewelry. Even thought it could be a valuable, I can get stressed by worrying about losing it. <TR>In contrast,</TR> I can get helpful memory and find another interest by attending a concert.</CO>

5&The ability to read and write is more important today than in the past. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>A lot of controversy exists over whether the literacy ability is more significant nowadays than in the past. Some might disagree with the given statement because the advent and development of literacy was greatly improved in the past than today. <TS><TR>Personally, however,</TR> I firmly think that reading and writing skill becomes increasingly more  important these days for several reasons. <TR>First of all,</TR> the employment competition is boosted now. <TR>Not only that,</TR> but people usually use the Internet in their daily routines.</TS> The following statements will support the opinion.</IN>

<BO1><TR>More than anything else,</TR> people are more competitive than before because it is difficult to find the job. <MI1>In modern society, people are likely to work at the company rather than just doing agriculture living in hometown like in the past. <TR>Thus,</TR> they have to put much effort on improving their reading and writing capability to get into preferred workplace.</MI1> <TR>As a result,</TR> the ability to read and write plays more crucial role in improving people's life. <EX>According to a study recently released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two thirds of CEOs of the corporations responded that they regard reading and wrting skill importantly because it is necessary in working.<SI1>Based on the research, they insisted that second-language is also important in global world.</SI1></EX> <TR>As this example demonstrates,</TR> it is no doubt that the literacy competitiveness is much more important than before.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Besides,</TR> the technological development leads people to boost reading and writing skill.</MI2> <TR>Obviously,</TR> it is true that some people still enjoy off-line lives. <TR>However,</TR> current trend is using internet at shopping, doing assignments and communicating with others. <SI2><TR>Therefore,</TR> it is no coincidence that the literacy capability is required to modern people to use the Internet which is based on reading and writing.</SI2> <EX><TR>To illustrate,</TR> one of my friends Jessica is works on the net, not commuting to and from the work. <TR>Also,</TR> she shop around the Internet shopping malls with easy access to computer. <TR>Furthermore,</TR> she communicate with her parents who lived far away by e-mail.</EX> Without the literacy talent, she would not be able to live conveniently and effectively. <TR>In this sense,</TR> people these days should have the talents on reading and writing due to the development of technology.</BO2>

<CO><TR>As I have argued,</TR> I strongly believe that the capability of reading and writing is more importnat than before. This is due to the fact that competitive society and technological development. <TR>Given this,</TR> it is quite obvious that modern people need the skill how to read and write than in the past.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,"Overall, your essay style is excellent.

"6&Today, life is easier and cozier than it was when our grandparents were young. Do you agree or disagree?",::,"<IN>Some people may argue that the generation of our grandparents was much easier and more comfortable to live. <TR>However,</TR> for the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8000 years, there have been significant changes. Adam and Eve became seven people population of people. Along with the growth in the number of population, growth in technology and income has blossomed as well. <TS><TR>Therefore,</TR> I strongly believe that life in my period of time has much better condition than the generation of grandparents’.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Modern society has created a number of inventions that people only dreamed of in the past.</MI1> <EX>People in the past had to do the laundries with their bare hands, spend time to wash their dishes, walk or ride horses to get to the destination, and sleep on the hard ground.</EX><TR> Yet,</TR> those are the conditions that the people in nowadays cannot even imagine living in. There are washing machines that do our laundries, dish washers that brighten our dishes, cars and airplanes that allow us to travel around the world within a day, and beds that provide comfortable environment for us to have sweet dreams. <SI1><TR>Nevertheless,</TR> there is an even better invention that distinguishes our lives from those of grandparents’; the Internet.</SI1> It has made our lives prosperous and easy. Thanks to the Internet, we can now shop clothes, furniture, and even groceries online. No one is required to leave their houses to purchase. <TR>Moreover,</TR> the Internet contains not only the shopping mall, but also the entertainment. It provides us with great games, movies, and dramas. <TR>Basically,</TR> everything that required labor force in the past is now possible without it due to the help of the Internet.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2>The internet and other developments have done a lot to enhance my generation’s living condition, but economic growth has done tremendous job to enrich the living environment.</MI2> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my grandfather is a war veteran who fought in Korean War. The growth domestic product per person back then was less than a dollar, <TR>whereas</TR> the current GDP per person in Korea is over 20,000 dollars.</EX> <SI2>With this great advancement in economic growth, people can now afford products such as cars, cozy houses, and clothes.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>I feel grateful for my grandparents and the ancestors beyond them for letting me enjoy the abundance of this generation. Even though nothing lets me to live an immortal live, it is evident that remarkable development in technology and extensive growth in income permit my generation to live in better quality of lives than that of grandparents’. <TR>Therefore,</TR> I am strongly against the statement that our grandparents had better quality of live than our generation.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"This is an excellent essay.  You make your points clearly and use excellent examples.  Your writing is very fluid and easy to follow.  Great work!  My only critique is that your last sentence contradicts the writing prompt.

"7&Which do you prefer working alone or working with a team?

",::,"<IN>Co-working and collaboration are hot issues today. The society is more complex than before which means that there is no definitive answer for problem solving in these days. <TR>Thus,</TR> we need to listen carefully and to understand deeply the other's voices. It looks like that takes more time and more effort compared to single persons’ problem strategies. <TR>However,</TR> this is right approach, if we consider future risks.</IN>

<BO1>Collective Intelligence contains diverse aspects. <TR>As mentioned previous paragraph,</TR> there are lots of stakeholders even in single and small events today. <TR>Thus,</TR> these different voices might be future risks. <TR>So far,</TR> in the process of the problem solving and gathering ideas, we need a time for listening from various opinions from various stakeholders. <EX>Let's assume the road construction project, if local government do this project by top-down approach, this would make severe problems between local residents and users; If local government does not consider 'noisy', 'natural resources', and 'congestion', local people might make some protest for that. <TR>So far,</TR> construction period will be delayed or even possibly canceled.</TR> <MI1><TR>Thus,</TR> working together and listening the diverse voices are short-cuts to make effective accomplishment.</MI1></BO1>

<BO2><TR>Secondly,</TR> one plus one is more than two. This sentence looks too common. <TR>However,</TR> it contains lots of meaning. Let's assume the participatory discussion and debate in company; brain storming and mind-mapping are good examples. Through these kinds of events, the participants easily get the other's ideas and develop their idea by assistance from the others. <TR>In other words,</TR> we can find positive-leverage effects by working together. Definition of knowledge, which has been changed, is more worthy in case of spreading out to the others.</BO2>

<CO><TR>Sum up,</TR> everyone knows that to think alone and do alone is faster than working together. I firmly believe that it is not right approach. I repeatedly said that we need to consider more diverse aspects and various voices. Today, leader is not only one person. Meaning of leader is changed as like facilitator. <TR>Therefore,</TR> team members work together and think together to find a right solution; this is more proper approach in complex society.</CO>

"8&The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.

",::,"<IN>Some people say that it is important to cooperate with others well today than in the past. <TS><TR>However,</TR> on the other hand, I think that it is more important in the past than now to cooperate with people for the following reasons : people were not able to make up their living if they do not cooperate and because they have neighbours very close to them, it was important to cooperate.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> it was important to cooperate with others to help out each other when they need some help.</MI1> This is due to the fact that people had to make all things by themselves at that time and those works required a lot of labor sometimes like when you are building a house or planting rice. It was not easy for them to do those things by themselves as it took lots of time and effort. <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> there was a research done by Seoul National University showing comparison between the past and now how things got simpler and easier by the technology development. They found out that almost all works could be done with all sorts of machines.</EX> There was hardly a thing that could not be done. <SI1>People now do not have to depend on somebody else to help them with any kinds of work and therefore the importance of cooperating with others is weaken.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> it was important to cooperate and keep a good relationship with neighbours in the past.</MI2> This is attributed to the fact that people usually lived in a village, their houses side by side. Because they see each other very often and people at that time did not move their homes easily, it was common for people to live with their neighbours next to them for entire life. <TR>To be specific,</TR> if they had not keep a good relationship, they would have lived a stressful life because they see one another as many times as they see their family members. <SI2>Unlike in the past, now many people live in an apartment building, only have a few neighbours in each floor and they hardly see each other as they are busy with their own lives.</SI2> <EX>There was a survey done by some apartments asking how many times they see their neighbours and how close they are with them. The result was that there were people even did not know who lived next door and they were not usually close with them, just showing basic curtesy by simple greetings.</EX> This implies that because people in the past lived their lives with their neighbours close, it would have been important to cooperate with them in order to live happy lives.</BO2>

<CO><TR>In brief,</TR> although the ability to cooperate is important now, there were more needs of this ability in the past to make up their living easy and to live happy lives with the neighbours living next door.</CO>

9&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN><TS>Games have positive effect not only on children but also on adults.</TS> Sometimes violent computer games make people aggressive and commit some illegal affairs. <TR>However,</TR> games are not a petty or frivolous thing even to adults.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> adults can get along with others and relieve stress as children do so.</MI1> When using the word, ‘game,’ we use ‘play’ as a verb. ‘Playing’ is the human natural behavior and all of us naturally learn how to play by ourselves. <SI1>By playing games, people form social relationship with friends, teachers, and their families.</SI1> It is not merely example for children. <TR>Especially,</TR> when adults get stressed out from their working places or relationships with others, they can relieve stress by playing games such as basketball or baseball games. <EX><TR>In my case,</TR> I usually play computer games with my friends when I get stressed out from study.</EX> It makes me forget some bad things temporarily and gives a chance to get along with my friends.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> adults can feel a sense of achievement when they win the game.</MI2> Most games have the competitive characteristic. Games have certain rules, and players should follow and obey these rules in order to win the game. From the start of a game, people begin the game with the same condition. <TR>However,</TR> when proceeding the game, they meet difficulties and they may have competitive spirit to defeat someone else. Under fair rules, people lies on the competition in good faith. <SI2>This good competitive spirit has a positive effect on their life and outside of the game as well.</SI2> In the end of the game, we can feel joyful emotions and it stimulates our motivation more synergetic when we win others or get a higher score in a game.</BO2>

10&It is not desirable for teachers to express their view on social or political issues views in class. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>Nowadays role of teachers has tremendous importance in our lives. Opinions are divided over this statement that showing view political and social issues in class is not good for teacher. I do not agree with this statement for two reasons. <TS><TR>First,</TR> teacher can help student to understand well about social or political issues by showing their opinions with many media sources’ view. <TR>Secondly,</TR> student can be competitive.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>More than anything else,</TR> I think teacher only can help student to understand social and political issues. </MI1> <SI1>Teachers’ main role is to convey knowledge to students, so they are able to mention well-balanced view by integrating their own thinking and other authors’ view about social and political.</SI1> <TR>Therefore</TR> it will be helpful for student to have opportunity to be well informed about current society’s issues. Let me suggest example that can support my claim. <EX>I had a chance to travel to Africa continent few years ago. I was highly shocked that numerous people were suffering from starvation and AIDS. Even many children were in malnourished and had little or no access to education. I could not comprehend why these innocent people had to live in such detrimental conditions. So I sought out various sources about it on the Internet to learn more about as to the issues. There were conflicting views opinions in articles. Some news blamed first world countries for not providing enough aid to impoverish countries. Other pointed the finger at the civil wars among ethnic group in African continent. Thus, I could not understand which view is right.  Some days after, history teacher expressed his opinion regarding this issue, and suggested other experts ‘ perspectives in class. <TR>As a result,</TR> I was able to better understand the situation in a balanced view.</EX> <TR>As my experience shows,</TR> teacher can help student to comprehend current issue well. </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> students are able to enhance their debating skills through discussion with teachers and classmates about main issues of society.</MI2> <SI2>Nowadays most employers of companies put importance on candidates’ real working ability such as socializing and discussion skills when they choose their workers. Thus students who have high level of debating can be competitive in job market.</SI2>I would explain how my reason could be supported. <EX>When teachers express their opinion about social and political events in the class, some student can have different view.  In that situation, teacher can divide the class into two groups, and two groups debate over the teacher’s view. For the discussion, teacher would prepare well and help progression of it. <TR>Thus,</TR> students are able to learn how to make points against others though debating experience.</EX><TR> As seen above,</TR> the discussion regarding social and political event with teachers and friends who express their perspectives will give great opportunity to improve their discussing skill to students. </BO2>

<CO><TR>As mentioned above regarding the topic,</TR> I think that it is desirable to show their perspective about social or political issues in class for the following reasons. <TR>Firstly,</TR> student can get balanced comprehension as to social or political issue through that teachers show their opinion with many authors’ views. <TR> Moreover,</TR> student can be grow up their debating ability through discussion about social issue with teacher.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"Overall this is a very good essay.

11&It is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times.,::,"<IN>Some people prefer to change jobs several times rather than to work at the same company for a long time.

12&Universities and high schools should teach students about specific careers and fields instead of general subjects.,::,"<IN>Some people say that it is better to study general subjects than specific careers. <TS><TR>However, generally speaking,</TR> I believe that universities and high schools should teach students about specific careers in place of general subjects.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> studying specific fields helps the students get jobs much easier.</MI1> Since the students studied some special careers, they are more likely to know what they want to become or where they want to work. <SI1><TR>Also,</TR> they are more professional.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> according to a study conducted by Seoul National University in Korea, ten people of Group A which majored in a certain career, was much faster at getting jobs than ten people of Group B who studied a broader and a more general career. Group B was having a hard time figuring out special fields that they were good at.</EX> This clearly shows that it is more convenient to learn a more detailed topic than a general one. </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> it boosts the interest of students in studying.</MI2> There are many students who are not interested in studying, simply because they do not find it interesting for them. Studying specifically about certain topics will help them to find their talents or interests.<EX> <TR>For example,</TR> I can recall that when I took art class, the teacher offered to teach me more about painting after school. I thought I was not very good at art, but as she taught me more detailed and harder techniques, I found out that I love arts. This made me realize that it is very important to know well what you are studying in order to fully grasp your ability.</EX> <SI2>I would be the first one to admit that learning general subjects helps students find what they are interested in. <TR>However,</TR> it does not provide an environment where students can focus on one subject.</SI2> <TR>Therefore,</TR> I think that studying more detailed subjects encourage students to know what they really enjoy learning.</BO2>

"14&Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.",::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own. <TS>I disagree that individual people can’t do anything about environmental issues for two reasons. <TR>First,</TR> the reason of global warming which is the biggest environmental problem is carbon emissions from cars. <TR>Second,</TR> individual people can have a great impact on environmental issues through the Internet.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> carbon emissions from cars have a negative effect on environment.</MI1> Some people might say that only government can solve the environmental problems since it is too complex. <TR>However,</TR> let me show an example to prove why individual people can help to solve the environmental issues. <EX>Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world. Floods and landslides took the lives of countless people as well as placing affected areas at health risk. European nations were no exception. Many areas there were flooded or suffered wildfire.<TR> Sadly,</TR> it was extremely costly to ensure that all victims were able to put their lives back together.</EX> <MI1>Carbon emissions from cars and other human activities are largely responsible for global warming.</MI1> <SI1>Various measures are being taken by governments to handle this problem. Efforts to develop better technology for solar and wind energy are gaining momentum.  Governments ask people to use subways and buses on their way to home and work rather than driving their own cars. Driving less and using public transportations can be done by people’s individual efforts.</SI1> This shows that individual people can help to solve environmental problems by driving less and using public transportation. </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> environmental issues can be affected by individual people thanks to Internet.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my house is located near the industrial area.

"15&In order to stay well-informed, people should get information from various news sources.",::,"<IN>It is evident that in our current society, getting news from a variety of media has tremendous importance in our lives and it is common thing.  Opinions are divided over the taking information from various sources is needed to people in order to be well informed. I do not agree with this statement for two reasons.  <TR>Firstly,</TR> different view of many sources is confusing. <TR>Moreover,</TR> I think getting information from various news sources keep people from deep understanding.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>More than anything else,</TR> people would be confused when they get information from a lot of news sources, because each media has different opinion about one fact. <TR>Thus</TR> people cannot be in well informed.</MI1> <EX>This reminds me of the time when I traveled to some countries of Africa in college years. While there, I was highly shocked by the large number of people who were suffering from starvation and AIDS.  Naturally I become to have interest about problem of poverty in Africa countries. So, when I came back to the Korea, I searched information about those countries that I visited from many websites. I read lots of articles,<TR> however,</TR> each of them has different contents. Some sources said that countries’ government in Africa does not spend their money improving quality of people’s lives. <TR>In contrast,</TR> other news said that their government cannot afford to support their nation, and serious poverty is caused by not enough aid from advanced countries. <TR>Therefore,</TR> after I saw these sources, I could not know the real truth and confused due to the totally different information.</EX><TR> As my experience shows,</TR> the information from various materials makes people to be confused.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> I think it is impossible to have deep understanding without enough time for one source.</MI2> Let me explain my case that can support my claim. <EX>When I was in high school, I had to submit report about global warming in the class. I was eagerly in that class, so thought that getting lots of information is best way to know the issue. <TR>Thus,</TR> I tried to find information as many as possible both in library and in video posted in the Internet. <TR>However,</TR> it was impossible for me to fully understand all detail of my all collected sources because of enormous quantity of information. <TR>Thus,</TR> teacher of that class gave me a comment that I have a just superficial knowledge, and suggested me to read just one thesis many times than to glance many articles to stay in well informed.</EX> <TR>In this sense,</TR> we can definitely notice that if we obtain information from many new sources, we cannot totally understand all of it. </BO2>

<CO><TR>As mentioned above regarding the issue,</TR> I think people are not able to stay well informed when they get information from many news media for following reasons. First reason is that people are confused by different information from variety of news sources.

Because environmental issues are very complex, individuals can do nothing about them on their own.",::,"<IN>Some people might say that because environmental issues are very complex, individuals can do nothing about them on their own. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I think there are lots of things people can do to work out the environmental issues even though those are complex.</TS> People can take part in activities like taking public transport instead of their own car and recycling.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> people can help improve the environment to get better by starting to take small actions like using public transport rather than one's own cars.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that taking public transport helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide produced which is harmful to the environment.</SI1> <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> there was a research done by Seoul National University, that they measured the amount of carbon dioxide produced by adding the numbers of cars and see the difference. They found out that there was a quite a big gap between a car producing and when another was added in the area. This shows that when a single individual tries to take public transport instead of his own car, it will greatly affect the environment.<EX></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> recycling helps to cut down the amount of natural materials used to make products.

17&People learn more by watching television than by reading books.,::,"<IN>People might argue that people learn more by reading book than watching television. <TS><TR>On the other hand,</TR> I believe that people learn more by watching television for the following reasons : visual aids help people understand better and television provides all kinds of information all around the world.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> people can understand better by looking at the visual aids provided by television.</MI1> There will be no misunderstanding of picturing things unlike the books. <SI1>Because books are written in words, describing things, there can be misunderstanding if one understand the description wrongly and think of the thing the other way.</SI1> <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> my little brother was studying about wild life animals.

There could be no misunderstanding of him to match the name and the look of the animals.</EX> This implies that watching television helps people to learn more, accurately.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> people can learn wide variety of things by watching television.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that almost everything, even the sound can be captured by cameras and shown on televisions.</SI2> We can learn lots of information from all over the world by just watching televisions. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> if I am curious about the place opposite of the globe from where I am living, I can just find a  television program related to the topic then I can see as well as hear how people live and speak.</EX> This implies that as books cannot be provided with sounds and visuals that move, television would be a great help for people to learn more including all points mentioned above.</BO2>

19&Exams encourage students to learn.,::,"<IN>There is a controversy over whether examinations are necessarily needed for stduents to study. Some people argue that exams are not encouraging since they make students feel stressed out and thus hinder students from learning harder. <TS><TR>In contrast,</TR> I strongly believe that exams encourage students to learn since it is a stimulus for studying hard and it is an objective evaluation to know one's level.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> exams have a positive effect on students' learning by giving them a positive stimulus.</MI1> This is because students would like to get a good grade on the test and receive recognition from their teacher, parents and friends. Most students, even students who usually do not study cram the exams before the midterms and finals. <EX>A recent study best illustrates this point. Researchers divide students into two groups. After giving each groups a English vocabulary list and making them memorize it for twenty minutes, they conduct the quiz. The average grade of the one group who was been told in advance that there would be a test was much higher than the grade of the other group who was not warned before the test. It turned out that the students in the first group concentrated on studying vocabularies while the other students felt idle not worried about the test.</EX> <SI1><TR>That is,</TR> the existence of the exams affect students' attitude toward learning.</SI1></BO1>

</BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> Exam is a good opportunity that students can exactly know about their level in their learning.</MI2> <SI2>This is because exams let students acknowledge which part they are good at and which part they need to improve more. Thanks to such feedback, students would study the weak point harder for a better understanding.</SI2> <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> when I took an English speaking course in college, my professor had a test that students should interview in English with him. <TR>At first,</TR> the thought of speaking English in front of him gave me too much pressure. <TR>However,</TR> after the test he could accurately point out my mistakes such as tail-tones that I did not notice. If I had not been for the speaking test, I would have not known my mistaken pronounciation. <TR>As a result,</TR> I am practicing to get rid of the tail tones and it is improving.</EX></BO2>

21&Students learn more important things in life inside the classroom than outside the classroom.,::,"<IN>In today’s globalized society, it is widely believed that students learn more in their classroom rather than outside the classroom.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> learning outside the classrooms is more important because it helps students relieve their stress and restore the health.</MI1> <TR>To be more specific,</TR> when students leave their classroom, they can feel free and enjoy their leisure time which as a result allows them to manage their stress, maintain health and build a quality life. <SI1> <TR>Actually,</TR> stress is a major cause of several diseases, short life span and dissatisfying life in general. As such, people on modern society should actively find the ways to reduce their stress and stay healthy. Students can do this when they are released from the school.<SI1> <EX>When I was young, school time was really stressful because I had to stay ahead and absorb information without rest. When I came back home, I went to bed immediately due to severe fatigue. My parents wanted to help me, so they planned to go to trip with me. After the trip I felt happy and I could forget about stressful aspect of my life. My health state was also enhanced. Through this experience, I realized that we cannot live quality life without outclass activities. <TR>Therefore,</TR> parents and teachers should offer some entertainment for students to enjoy outside of classroom.</EX></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> students can broaden their perspective by extracurricular activities outside the school.</MI2>  <TR>In other words,</TR> classrooms in school are some kind of closed society. Students’ views are limited because they always meet same people. Playing or doing something outside help students become more open-minded which as result allows them to better understand other cultures, different life styles and perspectives. <SI2>As modern society is becoming increasingly globalized, today’s world requires people with a strong understand of international view. Students are able to grow people whom the world wants by experiences from out of classes.</SI2> <EX><TR>To illustrate,</TR> Steven Jobs who is the founder of Apple Company made great accomplishments in his life time. I read online that he was really successful because he was global-minded and culturally sensitive.  He did this by going outside, meeting different people, traveling other country. <TR>In other words,</TR> he enjoyed his leisure time outside the school or company.</EX> <TR>Thus,</TR> it is legitimated to say that students should have their own time that can be used outside the campus.<BO2>

22&Children should wait until they start school to learn a foreign language.,::,"<IN>It is commonly believed that children should master their own mother languages and wait until they start school to learn a foreign language. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I disagree with the statement because children learn better and quicker at early childhood, children are exposed to other languages before they enter schools, and there are growing numbers of immigrant and multicultural families.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> children learn foreign languages better and quicker when they are at early childhood.</MI1> <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my cousin moved to New Jersey with his 5years old daughter two years ago. I remember my cousin worrying about his daughter when she first entered the kindergarten. He worried about his daughter because of the language barrier and if she'd get bullied by her classmates. <TR>However,</TR> I went to visit my cousin last month and I was surprised to see how my niece spoke English so fluently with almost perfect pronunciation. My cousin also told me that sometimes his daughter corrects him with pronunciations and he is very proud of his daughter being even more fluent English speaker than himself.</EX></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> it is inevitable for young people to learn other languages before entering schools.</MI2> <TR>That is,</TR> there are English words everywhere in Korea. <EX>Whenever I turn on the TV, internet or even walk around the streets, I see alphabets.</EX> <SI1>Children are exposed to English at a very young age even though they are not all English speakers.

They do not understand the entire things that surround them and are not sensible to recognize their faults before they had the same experience but was not given the right directions to correct the wrong.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my younger sister at 5 years old always made a terrible mistake when she ate meal with chopsticks. She did not know how to handle them properly at first. Whole family members tried to fix it up and now she becomes 10 years old and shows a great job with chopsticks.</EX> <TR>In this regard,</TR> children really need adults’ help regardless of difficulty and importance.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> children are surrounded by the real threats, which might have critical effects on their lives.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To be specific,</TR> many people agree that it is effective for children to learn how to solve the problems they encounter. <TR>However,</TR> it can be effective only when the problems have minor effects on children. No one can make sure that merely little accidents happen to children’s lives.</MI2> <EX>According to the recent studies by one prominent university, there are so many children taken to the emergency room in hospital for some accidents. <TR>However,</TR> the problem is that if given enough protections from adults next to them, rates of those sort of accidents will be dramatically reduced.</EX> <TR>Therefore,</TR> adults responsible for looking after children do not need to take a risks to let them experience some difficulties to encourage them to handle them on their own.<BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> not only are children too immature that they are lack of capabilities to recognize and handle the problems but also they are surrounded by danger environment, which may be hurt them irreparably. <TR>In conclusion,</TR> I firmly believe that adults, not to mention parents, should try to see very closely what children around themselves experience and make them avoid hazards.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"Your thesis statement is very unclear.

"24&Children should wait until they start school to learn a foreign language.

26&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to watch serious movies that are designed to make you think than to watch movies that are primarily designed to amuse or entertain.,::,"<IN>For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 6000 years, sources of entertainment has always existed. <TR>Nowadays,</TR> watching movies is the most popular way of spending free time. There are largely two genres of movies: comedy movies, and serious movies. Some may argue that the movies primarily designed to amuse or entertain people are better. <TS><TR>Nevertheless,</TR> serious movies are more preferable to most of the people for two reasons: they make people ponder about social issues, and contain the director’s life experiences and wisdom that are worth spreading.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> serious movies help people to think about the social issues, which they rarely discuss about.</MI1> <SI1>There certain problems of the society which are uncomfortable to talk about with friends or co-workers, such as capital punishment, selfish human nature, or sexual crimes.</SI1> Yet, serious movies often deal with the social issues that are touchy. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> Batman series: Batman begins, Dark knight, and Dark knight returns, directed by Christopher Nolan, is about the hero who saves the city, but only receive blames from the citizens and considered as convict. The movie can be seen as one of the silly super hero movies that only children would love. <TR>Yet,</TR> surprisingly, the series of movies deal with the drawbacks of the society so well that even made my brother to think about why does people have to be so selfish.</EX> If it were not for the batman series, he would be still ignorant with the problems of our society.<BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> the director’s life experiences and knowledge that are worth spreading are comprised in serious movies.</MI2> <SI2>Living in the world with the overflowing information requires, indirect experiences, in order to learn everything. <TR>Therefore,</TR> people often read to gain knowledge that is summarized or organized by other people.</SI2> <SI3><TR>Recently,</TR> movies are replacing the role of books, because it delivers information and someone else’s experiences with more details, which makes easier and efficient for the viewer to comprehend and learn.</SI3> <SI4><TR>Sadly,</TR> not all the genres of movies can do the jobs. Especially, humorous movies cannot covey any thoughts or experiences, because their primary job is to amuse and arouse laughter from people.</SI4> <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> there is a comedy movie named glory of the family. It is a Korean movie that depicts the life to a Korean gangster family that always gets into the trouble. There is no distinct storyline, and only exaggerated gestures and silly dialogues. Everyone who watched the movie says that it was funny, but says that they did not learn anything from the movie. On the other hand, since serious movies are designed to deliver messages, they contain the subjects that spur people to think deeply.</EX><BO2>

<CO>Comedy movies are amusing and fun and entertaining. They help people to release their stress and to get away from the reality for a moment. <TR>Nonetheless,</TR> unlike from watching serious movies, no productive results can be expected from watching comedy movies. <TR>As a result,<TR> watching the movies that are deep and message containing is definitely better than watching the movies that are only interesting and humorous.</CO>

27&Human activities have enhanced and improved the Earth.,::,"<IN>As the technology is advancing, there is a lot of controversy over whether the Earth have been improved and enriched by human activities. <TS>I firmly believe that people have brought exorbitant damage to the Earth by destroying the environment and decreasing the diversity of nature.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> human activities have a negative impact on the earth more than a positive effect since human activities exploited the natural resources.</MI1> <TR>That is,</TR> in order for people to live conveniently and affluently, they have thoughtlessly built the basic infrastructures, buildings and factories at the expense of the environment. <SI1><TR>Also,</TR> although cars made people's life more convenient, the air pollution was worsen because of the gases emitted by cars.</SI1> <EX>Industrial Revolution plainly demonstrates this point well. During this period, people was occupied with replacing lands and forests with numerous factories. They cleared away the woodlands and forests to build as many factories as they could. <TR>After all,</TR> the deforestation made the land susceptible to flooding and erosion. <TR>Hence,</TR> people literally devastated the environment.</EX></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> people's actions reduced the variety of foliages and faunas.</MI2> This is because people put their own interests as the first priority than any other living creatures. People does not hesitate to abuse or even worse slaughter animals to meet the desire, which cause the increased endangered animals. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> as salmon is popular among people nowadays, the demand for it is greatly increasing. Despite the limited resources, fishers are obsessed with catching them to maximize profits. They try to catch salmons more than they are allowed to do by laws and do not care about whether they are being extinct or not.</EX> <SI2><TR>Therefore,</TR> the number of endangered animals and plants are greatly soaring.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I strongly believe that people's selfish activities negatively affected the earth since people exploited the environment and decreased the diversity of wildlife. People should not behave as if they had own the earth, but rather they they should try to protect it by living together with the Earth. </CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> adding public sculptures to my hometown would make the community more beautiful.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> there was an installation artwork called The Gate, installed by Christo in the Central park, New York in the past. The Gate was an installation piece consisted of 100 orange fabrics attached to polls. People could walk through the polls like walking through the gates. The vibrant orange fabrics were flowing with the wind and made the green in the park more vivid. The park was more beautiful than in the nature itself. <TR>In addition,</TR> people didn't need to pay to see the artwork when they need to pay at least 10dollars to see artworks inside the museums.</EX> <SI1><TR>So,</TR> public artwork is an accessible resource that makes the community more beautiful.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> public artworks will attract many outside visitors.</MI2> <SI2>Even though people do not need to pay to see wondrous artworks, they will need to pay for food, and sightseeing. <TR>Then,</TR> the local markets will benefit from many visitors.</SI2> <EX><TR>As mentioned above,</TR> Christo's work attracted thousands of people from outside the city.

I don't think it is unreasonable to say this, unless he or she has a proper knowledge. <TR>However,</TR> when it comes to me, I definately need a teacher to motivate me and lead me to a right path. <TS>Since I don't have a ability to concentrate on a task, nor the deep knowledge of subjects,I obviously need somebody who can teach me.</TS> </IN>

<BO1>To begin with, as I mentioned above, I'm not a well-informed man with broad vision. If so, I would say that I can learn solitarily. <TR>But,</TR> since my knowledge of subjects are yet shallow, I need a teacher. <MI1>Most teachers got a broad vision on what they teach and thus they can give me a proper knowledge in effective way.</MI1> Since they are professionals, they can promptly and accurately give me a knowledge. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> If I am learning science without teacher, I will have hard time fixing what I should memorize or not, what I should highlight or not and so on. It will take much time to do these things. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> with teacher, who knows exactly what is what, will be able to point things that are considered important.</EX></BO1> 

<BO2><TR>On the top of that,</TR> I'm very poor on concentration. It would not be far-fetched to say that I cannot concentrate on a thing for 5 minutes.

30&Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Other think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether people learn better by themselves or with a teacher. Some people may say studying by one's self is much productive means to learn since they have their own styles of learning. <TS><TR>However, as far as I am concerned,</TR> I firmly believe that study with a teacher is more profitable way to study because it saves much time and gives proper assessment.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>For starters</TR>, studying with a teacher benefits students by saving time.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Normally</TR>, there are times when students have some difficulties with solving problems and finding solutions to that. Even with the descriptions of the problem, students occasionally do not understand why the answer is related to the problem. <TR>Thus,</TR> it leads to considerable time for students to grasp. <TR>However</TR>, if students study with a teacher, this time issue can be settled. <EX>According to my firsthand experience, I once had a difficult time when solving math problems by myself, and wasted a significant amount of time to find solutions. <TR>Nevertheless,</TR> I found a tutor who can give me a right solutions with a very detailed steps. <TR>Hence</TR>, I could understand the subject to the fullest and step onto the next material much faster which paved the way for me to gain more knowledge.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, study with a teacher is also an effective way to learn since teachers give out the appropriate assessment to students.</MI2> <SI2><TR>That is</TR>, by letting students to realize what is their weak point on the material, they can enhance their overall grades. <EX><TR>To be more specific</TR>, there were two groups in writing class with given topic. One group was evaluated with a teacher on their essay, and the other group was checking mistakes on their own. <TR>Not surprisingly,</TR> the first group with a teacher better performed with their writings when they handed their final draft. This outcome was possible by virtue of teacher's proper evaluation in which students could notice their defects of writing skill, and showed much improvement. <TR>In contrast,</TR> second group who did not get an assessment from teacher did not show any development on the writings because of their limited and objective perspectives.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>On the whole, even the jury is still out</TR>, I am consistent with my rationales.

31&Is it more important to be able to work with a group of people on a team or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>There are many kinds of people who like work with others or alone. <TR>Of course</TR>, it depends largely on the characteristics of work, with some work accomplished easily with a group of members, otherwise achieved easily alone. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I think that working alone is more efficient to accomplish a job for some reasons below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> if we work alone, we can set a schedule freely without others’ interference.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Of course,</TR> there are few jobs that we can achieve alone, but when the job is well distributed to people independently, this would eventually save time dramatically. <TR>In this case,</TR> members should know their specific role in a job. Once a person exactly knows what he should do for the job, he can schedule and plan about the steps of the job with comfortable mind rather than interfered by others such as supervisors. <EX>According to a survey, one student got a higher score when studying alone, with concentration on what he had learned, than others who study with others. This is because not only they cannot concentrate on studying, but also competitive atmosphere oppresses the students, which cause them to have uncomfortable mind.</EX> Although group members can help what someone is doing, independent job make a person finish the job efficiently in comfortable atmosphere.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, since it is difficult to know entirely about group members such as personality of a person, we can get some trouble when we work with others.</MI2> <SI2><EX>The results of group projects, for example, are often highly influenced depending on the members.</EX> <TR>Actually</TR>, there is no “I” in a group. The group members are required to work together as a team. In most cases, <TR>however</TR>, members differ from one another mostly in preference, having different opinion from others. In the case that group members do not cooperate with others and work passively, the group will disband. We often overlook the fact that somebody’s behavior would be same as when he works. <TR>However,</TR> it is not always true. We cannot entirely know about people until we face each other and work together.</SI2> To avoid such a bad situation, I think that working alone is better rather than with others.</BO2>

         <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, spending time with others is not always an affective way to reduce stress because oftentimes our stress derives from the people around us.</MI1> <SI1>Thesedays we have more chances to meet different kinds of people than past.

Sometime it is fun to meet those people, but it could be tired to fit or get along with them. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I worked as a intern two years ago, I had a boss from India.

And it was stressful to work with her and make her happy.</SI1></EX> <TR>Thus</TR> I usually had a rest by myself without interruption from others.</BO1>

        <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, spending time alone is good for us because we can decide on what we really want to do by ourselves.</MI2> <SI2>Many people might not want to be told what to do when they have fun.  We are willing to do whatever we want especilly when having a rest. <TR>Also</TR>, it gives us chance to discover new things on our own by spending time alone. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, When my friend, Jihhee, was in college, she went backpacking to South Africa by herself.

"36&A scientist has to share his new discovery with scientists all over the world.

",::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether a scientist should share his new discovery with scientists all over the world or not. Some may say scientist should keep the new discovery as private for its country's own prestige. <TS><TR>However</TR>, as far as I am concerned, I belive it is more beneficial when all the scientists from the world share their discoveries because of: further development and not waste of money.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>In the first place</TR>, the primary reason for my opinion is that we can achieve something better. <TR>That is</TR>, by sharing thoughts, ideas, concepts, and discoveries, scientists from all over the world, can collaborate their efforts and achieve greater succuess.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>To be more specific</TR>, malaria is a disease which is well known as a serious disease that cannot be cured easily. <TR>However</TR>, I read an article recently about the topic of 'development of medicine for malaria'. It states that the medicine called 'Pyramax' was currently invented by the scientists and the result was possible because of gathering efforts and sharing discoveries in each countries.</EX> <TR>On the contrary</TR>, if scientists did not share their knowledge, it could not have been possible to invent something that was breakthrough and people from malaria zone were still in danger.</SI1> <TR>Thus</TR>, I am totally in favor of the topic which scientists should share their discoveries with international scientists.</BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>In the second place</TR>, it can be a tremendous money waste.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>To be more specific</TR>, if more and more scientists become private and not share their discoveries, individuals think that they are the first one who have discovered the subject, and started to invest uncountable money for their own benefit. <TR>However</TR>, what if the subject was already invented by another country? </SI2><EX><TR>Unfortunately</TR>, there was a case of this example in my country, Korea. When Korean scientist, known as Bok Kim, had discovered the first idea about how to successfully lauch the space ship on the moon. <TR>However</TR>, this whole process was operating secretely with governments' financial support from preventing the idea from exposing to other country. <TR>In fact</TR>, in 1969,which was before the period of Bok's success, there was a breakthrough in US about a man named 'Neil A. Armstrong', who firstly succeeded launching on the moon. <TR>Therefore,</TR> all the works and investment of Kim returned as a huge waste, and if he had shared the discoveries with other scientists, he would not have been in such a feeling of despair and loss of money at least.</EX></SI2> <TR>Consequently</TR>, I strongly insist on sharing discoveries.</BO2>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> group travel with a tour guide makes it possible to learn lots of thing about destination.</MI2> <SI2>When you travel alone, it is more likely to miss lots of information and knowledge related to your destination.</SI2> <EX><TR>For example<TR>, i have been China twice.

52&Exams encourage students to learn.,::,"<IN>It is often said that exams helps students to learn. Some people may be opposed to this statement because exams push students to care about scores and sometimes resort to cheating when they are in panic. <TS><TR>However, in my opinion,</TR> having exams allow student to learn more in school because of concentration and going over what they learn.</TS</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, students pay more attention to teacher in class.</MI1> <SI1>This is because they know that all materials they learn will be on test, they cannot be out of minded during class. <TR>Furthermore</TR> scores and credits play a pivotal role in entering good university, and they eventually focus on studying. <EX>For example, according to Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, students who had a regular exam in high school entered better universities than others who didn't have constant test in school.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, taking tests encourage students to go over contents of subject.</MI2> <SI2>One significant reason is that students can remember for a long time by looking over what they learn.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people could get abundant information about foreign countries where they want to know.</MI1> <SI1>There are zillions of articles and photos provided by special reporters and editors who are an experts with certain countries. <TR>Therefore</TR> people could learn from general information such as size, population and temperature to specific information as properties of each regions in the countries and hidden beautiful places where even natives may not be familiar with.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, it has much more economic efficiency.</MI2> <SI2>Learning about another countries from written forms costs less than visiting.

54&It is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than doing physical exercises.,::,"<IN>It is often said that watching a movie or reading a book is the best way for people to relax. <TS><TR>On  the other hand, in my opinion,</TR> exercising is a better way. There are several reasons to support  my argument so I will limit to the two that I feel are the most related to the topic.<TR> First</TR>,  exercising is a more effective way for people to relieve their stress. <TR>Also,</TR> by exercising, people  can make deep relationship with their friends.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people can feel better relaxation after doing physical activities than just reading a book in a home.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that exercising distracts people from worries and stress. This simple and quick escape from the reality can serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> reading a book can stress people due to its complex and profound contents. <EX>According to a study conducted by the department of education of Seoul National University of Korea in 2007, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing academic pressure. Students in Group A exercised regularly and cooperated with each other with playing sports but those in Group B rarely engaged in such activities and just read a book in their rooms. The researcher found that the former group were more satisfied with their school lives than the latter group. <TR>Moreover</TR>, students in Group B were involved in dangerous activities such as drinking and smoking to cope with their stress. This implies that exercising is a more appropriate way to relax.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, by playing sports, people can make better relationship which help people to relax themselves.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that while doing physical exercises, people cooperate with their friends and make more communication each other. It is very imperative because modern society is increasingly becoming competitive. <TR>Therefore,</TR> with such relationship, they can feel more relaxation and consolation, which cannot be made by just reading a book. <EX>This reminds me of my story. When I was a high school student, I felt lots of stress and was nervous due to the lack of relationship with my friends. <TR>Thus</TR>, I tried to exercised every day in order to forget about it. When I played a basketball alone, some friends asked me to play together. We could make friendship easily with playing sports and I could solve my problems.

55&Television destroy communication among friends and family. Do you agree?,::,"<IN>There is an argument concerning whether television destroy communication among friends and family. <TR>In fact</TR>, it is true that television takes people's time to  communicate each other. But it doesn't mean a television disturbs communication among family or friend. <TS>I think television helps communications between one's and other's. I will briefly explain some reasons for this in this essay.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1></TR>First of all</TR>, a television can creates many communication topics.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>To explain,</TR> a few years ago there was a very popular audition program named Superstar K. in every Friday night. After this program, there are many opinion's about the program. Some friends who didn't watch the program couldn't participate in talk.</EX> <TR>Also,</TR> in family members, we can talk lots of things with our parents. <TR>Generally</TR>, almost son and daughter doesn't have common communication topic with their parents. <TR>However</TR>, a television can provide a common topic such as teenager crime or game addiction or many things. <TR>Through this</TR>, people can communicate with their parents, so a relationship between people and their parent can get better. In this sense, television can help to communication.</SI1></BO>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, television can develop a relationship among people.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For example</TR>, many students like sports such as soccer. These students often watch soccer game through a television in their school. <TR>From these act</TR>, their friendship can be developed.</EX> <TR>In addition</TR>, a television can gather a family. In modern society many people are very busy. Since they are really busy, they don't have time to meet their family. But some entertainment television programs can gather some families. <TR>Consequently</TR>, some television programs help family gathering and communications. <TR>Thus</TR> watching television is good at communication with family members.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In summary</TR>, I disagree with the statement that television can destroy a family or friend's communication on account of some reasons I mentioned above: not only does the topic providing function that a television has, but it also help to develop about family member's or friend's relationship.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all<TR>, children spend most of time with their parents.</MI1> <SI><TR>Thus</TR> seeing their parents children learn many things like speaking well, preparing a meal, housing skills, and loves. <EX><TR>To be more specific</TR>, parents try to keep in touch with them as much as possible when they are young and after being able to do something like play with their friends, children usually stay with their parents lots of time.</EX> This is significantly important since that time is much longer than with any other such as a school teacher and they do the best themselves teach well.</SI1> <TR>Therefore</TR> although school teacher have a adequate teaching skill for children's certain age, it is indispensible that parents have more affect on children's life and become the best teacher.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, there is no person who know well children than their parents.</MI2> <SI2>Since having seen their children when they are babe, parents have huge amount of knowldege about them.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, friends significantly influence young adults because of the amount of time they spend together.</MI2> <SI2>As young adults become older, they spend less time with their parents and more with their friends in school.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people who differentiate themselves can have better job opportunities than others.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact when people tried to be different from others, they can develop their specialty. <TR>Also</TR>, as modern society is increasingly specialized and competitive, today's job markets require job candidates with such qualities. <EX>According to the Ministry of employment of Korea in 2004, the employment interview was the most pivotal component in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call.  The interviewers looked at the applicant's knowledge and skill, mostly related to specialty.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, being different allows people to expand their social network.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that people want to make relationship with a person who not are normal, but are eminently humorous or has outstanding skill in academic fields. <TR>Moreover</TR>, expanding social network is an imperative values for success in modern society. <EX>According to a study conducted by the Department of Education at Seoul National University of Korea in 2004, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in the range of relationship, Group A consisted of students who were normal and average-skilled in the subjects.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, following the expression “Never give up” can make one waste his life and time without serious consideration of aptitude.</MI1> <SI1>Loving to do something with passion does not always mean doing something well with competitive aptitude comparing to other people.

As we can often see, people change their mind, way, and goal to calibrate what he can do better. It is not a waste time because once people find their ways that are fit with their aptitude, the rest of his life can be hopefully determined and all the man has to do is to follow the way and achieve goals throughout the remaining life.</SI1></BO1>

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN><TS>There are heated debates over the issue of wether people attend college university to get new informations, career preparation, increase knowledge. While there are good arguments for both positions, the following discussion will explain in detail why I agree.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, college or university have positive effect on people because, unlike friends, education institute plays critical roles in developing peoples' untapped talents.</MI1> <SI1>Modern day students live hectic lives, because today's globalized society is increasingly competitive and constantly changing. <TR>Consequently</TR>, it is difficult for people to discover their personal interests and pursue the field of study that they prefer. This makes it crucial for education system such as college or university to help people develop innate talents and tap into their full potential. <TR>Therefore</TR>, university influence should not be overlooked in this context. <EX>According to a group of education experts at Columbia University, people are under the guidance of teacher in university decide in their future careers and develop their potential faster than people who are not.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, schools' influence cannot be compared to that of other education methods because schools teachers, with their years of their experience, can offer the lessons on morality and ethics.</MI2> <SI2>People who are still mentally immature have a long way to go before they become grown-ups. During this long journey, they tend to make many mistakes, and therefore are prone to misbehave. <TR>However</TR>, they can be guided by their teachers, who can teach them about etiquette and social norms, and thus become good models for society. In this respect, college or university exert great influence on people. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, growing students may give in to the temptation of using drugs because they are too young to judge right from wrong.</EX> This is reason why school' involvement is an urgent need. Whit the guidance of teachers, students can learn how to avoid such temptation and become law-biding citizens, by listening to teachers' descriptions of their own experience.

64&Renewable sources of energy will soon replace fossil fuels.,::,"<IN>It is often said that it is hard to replace fossil fuels with renewable sources, because it costs too much to build facility which create renewable sources. <TS><TR>However</TR>, in my opinion, renewable sources will substitute fossil fuels. <TR>First,</TR> environment problems become a serious issue. <TR>Second</TR>, the amount of sources which is necessary to produce fossil fuels is restricted.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, it increasingly becomes a big issue to protect environment.</MI1> <SI1>Many people know that using fossil fuels can have bad effects on environment.

Moreover, 77 of them said that they have interests to buy a expensive car which moves by renewable energy instead of buying cheaper car moving by fossil fuels. This shows that in the near future, people will stop to use fossil fuels to protect earth.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, fossil fuels are too restricted to attain, because it's sources are scarce.</MI2> <SI2>Those sources exist in only some regions. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, oil which is necessary to produce energy exists only some country and some countries can not produce such resources. Many countries already know that, so they try to develop renewable sources which are common to every countries and exists everywhere.</EX> A recent research has shown that many companies are trying to build facility to produce renewable energy and are investing a great deal of money to develop those things. Some of business man reported that it is a good ways to make a lot of money, because they do not have to worry about scarce resources and it comparatively costs less than importing resources from other countries. This indicates that in near future renewable energy would be substitute for fossil fuels.</SI2></BO2>

Some people can expect that my brother is quite inactive and likes sedentary lifestyles. <TR>However</TR>, my brother also enjoys very active activities like playing soccer and basketball. His close friends are kinds of the book worm and they actually do not like running and kicking the ball, but my brother does not want to be involved in only one type of people.</EX> <TR>In this regard,</TR> one’s characteristics cannot be expected easily though who is one’s friends.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, with the scientific technology developed, people can watch famous people’s lives and it is much easier to say that they are affected by celebrities on TV rather than their normal friends.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To specify this</TR>, some people argue that peer pressure are very critical aspects that play important roles in developing children’s personalities and behaviors. Though being shown in school, this trend is losing its power and work out less than it used to. Children can be surrounded by TV and Internet everywhere and get information about famous people who they like and imitate. They do not focus on what their friends behave and think because the most important thing to children of today is what famous people said on TV yesterday. <EX>According to the research conducted by one prominent education institute, almost eighty percent of respondents in elementary school answer that they want to mimic the way celebrities who they like behave and talk and some children said that they become happy when they behave like famous people on TV.</EX> <TR>In this regard </TR>, peer pressure is not significant aspect that affect children’s lives.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, not only do people tend to be related with groups of various people and get together with different people but also it is not friend who affect people’s behavior or thoughts but famous people on TV who substantially have effects on people’s almost entire aspects. <TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly assert that one’s friends cannot play a critical role in affecting who one is.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"This is a good essay, but it has the same problem that your other essays have: transitions.

72&People can benefit more from traveling around their own countries than traveling to foreign countries.,::,"<IN>For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8000 years, people were constantly curious about other regions that they have not visited; therefore, they choose to travel. Some people prefer to travel around their own countries. <TS><TR>Nevertheless</TR>, I strongly believe that traveling to other exotic countries is much better for to specific reasons: other nations have variety of distinct cultures that cannot be found in people’s own countries and people already know a lot about their own countries.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many different people in many different other regions form different cultures appropriate for the environment they live in.</MI1> <SI1>Unless, people visit the place and experience the cultures cannot be learned or felt. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I have visited the United States about 3 years ago. I thought I already knew enough about the U.S. because of all the indirect experiences from watching American movies and listening to pop songs. Most of the parts were exactly the same as I had imagined, but there were a few cultures they I did not expect. People in the U.S. smiled and said hi to the strangers when they had eye contact. <TR>Moreover</TR>, the most surprisingly, all the drivers drove their cars to the sideways when they heard the siren from an ambulance. It was a mind blowing experience for me. I was not even surprised this much when I have visited the Grand Canyon.</EX> If I only traveled my nation, I never could have experienced such valuable experiences.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, long term habitation in one country provides enough information to know approximately everything about one’s country.</MI2> <SI2>The schools teach the history of the country, real life experiences allow one to learn the culture of the country, and the media provides extensive amount of information about the country. With all the knowledge provided and given from the nation, one becomes to know everything about the country. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I have a grandfather who has live in Korea for 85 years. He even has participated in the Korean War. Because he has lived in Korea for a long period he knows everything: the food, forgotten dialects, and the land marks. To the people like him, the trip around country is meaningless. He always says to me; “go experience the world, where you can enjoy unexpected incidents.”</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO>Traveling has a number of merits and local tour is also beneficial. <TR>However</TR>, people already have abundant knowledge about their countries and they can experience the cultures that cannot be found in their home countries; hence it is better to go on a trip to foreign countries than to their own nations.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, how much scientific research done properly may determine the power of the country.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that countries are competing with these scientific knowledge and information as the technology now has developed alot and there are only a few ways to show their power. All countries in the world live in similar environments, enable people to live in a standard conditions these days. <TR>Therefore</TR> there is only a few ways to make difference, to make science field stronger.

A country can be powerful if there is a vaccine or medicine made for the disease and this kind of work can be done when scientific research is done continuously. In this world today, variety of happenings can occur as the technology has developed too fast in a short while. This implies that the scientific research should be supported.</SI1> </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addtion</TR>, there is potential power in scientific research. <TR>However</TR>, because the effect of the research done does not show right away, people tend to think that it is useless.</MI2> <SI2>Scientific research cannot be done at once, it surely takes long time to focus on a subject, carry out experiments over and over again to make sure there is no faculty and analyzing the result of the research. But science is all related to different kinds of studies, works and daily lives. Research can be done in variety of fields, improving one's quality. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there can be a research done in making machines.

75&The opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people.,::,"<IN>A large number of people might assert that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to older people than to younger people. <TS><TR>Contrary to the popular belief</TR>, I agree to the statement that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people for the following two reasons: benefiting recruitment, and relieving stress.</TS></IN>
               <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the opinions of celebrities are more crucial and influential to young people than to older people as noticing the opinions guarantees success in career.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that the when people listens to the talk of celebrities, they can understand the social issues very effectively because the celebrities usually appears to variety of media and express their thoughts. <TR>Moreover</TR>, as modern society is becoming increasingly globalized and competitive, today’s job markets require a job candidate with such quality to comprehend social issues.  <TR>In addition</TR> as most of young people need to get a job, while older people most likely to already have occupation, the importance and the effect of the opinions of celebrities are bigger to young people. <EX>According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2009, the employment interview was the most important component in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at the job applicant's knowledge and skills, mostly related to social issues such as terrorism or warfare.</EX></SI1></BO1>
              <BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, the point of views of famous people is more vital and powerful to younger generation as the views enable younger people to release more stress.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that listening to the opinions can make people to release their stress when the opinion matches with own. And, young people tend to have more stress than older people as they more suffers from recruitment problem, financial problem, and social problems. <TR>Therefore</TR>, young people are more affected by the opinions as they have more stress to let off. <EX>According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2005, there was a significant difference between two groups of people in managing their pressure.

Both group watched television programs and frequently enjoyed to watch programs that celebrities deliver their speech. The researchers found out that the level of stress of group B more declined by 24 percent, while the level of group A declined by 5 percent.</EX></SI2></BO2>

76&Watching movie in the theater is better than watching at home.,::,"<IN><TR>Nowadays</TR>, many people emphasize on convenience and pleasure than anything else. <TR>Therefore</TR>, their preferences of movie place might vary greatly depending on the individuals’ perspectives. Some people would apt to watch it at their own place and the others might prefer another location. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, as jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I will choose watching at home with the reasons as follows.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people could have more freedom and less restriction (when) being at home.</MI1> <TR>In other words</TR>, home is more convenient than cinema because people can do things whatever they desire without much concern. <SI1><EX>Take my case as an example. I have strange habit with respect to lying down on the floor or surfing internet while watching films. These actions could never have done in the public areas, lest I should enjoy visiting cinema. <TR>More,</TR> I am often prone to change channels when the scenes are boring. <TR>In this sense,</TR> it is more comfortable to watch movie at home, especially, who has distinct characters like me.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI1><TR>On top of that</TR>, people's preoccupation to watch delicate and sophisticated movies in theatre such as action plays is no longer persuasive.</MI1> <TR>To illustrate this further</TR>, just like watching movies in play house, people should experience the same level of amusement and complacency (contentment) of watching it in their house. <SI2><TR>For instance</TR>, as the technology and interaction between different countries has swiftly augmented, immense screens and vast speaker systems in cinema to enhance customers’ gladness have been replaced with rapidly ameliorated house T.V. screen and sound technology. <TR>Therefore</TR>, even though cinemas shrink their profit by decreasing ticket price, it is less fascinating than before the innovation of the T.V. <TR>In this sense</TR>, seeing films at home might be more lucrative financially and physically.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, watching films at home far outweigh being in cinema. <TR>As I mentioned above</TR>, people could watch movie with ease and freedom at home. Moreover, cinema and home screen render same level of gratification to the viewers with invented technology. <TR>As a consequence</TR>, as verdict may still be out, I strongly disagree with the statement.

"78&When people immigrate, should they adapt to the new country or keep their old customs?",::,"<IN>As people have developed the transportation system, people can easily immigrate to another country. Some people may think they should keep their customs for keeping their own spirit and trying not to lose their root. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I strongly believe that people should adapt to the new country for two reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>One reason is that people can build hearth relationships by adapt themselves to new country.</MI1> <SI1>When people try to get together with other people who came from abroad, there are few conflicts for religious reasons. Thus, these conflicts could be an obstacle for having relationships with other people. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my friends who came from Arab country cannot eat pork. When he worked at the computer company, his boss prefers to have office dinner at the pork restaurant. <TR>Therefore</TR>, when the office dinner be held in pork restaurant, he has to avoid. <TR>As a result</TR>, he hardly gives positive impression to his boss. <TR>For this reason</TR>, keeping customs could affect to have positive relationships with other person.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>The other reason is that people would face with problems with the food.</MI2> <SI1>When people move to another county, one of the main problems is the food.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the ability to cooperate with others stimulates the efficiency at workplace.</MI1> <SI1>As society is getting more competitive, cooperation between the workers can boost the productivity.

It is apparent that company with good team work with others has far more achievements than the company who does not. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, according to Korean Statistics, companies that showed more cooperation accomplished 60% more than the group which did not.</EX> This shows that the company that has the ability to cooperate with each worker has more competitiveness.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR> cooperation between each other is significant for doing work with more fun and easily.</MI2> <SI2>As society is getting more complicated, the tasks are getting complicated too. <TR>However</TR>, when people have the ability to cooperate, they will be less stressful. This is because cooperation is the result of social skills of each worker. They will eventually encourage their companions which will give rise to a better and friendly atmosphere. <EX><TR>In my experience</TR>, when midterm exam was just around the corner, I and my study group tried to help others and be friendlier. <TR>Also</TR>, we had encouraged each other with respect.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> There is a advertisement made only for marketing to improve their image of country so that it must be very helpful for other country's people to know about them.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, I believe that most of developed counties have tried to make their own effective advertisement to play in the other countries.</SI1> <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> korea have made our own advertisement with representative things like Psy, kimchi and bulgogi.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, I strongly believe that Advertising is able to teach people about a country due to their production or movie stars played in advertising.</MI2> <SI2>What I mean is that goods and movie stars that appear on advertising mean that they are popular in that own county so that they must be a cultural flow of that country. <TR>Therefore,</TR> as we consider culture as one part of a country,  we can understand about the country better through advertising.</SI2> </BO2>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, parents help us a lot as a supporter such as financial aid.</MI2> <SI2>They had raised and taken care of until going to college, and it costs a lot.

83&People are incapable of being satisfied with what they have; they always want what they don't have,::,"<IN>It is often said that people are unable to happy with what they have. Some people may be opposed to this statement because being satisfied with the present provides stability and comfort to people. <TS><TR>However</TR>, in my opinion, people tend to try to obtain and achieve new things such as cell phone, degree and new apartment because of motivation and not being far behind.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, desire for new achievement can encourage people to put more efforts in their lives.</TR> <SI1>One significant reason is that fulfilling new goals is excellent motivation for people to be successful. <EX>From my personal experience, when I was in second years in middle school, I was a bored student who isn’t interested in studying. My grade was always far behind other students. In summer vacations, my parents suggest that they will buy new shoes to me that I wanted to buy. This encouraged me to pay more attention in the class by asking questions to teachers, going over every night. <TR>At the end</TR>, my overall scores in mid terms had significantly improved from D+ to A- and I could get my fancy shoes. Thanks to this experience, I become into studying, and entered good university upon graduation.</EX></SI1></BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, being pleasant with the present prevents people from high qualified lives.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact since people are over-competitive in a slow economy, staying in one position gives rise to fall behind other competitors. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, one close senior in my university, named Hye Jin, her long dream was to enter Samsung electronics. She made dream come true by joining study group, asking advice to an academic advisor, and preparing for the interview. <TR>However</TR>, since she already achieved her goal, she satisfied with her position by doing nothing. In contrast, her colleagues kept developed their abilities ranging from TOEIC scores to taking online courses at home. <TR>In the end</TR>, she received bad performance evaluation, whereas others got promotion.</EX></SI2></BO1>

<CO><TR>In sum</TR>, I firmly believe that longing for new things is a better choice than staying in the present. This is because it makes a person more passionate and prevents from being behind. <TR>All in all</TR>, the importance of these benefits cannot underestimated to survive in modern society.</CO>

84&Art and music class should be required in young children’s school like science and math class.,::,"<IN>There is an argument whether young children need to have an artistic experience in school. <TS>I agree that schools should offer Art and music classes and help its students learn to value the arts. It is because the arts allow children to learn two critical skills: thinking originally and relieving academic stress.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the arts can be an effective training method to improve creative thinking skills that are essential for success in learning and success in life.</MI1> <SI1>In Art and music classes, students can learn how to express their own thoughts in their own ways while appreciating and understanding a great painter’s masterpiece or an excellent piece of music; that brings out students’ creativity and originality. Creativity prepares them with the flexible skills they will need in other classes including math and science class. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, Albert Einstein, who contributed so much to science, had a great creativity that he even sat on eggs to hatch them.</EX> <TR>Also</TR>, originality will serve students well when they go out into the world because the world does not need Tom, Dick, and Harry anymore. It needs one specific person incomparable to any. <TR>Moreover</TR>, since learning about the arts require flexibility in thinking and takes a long time, it is good to start when students are young, so that they can expand their thinking capability and think creatively.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, enjoying the arts relieve students’ academic stress.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Many distinguished scholars including the above-mentioned scientist, Albert Einstein, who enjoyed playing violin through his life, treasured the arts as a stress reliever, because it refreshed and inspired their minds.</EX> <TR>For example</TR>, when people sing a song or listen to music, the melodies of music banish all other thoughts from their minds, so that they can restart with the fresh ideas after the music is gone. This shows that how effective it is to enjoy the arts as a stress reliever for students.</SI2></BO2>

85&Professional athletes do not deserve to the high salaries that they are paid.,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether professional athletes do not deserve to the high salaries that they are paid. <TS>I disagree with the statement that professional athletes should deserve lower salaries than now for two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, famous athletes can provide big enjoyment to millions of people. <TR>Second</TR>, only a few players earn much money after the severe competition.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, millions of people can be happy because of famous athletes</MI1>. <SI1>Some people might say that professional athletes draw too high salaries. <TR>However</TR>, I will give an example to prove why professional players should deserve to the high salaries. An uncertain and unstable economic climate has been dominant across the world for a long time. <TR>Obviously</TR>, almost every part of the world is affected by a financial problem in one economy. <TR>Not surprisingly</TR>, employers always look for better qualified and more experienced workers. This trend forces job applicants to build more job experiences and obtain more job certificates. Colleges and Universities are also expected to train their students better for their future careers with practical job education. Even employed people also lead a hectic life preparing themselves for challenging and difficult tasks. Like this, today’s millions of people are under a lot of stress. <TR>However</TR>, professional athletes can help them to relieve their stress with big joy. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a few years ago, our county got into the semi-final round in the World Cup because of some star-players’ helps. This result drew big enjoyment to millions of people. <TR>Consequently</TR>, they could relieve their stress and better focused on their job.</EX> <TR>Naturally</TR>, nobody complained about the star players’ high payment. This proves that the professional players should draw a high salary since they give big joy to many people.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, only a few athletes who experienced fierce competition could get high salaries.</MI2> <SI2><EX>One of my friends is a professional athlete who is paid a lot of money. When he was in middle school, he spent most of his time playing basketball. He even didn’t have time to socialize with other people since he needed to practice a lot to get into the high school which had an outstanding basketball team in the city. After entering the high school, he also needed to compete with many basketball players to be hired by professional basketball team. He could be a professional basketball player after this suffering process. <TR>At that time</TR>, he was an only player who was scouted by the professional basketball team in the city. Most of his friends who played basketball with him gave up becoming professional players due to this tough track or couldn’t be selected by the team due to their relatively lacking skills. This shows that professional players should get high salaries since only a few athletes could get high payment.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I disagree with the statement that professional athletes should deserve lower salaries than now for the reasons I have mentioned above. <TR>First</TR>, millions of people can be happy because of famous athletes. <TR>Second</TR>, only a few athletes who experienced fierce competition could get high salaries.</CO>",::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,"This essay is all right.

86&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should not pay to use public transportation.,::,"<IN>It is evident that in our current society government policy has tremendous importance in our current life. Some people think that making public transportation free will cause a huge financial loss for government. <TS>I, <TR>however</TR>, believe that government should make public transportation free for citizens. There are several reasons for me to discuss my arguments so I will limit to the two which I feel are relevant to the topic: the concepts of efficiency and environment.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR> the most important reason for me to think this way is that government will use taxpayer’s money efficiently.</MI1> <SI1>It is imperative for government to allocate and use limited resources in country wisely. <TR>Thus</TR>, it can be said that it is better to make public transportation free because it will increase work efficiency of people who use public transportation. <EX>A recent news report I read on Korea Medical News Network revealed some interesting findings. <TR>Essentially</TR>, people who uses public transportation to work had lower stress level compared to people drive their own car to work. In the study in the article, many people driving their own car claimed that traffic jam causes a lot of stress. <TR>In the result</TR>, they experienced distraction and could not concentrate while they are working. This example clearly shows that government should make public transportation free in order to increase work efficiency. </EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR> another reason which proves my point is that using public transportation will play a significant role in solving environmental problems.</MI2> <SI2>If government make public transportation free, the number of people who drives their own car will decrease. <TR>As a result</TR>, air pollution caused by car emission will be reduced and air will be cleaner.<EX>A really good example can be seen in Pittsburgh, a city in United States. The city made public transportation free to promote clean air in downtown in late 20th century. Individuals happily participated because not only was it free, but also they knew it was for the environment. The number of people who uses public transportation instead of their own car has been doubled. This contributed to reduce greenhouse gas, primary causes of air pollution. This indicates that government should make public transportation free because of environmental issues.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All these things considered</TR>, with the reasons I mentioned above, I believe that I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic.</CO>

"87&Many people have a close relationship with their pets. These people treat their birds, cats, or other animals as members of their family. In your opinion, are such relationships good? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN>Dogs have been one of human’s closest friends for thousands of years. It is not only that limited to dogs, but birds, cats, and other animals as well. Some people even raise snakes in their houses. <TR>In addition</TR>, when their pets die, people feel sorrow as their parents have died. <TS><TR>Consequently</TR>, having a close relationship with pets allows people to feel stability, not ruined, and gives energy. </TS></IN>
          <BO1><MI1> Having a close relationship with pets helps people to feel stability.</MI1> <SI1>People can actually release their stress just by looking at them because pets act cute. <EX>I once saw an article about benefits of having pets. The article said that pets help people to release stress by being friends to humans. <TR>For example,</TR> when a person is in sorrow, pets know that and consulate them.</EX> Everyone might know that it feels like the world is going to end when they are in grief. <TR>However</TR>, it helps a lot when somebody, for instance, it can be dog, cat, bird or anything, stays with them. <EX><TR>Furthermore</TR>, there was a research held by a university to know if pets are influential to a person’s life. They gave dogs, pigs, and cows to children who have mental illness. By playing, feeding, and being friends to each other, the children’s mental diseases were almost alleviated. </EX></SI1></BO1>
          <BO2><MI2> People know the value of themselves when they have a close relationship with pets.</MI2> <SI2>This is especially true to some people who are living alone and old. Most of the old think they are old enough and feel ruined. <TR>However</TR>, when they raise pets, they are raising someone who needs their attention. By raising the pets, people can know how valuable people they actually are. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I was in depression when I was in high school. I cried everyday for no reason when I was at home with my dog, and I felt like I am ruined. <TR>However</TR>, whenever I cried, my little dog came to me and played tricks on me. I was really annoyed at first, but by responding to my dog, I thought I must live since someone, my dog, needs me. This is my experience, but I heard about many other people who were in same situation I was in, and overcame with their pets.</EX></SI2></BO2>
           <BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, having a close relationship with pets is good for gaining energy.</MI3> <SI3>Usually, the animals we treat as our families are very small. By looking at them, people feel like they are looking at their babies’. Some people who do not like pets might oppose to this idea, but their mind will change if they raise pets. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my family first started to grow my pet, Sky, even though I did not like dogs. My mother did not like it either, but all of my family members except two of us liked it, so we chose to raise her. Before I took her from the pet store, I thought I would have tough life. <TR>However</TR>, it was not. She always encourages me when I am at home and just by looking at her, I could gain energy. This is only in my case, but other people who did not like animals at first but changed their minds by raising them would think as just as I think.</EX></SI3></BO3>
           <CO>Animals are best friends to humans. Although animals and humans have different languages and appearances, they can communicate by spirit.

"88&Parents should not allow their children to watch television so that they can do well at school.

"89&Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.

",::,"<IN>Some people think that it is better to stay quiet and keep a friendship by letting a friend make a mistake. <TS><TR>Nevertheless</TR> I strongly believe that the friends should prevent each other from making mistakes even though there is a risk of losing each other, because friends are suppose look after each other, and if a word of advice ruins a friendship then, it would eventually be ruined someday.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, Friends should worry about each other and move forward together in a positive way.</MI1> <SI1>A friend who just let the other friend make a mistake is not a true friend. As Martin Luther King Jr. said “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than the sincere ignorance,” ignoring is not helpful for anybody, especially for a friend. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was in high school, I decided not to go to college and to start to work right after the graduation.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, a friend who turns his or her back because of a sincere word of advice would not stay as a friend for a long time anyway.</MI2> <SI2>A True friend rather feels grateful about the advice and the friendship even strengthens. <TR>To be specific</TR>, according to research conducted by the National Research Foundation of Korea, about 80 percent of the people answered that they want true words from their friends when they are taking foolish actions. <TR>Moreover</TR>, 75 percent of the people said they might feel bad at first, but would thank the friend who has given an advice consequently. <TR>Therefore</TR>, people do not have to worry about destroying their friendship over giving helpful advice.<SI2></BO2>

<CO>Some people do not prevent their friends from making a mistake for some reasons. <TR>Nonetheless</TR>, friends should look after each other in any circumstances and should not be afraid of giving correcting friends because true friends acknowledge advice. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is better to be brave and stop a friend from making a mistake than to let them suffer from making a mistake. </CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"Your thesis statement is very strong in this essay!

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, relationship is long-term thing not a instant.</MI2> <SI1>Some people might think lying is sometime better than telling truth because it's easier. <TR>However</TR>, like I mention before, relationship is not a instant thing. It's more like long-term thing. If you lie to someone for your convenience, it might feel easier than telling truth but once the lie turn out it will make the situation more worse than you imagine. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, telling truth might be hard to say but it is way better choice if you consider the further future.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, relationship is all about the faith. Some people might think that a single lie are acceptable in some situation but it is not true. It is because even a single lie can break the faith and it is harder to back it originally and also it will eventually make the situation worse in the long-term. <TR>Therefore</TR> I strongly believe that we should tell the truth in any relationship no matter what.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"You are saying some good things in this essay, but your arguments would be stronger with examples.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, due to the human network, saying nothing when one does not anything nice to say. As the society is becoming colder than before, many people find it hard to build new human relationship. Thus, it is crucial getting good social skill. Therefore, people should know that one should not say anything when having nothing to say for a comment.</MI1> <SI1>In such situation, one would have high chance of giving inadequate information that can cause a misunderstanding between one and the other. The misunderstanding can result bad effect on one's human relationships. <EX>When I and my best friend was having a conversation about presentation that she made for sociology class, there was not much thing to say for a response to a question, 'how is it' from her. I said it looked okay, and she thought that her presentation was not good enough. Even though I did not mean to say that way, she understood it in the way that she thought at that time. After this event, we both stopped talking each other for several days. </EX></SI1>Considering the human network with other, people should recognize that it is more sensible to say nothing when they have nothing to comment for a response.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, when it comes to reducing stress, saying nothing when one does not have any idea for a response is expected to be more efficient.</MI2> <SI2>As the society is getting increasingly complicated, the number of people suffering from the stress, but the problem is that it is hard to find a proper way of handling the issue. <EX>For me, after experiencing bad result in a relationship with my best friend while dealing with a similar situation, I got to decide not to respond when i am in such situation again. In this way, I could reduce a lot of pressure and stress that I would get when facing such problem.</EX>Avoiding it could be a way and the best solution to this issue can be waiting properly for something nice to say before one talk to the other. According to a well-known sociologist, people who choose to say noting in such situation would achieve the goal of reducing stress in an efficient manner. He goes on to say that it will generally take long time to have same effect if people opt to say something when they have nothing to say.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>Taking all these into account</TR>, we should agree with the idea because of the significance of human network and alleviating stress in dealing with such problem. There is no doubt in my mind that this will bring benefits to people's future.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> people will continue living with their families no matter how they are busy with their work. <TR>Whereas,</TR> people are going to leave their work some day in the future. Therefore, it is important to spend more time with families.</MI1> <SI1>When workers are back home they will be spending time at home with family members. People will be feeling more comfortable if they have things in common, things to enjoy together, creating beautiful memories. All these cannot be done with other strangers. Families have their own unique sense and it is crucial to continue a happy life with them. As spending time together makes people bond tightly to each other, it will be important to be close with each other in early stage by spending time together. <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> some worker-holic people tend to regret the fact that they had treated their work more precious than families. Recent study done by Seoul National University shows that working people are trying to have more focus on family not to regret in the future and also to get help from them as family has a special kind of unique power that gives strength and couragement that other strangers cannot provide no matter how they are close to each other. </TR></SI1>This implies that it is crucial to have a close bond with family as they are going to live together for rest of their lives helping one another.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> the work quality is likely to increase and be beneficial for both work and family if people spend time with their families.</MI2> <SI2>Families can give help at anytime, anywhere if one really needs. Families know one another much better than others do. <TR>Therefore</TR> it is more precise and accurate for family memebers to diagnosis and give advice if one has problems. Family also helps to reduce stress which leads to an improvement in any work they are doing. People have certain limit to rely on their companions and friends around them when they are in trouble. <TR>However,</TR> on the other hand, family is always there, waiting for them and as families are aware of how the one is like and watched as you progressed, it is easier for people to depend on their families. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> if one has trouble with his boss, it will be much safer and relaxing to tell families what is happening as they can forgive if one has done something wrong and if not also they can dicuss the problem seriously and they will feel more relaxing and comfortable, reducing stress level leading to a better working performance as one need not to worry anymore.</EX></SI2>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore,</TR> it is not an exaggeration to say that while people are exploring various sources, they can acquire the skill to sort out proper and useful informations for their research topic from others which contain false and extreme opinion, which would be an advantage for one's life.</MI2> <SI2>To be specific, as technology develops, more and more sources are being created in a daily basis by people varying in ages and the levels of knowledge, and it often takes place that people put out their opinion on the Internet where people usually get information without any approving process. <TR>Therefore,</TR> it is necessary for one to have an ability to select expert understandings on a certain topic in the modern society, and learning from various sources would be a great help for improving this skill.</SI2></BO2>

107&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? First impression tells a lot about people.,::,"<IN>It is often said that people can know what other people's characters like from first impression. This is because habitual facial impression shows their value towards the world. <TS><TR>However,</TR> in my opinion, people can't not be judged by first impression for two reasons; to tend to be misleading and not to show real personality.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> making decision on people's characteristics according to first impression is likely to be erroneous.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that appearance doesn't reflect inner qualities such as attitudes, values, and personality. <TR>Therefore,</TR> people need to take more time to get to know each other. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I entered high school, I met my best friend, named Harry. At first time, when I saw him, I wouldn't have thought that I would be closer with him like now because his appearance looked very scary and cold. <TR>However,</TR> after having some discussions and group presentations, I realized that he is warm-hearted and considerate. If I had made my mind on his character by first impression, I wouldn't have had chance to know his real personality. </EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>What</TR> is more, first impression doesn't reveal people's real characteristics.</MI2> <SI2>This is because, first impression varies depending on people's moods, and it may gives rise to make a wrong decision. A person could be depressed at the particular time that one meet first time, although he actually has really outgoing personality. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> When I studied in ESL class in Canada, my classmates told me that i had very bad first impression that I didn't know at all. They told me that at the first class, I was being very cold minded and not sociable. This is actually because, I had argument with my host family in that morning, I wasn't quite in good mood. However, after spending time together for a long time, they said they could chance their mind that I'm very good and understanding.</EX> This shows that people's judgement based on first sight isn't equivalent to people' actual character.</SI2></BO2>

"108&Schools (universities, colleges, and high schools) should teach students about specific careers and jobs instead of general subjects.",::,"<IN>Schools are often successful at educating their students in a large number of different topics. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I believe that it is more important to teach students with more practical classes related with their future careers and jobs.</TS></IN>

<BO1>             <MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> if schools focus on career education, students do not have to waste of their time taking some classes that they do not need to.</MI1> <SI1>Schools usually require many subjects to students so that they can graduate but the subjects are not necessary or helpful for all students to develop their own future plans and specific careers. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my brother wanted to be a cook but his school didn't offer any opportunity to develop his dream. During then, not many people were willing to be a cook so there was not enough information and chance to learn the professional skills of cooking. His school did not care about student's future plan but obligated students to take general classes which was not helpful for my brother's career.</EX> By focusing on specific subjects that students will be need for their future, schools can eliminate unnecessary classes.</SI1></BO1>
             
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> students will be more professional about their future careers quicker.</MI2> <SI2>If students get education which is related to their future careers, they will be more used to it when they actually start it as their job and it will be easier for students to do something that they did at least once. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my friend worked as internship in the hospital during the high school year, and she could adapt to the hospital easily when she actually became a nurse. Also, her experiences to help nurses motivated her to strengthen her goal to be a nurse.</EX> Previous experiences about students careers show students path for their future and they learn practical knowledge.</SI2></BO2>
<CO>             <TR>In conclusion,</TR> I support schools should offer education focusing on students future careers. By doing so, they do not have to spend their time studying unnecessary information but instead develop themselves related to their future plans.

109&Visiting museums is the best way to learn about a country.,::,"<IN>Many people say that visiting museums is the best way to learn about a country because it can tell what a country is like. <TS><TR>However,</TR> in my opinion, visiting museums is not a best way to know about a country for several reasons : other than visiting museums, there are other ways to learn about a country and museums do not tell us everything about the country.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> there are many other interesting and easier ways to learn about a country more deeply.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that modern technology has developed and we can make use of it. To be specific, by either Internet or television we can have a view on a country broader. We even can find out more specific information about a particular subject and have a better understanding of it as those information can be gathered in a mother-tongue language. <TR>However,</TR> if we visit museums, we would probably have some difficulties understanding the contents fully as we will not have enough time to look at every single content to understand them. <EX>According to a survey done by Seoul National University, people were asked whether they get enough information to learn about a country by visiting the museums. Most of people answered that although they were able to understand a brief background, there were limits to learn about a country more deeply because of the time consumed in the museum is limited and there were difficulties understanding the explanation even if they were written in mother-tongue as words used based on the culture were not familiar.</EX> This shows that people would learn about a country better when they use Internet or television to study instead of visiting museums.</SI1><BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> museums do not cover everything about a country and this limits the understanding of a country.</MI2> <SI2>Museums usually covers on certain specific area or interest such as art museum and stamp museum and even when people visit museums that tell us about a country like history museum, it will do only a little help to learn about a country. When people try to learn about a country they will probably focus on nowadays trend and flow in that country, the modern culture instead of a history a long time ago. <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> when foreigners want to know about Korea, they tend to find more about things like K-pop or Korean dramas in order to learn about a country rather than doing research on the history. This can be also explained by foreign students in my school. They were asked how they learned about this country before they come. They said that they looked for the newest information as those information taught them how the people are like and what their life style is.</EX> This implies that it was easier for them to find those information out of museums.</SI2><BO2>

<CO><TR>In brief,</TR> there are other better ways to learn about a country instead of visiting museums. Finding information on Internet and television will provide more detail and specific ones and also other than museums, through other materials from a country will help us understand more about modern culture.</CO>

Another thing is that what they learn in this period is basic knowledge. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> I think that when people are children, they can learn how to learn everything.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> childhood is the most crucial period for intelligence because what they learn in their childhood is fundamental knowledge.</MI2> <SI2>We cannot learn more about something if we do not have basic knowledge. <EX>Imagine that you did not learn how to use your spoon.

<BO1><SI1><EX>I can confidently say that notwithstanding the considerable influence of teachers and parents, friends went always first before them for my student life.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> children can enhance more creativity by playing.</MI1> <SI1>Learning more means children can know more but, restrictions are also pushed on them. <TR>In contrast,</TR> if children play more, they may find things interesting in their playing and raise many questions such as "" why does this happen?""

However, his mom later told him that he cant make it in that way. By playing with eggs, he could learn more about natures, and developed creativity more. If he had studied at school, he wouldn't have invented great things that led us to huge contribution.</EX> </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> children may lose interest in studying if they start learning a foreign language.</MI2> <SI2>As many students are aware, studying a foreign language is quite monotonous repeated task.  There are a wide range of things to memorize and concentrate on such as grammar, vocabulary, writing skills. <TR>Furthermore,</TR> children like to play. Even if parents push them to sit on the table, they wouldn't be able to concentrate on studying.

120&TV programs and movies are obliged to show that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.,::,"<IN>There are different opinions among people whether TV should play a significant role in discouraging criminal by showing that a good person are rewarded and a bad person are punished eventually. <TS>Although it is true that some people are required not to be judged adversely even if they are guilty, I totally believe that if bad people are not punished on TV, it will greatly have some negative effects on our society.</TS> In this essay, I will present a couple of reasons to support my idea. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> children are the ones who are not firmly mature, so they will be affected by most contents shown on TV.<MI1> <SI1>Specifically, children are likely to mimic plentiful behavior by people on TV because they lack the ability to discriminate good behaviors and bad ones. Due to bad people's nice suits and impressive images made by TV producers some illegal behaviors may seem very cool for children even if not following the rules and putting people's lives in jeopardy. <EX>According to recent news by BBC, sad accidents happened last week. Some children hit other kids who live in their neighborhood but different apartments. They said in police that they just wanted to be shown as a gangster that they saw on some movies.</EX> <TR>In this regard,</TR> TV should know influential and duties to educate children in a good way. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> some TV programs and movies do not have the intention that bad people eventually will be punished have something to do with increased crime rates.</MI2> <SI2>To specify this, some people can misunderstand that a few illegal behaviors are not always punished and even do not cause people who did pay for fine. This gives rise to high crime rates recently. According to recent research conducted by the police department, a certain amount of crime has been broadcasted on TV or was the topic of famous movie. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> 'Ocean’s Eleven' that features many famous actors was considered as a main reason why accidents related with robbing of bank can be founded at many times lately.</EX> Therefore, TV and movies should realize their potential threatening on society and have a tendency to make programs and scenes to encourage sound behaviors among people. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> if TV do not show that guilty people are punished by law, not only will children have misconception about their behavior that they will have but also crime rates will absolutely be soring. In conclusion, I insist that TV and movie produce many programs to help people know that their good behavior will be praised and their bad conducts will be excluded from our society.</CO>

121&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A teacher’s ability to relate well to students is more important than his or her ability to impart knowledge. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN> A large number of people might assert that a teacher's ability to impart knowledge is more important than his or her ability to relate well to students. <TS>Contrary to the popular belief, I agree to the statement that a teacher's ability to relate well to students is more crucial than the other ability for the following two reasons: lower level of stress, and higher study efficiency.</TS></IN>

<BO1>        <MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> a teacher's ability to have good relationship with students is more important than the other ability to deliver knowledge as the prior ability enables students to have low level of stress.</MI1> <SI1>The positive relationship between students and faculty members can create more comfortable and relaxing environment. This helps students to be prevented from getting excessive stress that many students already suffer from. As teachers can easily communicate and discuss class materials and even private events that students might want to share with them when they have excellent ability to relate well to students, students can find ways to release their stress. Stress is huge factor that influence students as it can often make students to have ADHD or other mental illness. <EX>According to Ministry of Education of Korea in 2011, there was a significant difference between two groups of students in stress level. Students in Korea generally don't have much opportunities to relate with their teachers as teachers in Korea manage more than 40 students in a year as a home room teacher. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> students in Switzerland typically have more opportunities to relate with their teachers as the teachers only manage 15 students in a year. <TR>In addition,</TR> elementary students in Switzerland visited parks or amusement park at least four times in a year. The researchers found out that the stress level of students in Korea was 59 percent greater than that of students in Switzerland.</EX> This indicates that teachers' ability to relate well to students helps students to get less stress.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2>        <MI2><TR>Furthermore,</TR> a faculty member's ability to relate well to students is more critical than the other ability to confer their information to students since the first ability renders students to study with higher efficiency.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that when the students have good relationship with their teachers, they can easily ask questions about their class materials, which greatly expands their knowledge. <TR>Also,</TR> the teachers with the ability are likely to engage in active class discussion or presentation as these activities or performances help them to relate well with students. <EX>The researchers in Seoul National University showed that students with teachers who possess the ability have better academic achievements. In the experiment, there were two groups of high school students. Students in group A had a friendly teachers, while students in group B had a strict teachers who rarely related to their students. 85 percent of students in group A were accepted to university they desired, but only 61 percent of students in group B were accepted to the university they wanted.</EX> This suggests that the teacher's ability to relate well with their students creates student's higher study efficiency and academic performance.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>        <TR>In brief,</TR> a teacher's ability to relate well to students is more crucial than his or her ability to deliver knowledge because the prior ability lowers students' stress, and increase studying efficiency. All in all, the importance of teachers with such ability cannot be underestimated in order to make students with no mental illness and poor academic achievements. </CO>

122&Do you agree or disagree with the followiing statement? Technological advances and automation are bad for creating job growth.,::,"<IN>There are different opinions among people regarding whether the job creation is hampered by the development of technology and the automation. It is true that technological advances and automation process have helped people to live more comfortable and also there are several minute parts of production where people can only manipulate. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly believe that in terms of the creating jobs, the development of technology is more likely to bring people more difficult circumstances to get a job.</TS> In this essay, I will present briefly two reasons to support my idea.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> as the machines have supplanted people in working, the work force of people has become unnecessary.</MI1> <SI1>To be more specific, a lot of machines and new technologies replace peoples works. Not only harsh and dangerous works they do, but also general works instead of people, such as driving the subways. This invariably eliminate the position which the workers stand on. <EX>Like the orchestra, which thrived in the silent movie era as the background musics, had declined and lost their jobs with the advent of technology making sound movies, any workers also can lose their jobs with the new technology and automation, which renders hiring people to work unnecessary.</EX> In this regard, the development of technology and automation does not provide people with career chances, rather deprives them. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover,</TR> the machines tend to be more preferred to people in the work places.</MI2> <SI2>The thing is, the use of machine does not require for employers to pay salaries to workers, and this allows them to save their money and lessen their expend. In other words, as foreign workers are preferred because of their lower payment, machines are also the same, so the employers utilize machines rather than employ people as workers. <TR>Similarly,</TR> in the case of people, they can get sick and be absent from their office for several reasons including family events. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> the machines do not so, and can be operated for 365days, everyday, as long as there is not a serious problem. <TR?Therefore,</TR> much more efficiency and the chance to save money of utilizing machines causes employers to use it, not to hire people as their workers.</SI2></BO2>

This is because most people graduated from university have tried to enter enterprises. <TS>In my opinion. Entering small companies will be better for people with several reasons such as low competition and good atmosphere like family.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> There is no heavy competition in small company.</MI1> <SI1>What I mean is that, as company is small, there are no many employees in company so that it will be easier for employees to get promotion in company. Therefore employees can stay longer and earn more money. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> employees working in big company have heavy competition to get promotion. This is because there are many people who want to get promotion and their speck is so good. As a result, their possibility to be fired by company will be high with no promotion. In addition earning a lot of money from company will be hard too. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> small companies have a familiar atmosphere such as family and friend.</MI2> <SI2>This is because there are no many laborer so that it may be easier to get familiar with others.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> the need to employ land for farming, housing, and industry is greater than the need to use land for preserving endangered animals as the human life is more valuable than that of endangered animals.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that human is a superior entity than any other animals, even if the animals are endangered. While human's living standard can be significantly improved by employing land for farming, housing, and industry, employing the land for animal cannot contribute to benefiting human's life. By building infrastructures, farms, houses, and factories, people can create more places to rest, and work. <EX>According to the Ministry of Budget Management of Korea in 2011, 54 percent of available land in Korea was used for industrial, agricultural, and residential purposes. On the other hand, only 12 percent of the land was remained as 'Green-belt Zone'. The zone is a special area where sophisticated construction and hunting is banned.</EX> This indicates the greater importance of land use for farming, housing, and industry over the land use for saving endangered animals.</SI1></BO1>
            
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore,</TR> the need to exploit land for agricultural, residential, and industrial use is more crucial than the need to use land for preserving endangered species since the farming, housing, and industrial land can more contribute to economy than land for animal protection.</MI2> <SI2>As contemporary society is becoming increasingly globalized and competitive, the importance of economy has increased. Land for farming can help economy by producing crops such as rice and corn. <TR>Also,</TR> land for housing can benefit economy by promoting money transaction. In addition, land for industry is significantly advantageous in economy by producing goods such as computers and cars. <TR>Nevertheless,</TR> the land for preserving animals cannot much contribute to advancement of economy as the land cannot be commercialized or invested by any business entity. <EX>According to the Seoul National University, there was a huge difference between two countries in GDP and GDP per capita. Two countries are Japan and Congo. 64 percent of Japanese land is in use for agriculture, residential, and industrial purposes. On the contrary, only 13 percent of lands in Congo are in use for the purposes. GDP of Japan was 830 percent bigger than that of Congo. Also, GDP per capita of Japan was 430 percent bigger than that of Congo.</EX> This suggests that the land for the purposes contributes to development of economy for both nations and individuals.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> advertising is a reflection of custom and culture. advertising varies from country to country, relying on particular convention.</MI1> <SI1>People can obtain general understanding on each country with a ease. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> in advertisement of Kimchi, which is traditional korean food, the background is likely to represent the best atmosphere of kimchi. <TR>Therefore,</TR> it would contain a variety range of korean traditional things such as Korean traditional house, Hanbok, korean traditional clothes, and the way of making kimchi.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> learning about foreign countries from news articles and magazines is more advantageous than learning from visiting the countries since the prior method enables people to more broaden their horizon.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that the articles and writings about the new places contain details that cannot be obtained by actual visit. As the articles are generally written by professional travelers or journalists who design the travel with experts for a long period of time, the articles are highly likely to include detailed information about the locales. <TR>On the contrary,</TR> actual visit only offers limited information to the visitors because vast majority of normal visitors have limited time and money to travel or experience the countries' culture or custom. <EX>According to Hana Tour, a travel agency in Korea, its’ articles regard foreign countries are typically composed by three natives and two professors who mastered the visited countries culture in university.</EX> This suggests that learning the countries from newspapers and magazines are much more helpful in broadening one's perspective.</SI1></BO1>

That means that you can usually learn certain range of knowledge and this is very small amount compared TV has.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> TV has also a lot of useful and advanced information.</MI2> <SI2>Nowadays, TV deals with more and more diverse range of subjects from advanced science to philosophy since TV has many channels. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> since I was in elementary school, I liked documentary channel such as Discovery Channel. As all we know, Discovery Channel has great amount of scientific programs. I have learn many things from that, and it was very helpful for me when I had an interview to enroll to my university.</EX> So, I definitely think that we can learn more through TV than through a book.</SI2><BO2>

<CO><TR>To conclude,</TR> although some people argue that we can more learn about things from books than from TV, I strongly believe that we can learn about more things from TV. That is because people usually spend more time on watching TV and TV also has lots of useful knowledge.</CO>

132&All high school students are required to study a foreign launguage.,::,"<IN>There are different opinions among people regarding whether a foreign language course should be included in curricular of all high school. <TS>Although some people argue that high school students can reap benefits focusing on other academic subjects, such as science or math, I totally believe that advantages that students can have by learning a foreign language outweigh disadvantages.</TS> In this essay, I will present reasonable reasons to support my idea.</IN>
            
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> as the world is getting closer and closer, learning a foreign language is a great attribution to success in ones’ life.</MI1> <SI1>To specify this, students are likely to meet a number of those who are from other country when making out into the real world and have a job in days to come. In order to become much more competitive, certain amounts of knowledge that students study from their major is not enough. This is because lack of ability to speak second language may deprive a person of chances to show his or her great performances in the fields. <TR>Therefore,</TR> high school are required to attempt to encourage students to get used to a foreign language to a certain extent. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my high school have magnificent language programs to encourage students to improve their English or Japanese. My friends tried to study very hard to become proficient in both a second language and academic subjects. As a result, those who are equipped with an advanced level of language are now showing a great performance in their field and enjoying their successful lives.</EX> In this regard, a foreign language learned in high school is considerably helpful for students’ future. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> it seems that high school students will not have sufficient time to study and get involved in a foreign language course because they have to spend their time reading their major books and doing assignments in university.</MI2> <SI2>To specify this, some people can say that university have diverse education programs associated with teaching a second language. <TR>However,</TR> it is likely that university students are so busy with their major that they do not have a room to concentrate in a second language course. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when being asked about studying a foreign language, every university student said that they try to take part in that kind of class, but cannot help but go to the library to study their major. <TR>Therefore,</TR> high school should take an appropriate action to give students chances to exploring a foreign language that they have wanted to learn. Probably, for them, high school life is a last chance to indulge themselves with learning a second language, so they need to receive a foreign language class, even if it is a basic course.</EX></SI2></BO2>
            
<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> it is essential for every high school student to study how to speak and read a foreign language because not only can they become much more competitive with ability to talk to foreign people but also because they do not have enough time to study it when they are in university. <TR>In conclusion,</TR> all high school should provide a foreign language course for students’ bright future.</CO>

"133&Because environment issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.",::,"<IN>Nowadays, thanks to industrial development, people can enjoy lots of convenience but on the other hand, environment issues, such as global warming, are seriously menace us. <TR>Therefore</TR> we need to consider what to do to solve this problem. <TS>Although some people think that they have nothing to do to revive environment condition, I strongly believe that small efforts can be a great help to make our environment better.</TS> I have several bases to support my argument and they would be written below. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> as lots of bricks are comprise of a big building, our small efforts can build up great impact on our environment.<MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example,</TR> if all people use tumblers of their own instead of paper cups which we can use for only one time, huge amount of trashes can be reduced. To be specific, let’s assume that a student drink 3cups of water a day in school and there are 500 students in a school. If they only use instant paper cups or plastic ones, daily 1500 paper or plastic cups are thrown out and when it comes to annual basis, the number of wasted cups would be more or less 500,000.</EX> We can easily find this kind of situations from our routines and therefore we should not overlook small amount of daily garbage that we unintentionally desert.   </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> individuals can make up organizations to recover our nature.</MI2> <SI2>That is, little interests of many people can be added up together, constructing tremendous scale of environmental projects. Nonprofit institutes like UNESCO or UNICEF must have begun their activity from a person’s precipitation and by summing up more and more peoples such efforts. Like this, by continuously gathering many people who are willing to precede environment related activities, individual efforts will not be ended up as just a person’s doing but rather will result in visible effect on our nature. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was in university, I belonged to photograph club. One day, one of club members suggested us to do some cleaning activities, complaining lack of proper place in our campus to take any picture because of too many garbage from here and there, and we began to picked used bottles up in our campus and we posted notices that warns people not to throw any trashes out on the bare road. Since then we could feel that campus is changing. I suppose that if I or that member did so alone, this kind of radical change could not have occurred but group power composed of those of individuals enabled to bring success up.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all,</TR> individuals efforts to revive our environment are very important not only because that those, themselves, can affect our nature in tremendous scale but also because group power from personal powers can bring about bigger results than those of simply summed up of individuals. <TR>Therefore</TR> we ought not to ignore individuals’ great impacts.</CO>

In this case, they may judge women depending on a visual attraction, such as stature, facial expression, and her style. Of course, it matches with her personalities to some extent, but the real personalities might be hidden under the positive portion. <EX>When I meet a person, for instance, I make an effort to know about a person, not only his or her external feelings but also the internal and hidden characteristics because it is very important to “know” about a person.</EX> When we say that “I know about the person,” it does not mean that “I just know the person’s name, face and stature,” but know about the person’s ways to think, when they feel happy and what they are like. In the case that a person shows himself to others for the first time, it is clear that he will introduce only about his strength and positive facets. This applies to an example when an employee has an interview. Today, as the relationship with others has become important, many companies have applied more different recruit strategies than before. They do not hire employees at the first interview. They interview employees many times to know about them specifically, checking and comparing with other appliers and then hirer will make a decision to hire the appropriate employee.</SI1></BO1>

135&Young people enjoy life more than older people.,::,"<IN>Since an increasing number of elders who enjoy thier life as taking a trip, a controversy has arisen over wheter young people are more able to enjoy lives than elders. <TS><TR>In my opinion</TR> people will be happier when they get older for two reasons ; young people have to get a job compared to older people, and older people generally have more money than youngers.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin</TR> with young people have to spend most of their time preparing for their job market, which makes it harder for them to enjoy thier lives than older people.</MI1> <SI1>This is because unlike the older generation whose economies were based on agriculture and manufacturing which were mainly lobor-oriented, the younger generation is living in the information age. Thus, they are involved in sedentary life to prepare for exams and interview to enter the company.

<EX><TR>For example,</TR> my younger brother who strive to get the work is always in library and spend most of his time there except sleeping and having meals at home. So he doesn't have time to play with friends even if he really want to it. In contrast, my eldest sister who already have a job have a lot of time to enjoy her hobby such as watching movies after work as well as take a trip with friends on holiday.</EX> This implies that young people have little time to enjoy their lives in order to get a job in the future.</SI1></BO1>
              
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> elders' having a much money plays significant role in being more happier.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that enough money offer a wider range of options to improve quality of life. Therefore money is essential component to enjoy life. Imagine about it, If you don't have enough money, then, is it possible to do what you really want? <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my grandmather wanted to travels overseas especially in France to go to the art gallery for a long time. Because her hobby was about art work to speak of. When she was young, she didn't have enough money to go to there. also due to her house's lack of circumstance. <TR>However</TR> she always had a deream to achieve what she'll certainly go to the France in the future. After all, she travels after her retirement spending money which she saves as working. So she feels more satisfied with her life to its fullest.</EX></SI2></BO2>
             
<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> young people have difficulty enjoying their lives because they have to develop skills for the future and have less money to enjoy what they want.

136&People can benefit more from traveling in their own country than traveling to foreign countries.,::,"<IN>In globalized society, it is believed that people can get more advantages by traveling in their own country than traveling to foreign countries. Some people advocate that people who tour in their native nation can have more memorable memories. <TR>However,</TR> I disagree with this view. <TS>I firmly believed that traveling another county can more be good for them than taking a trip to their own nation.</TS> <TR>This is because first,</TR> people can have several experiences that they have never done in their own country. <TR>Second,</TR> travelers who go abroad can be more independent.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> they can have new experience by going abroad to trip.</MI1> <SI1>To be specific, each country has their own traditional. If he or she travel around the world, the person can learn about another traditional that they have never experienced yet. So they can have precious memorizes. <EX>At that time, I met many new friends and went around a lot of memorial halls. Through this experience, I realized that I can learn a lot of things such as other countries’ languages, traditional and history by traveling another country even for a short period.</EX> <TR>Hence,</TR> this shows that having a time to trip foreign nations can help people to have new experiences.</SI1><BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> people, especially students can improve their spirit of independence.</MI2> <SI2>In other words, since foreign countries have different cultures and languages, people have to solve their problems by themselves during traveling. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> according to a study done by the New York Times, it revealed that traveling around the world makes opportunities that travelers solve their troubles by themselves. The study indicated that because the native people talk in languages the travelers can’t speak and there is no one who knows them so they should try to make the difficulties right.</EX> Thus, it is legitimate to say that going abroad for trip aids travelers to stand their own two feet.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> it is my belief that traveling other countries aids travelers to get some benefits. <TR>To sum up,</TR> going another nation brings chances to not only have various experiences but also motivate them to solve their problems on their own. <TR>Therefore,</TR> people who are going to travel should consider going on a trip to another nations.</CO>

<BO1><MI1>Students should choose a university with famous professors since they can have high quality of education.</MI1> <SI1>A true education is acknowledging the information with high quality, and this knowledge will allow them to be a wise person. <TR>Moreover,</TR> famous professors are famous for at least one reason. In fact, most of them are famous for their teaching skills, and leading students to be open-minded. <TR>Furthermore,</TR> many renowned professors are famous for stimulating students, leading students to have a true education, and make sure their students do not studying just to have job opportunities. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> I once had a chance to audit a lecture of Chul Soo Ahn, who is well-known for inventing vaccine for computers and disseminating it for free, when he was a professor in KAIST. I only audited two hours of lecture, but it was very impressive and moving that it made me to invent various vaccine programs, not for money but to have a positive world.</EX> Likewise, famous professors allow students to do something they are majoring in, not ruining money and time in a university like many other students. </SI1></BO1>
              
<BO2><MI2><TR>Finally,</TR> it is better for a student to choose a university who has renowned professors since studying under renown professors would gradually lead to have job opportunities.</MI2> <SI2>It is true that many companies are looking for people who achieved higher quality of education to ensure they chose the right person for their company. When applying to have a job opportunity, companies would have the information of each university, and would also know if the university if famous for getting a job or to make sure students truly studied the subject. There is also a policy in every company that how much proportion of people they are going to hire from each university approximately. It is, thus, easier to get accept from the company for those who studied under famous professors with high quality of education. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I attended Seoul National University in South Korea, I majored in electronic. <TR>However,</TR> although my department did not have many good job opportunities, I could get offer from the highest company in my country thanks to my famous professor.</EX> This is only in my case, but many people who attend university who has famous professors also got a chance to get a fine job. </SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1>The most important reason for my feeling this ways is that reading and writing is the basic skills which need to succeed.</MI1> <SI1>Even though, our society quickly changed over the new technology, basic skills likes reading, writing, speaking, and listening are essential to have success. <EX>A really good example can be seen in the Steve Jobs who is former CEO of Apple.

He can persuade his product to the customer because he had communication skills based on reading and writing skills. This example clearly shows that basic skill is related to success.</EX> This brings me to the next reason which I mentioned in the next paragraph.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>The second reason which proves my argument is efficient. If people have a ability to read and write, they can work efficiently.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Take my co-worker Jonathan, for example, he works very efficiently because he has a good writing and reading skills. He always finish his work before deadline. Unless Jonathan, my another co-worker Tom has poor skills to read and write. Thus, he usually pass the deadline and there are many errors in his report.

In many cases, even they know the fact that their friends are good at the subject, they get help from a professional tutor because they believe tutors are better than the students. <TS><TR>However,</TR> it is better for students to ask their friends for help when they need help since students know the best way to be easy to understand, person who needs help would feel free to ask questions, and they can prompt each other to study more diligently. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>People should ask their friends for help when they need extra help in schoolwork because their friends would know the best way to be understood.</MI1> <SI1>Friends are in similar age, so their ways of thinking would be same. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was in high school, I was could not understand the concept of algebra. Whenever I asked my teacher for help, he just told me the way the formula and the way to solve the problem, using difficult words. <TR>Consequently,</TR> I could not solve my questionnaires. One of my friends noticed this, and she said that she would help me. I could then understand the concept and ways to solve the problem because my friend and I had same eye level of looking at the concept.</EX> This is only my experience but likewise, people could easily understand the material when they ask their friends for help. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>People would feel free to ask all questions they do not understand if they ask friend for help.</MI2> <SI2>In Asian countries including my country, it is rude to say bad things although it is true. <TR>Accordingly,</TR> students cannot say that they do not understand the material since it can make teachers angry. They tend like they understand everything teacher said in order to be well-mannered. In a research, students said that, when they ask an extra help to friends, they feel free to ask all questions and ask them repeatedly if they do not understand when they do not understand the concepts their friends explained. In contrast, they suggest that it is more awkward to ask their teachers for help. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally,</TR> it is better to get an extra help in schoolwork from friend because students can prompt each other to study more diligently.</MI3> <SI3>They can stimulate each other by showing them the fact that they study. This is especially effective way to study in South Korea since schools want their students to be a positive competitive companions. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was in middle school, one of my friends asked me for help in Language Art since I won the first place in Language Art previous semester. The questions he asked me was difficult quesitions, and I thought I should study harder.</EX> Likwise, asking help to friends can lead both of them to study harder and have better consequences. </SI3></BO3>
 
<CO>Many students ask their teachers for help when they need an extra help in schoolwork. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> it is better for them to ask their friends for help since it can lead to effective studying.

147&The decisions that people make quickly are always wrong.,::,"<IN>People make innumerable decisions throughout their lives. Sometimes, they make wrong decisions, but many people believe that those wrong decisions are made when people make decisions in a short period of time. <TS><TR>Neverthless,</TR> I strongly disagree with the idea that the decisions that people make quickly are always wrong for two specific reasons: some decision makings are easy and do not take much time to come up with right answers, and numerous problems do not have one definite answer.</IN>
          
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> not all the briefly decided determinations are wrong because some matters do not take a long period of time to come up with a right answer.</MI1> <SI1>Most  of them are extremely obvious that do not even take a second to come up with a right answer. This is because people learn know-how by making similar decisions repeatedly. People face a number of similar decision making problems everyday. When they repeat the problem they learn to decide quickly and come up with correct answers at the same time. <EX><TR>As a perfect example,</TR> there is a problem of deciding what to wear for the day. People wear clothes everyday to decorate themselves or to express who they are. It is a tough decision to make when people first face the problem.</EX>    <TR>However,</TR> people create their own standards and learn social norms throughout their lives and it becomes one of the easy problems to come up with right decisions. When there is a special occasion, it becomes even easier to decide what to wear. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when there is a funeral, people decide to wear black suits; and when there is a sports event, people wear jerseys.</EX> According to the research conducted by the National Foundation of Research of Korea, 90 percent of people spend less than five minutes to choose what to wear and they are satisfied with their choice. <TR>As this research reveals,</TR> quickly made decisions are not always wrong.</SI1><BO1>
          
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> some problems do not have one definite answer.</MI2> <SI2>Unlike math questions, many problems of real life do not have one perfect answer. Most of the right answers are usually the decisions people make. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> making a decision in choosing a field of career do not have one perfect job. Doctors, lawyers, and C.E.O.s are widely and socially considered as right answers for careers. <TR>Nevertheless,</TR> not everyone pursue careers in those jobs. This is because people value many different aspects in deciding their occupations. Some people find their interest to be the top priority, some people find salary to be the most valuable aspect, and others may think the place of work is the most important factor in choosing their professions. <EX>One of my friend who was attending to one of the most renowned medical schools in the United States has quit the medical school and decided to become a singer. Everyone, including me, advised him to change his mind, but he did not listen. As a result, he is now in a band and does not earn much money, but the most importantly, he says he is happier than ever now. His decision may be viewed as the wrong decision to other people, but it was the right decision to him.</EX></SI2></BO2>
          
<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> it is wise to take some time to make an important decision; <TR>Yet,</TR> that does not mean making decisions quickly always end up being wrong, because some decisions are very easy to make, and some problems do not have one right answer. </CO>

148&Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>It is often said that learning about the past is a waste of time for present. This is because in this rapid changing society, people should focus on present to survive. <TS><TR>However,</TR> in my opinion, people should learn about the past for two reasons; not to make the same mistake and to predict future.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> being aware of the past helps people not to make mistakes again.</MI1> <SI1>One significant reason is that people can obtain lessons by experiencing their behaviors in the past. In this sense, when people deal with similar situation in the future, they can know how to handle problems. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was in second year of high school, I and my close friends were planning to go to travel to Japan. I was in charge of making a reservation for accommodations. <TR>However,</TR> when we arrived at the hotel that we reserved, I realized that I booked on the other date. I was so ashamed on myself, and felt so sorry to my friends.</EX> From this experience, I could realize the lesson that I have to double check and never made the same mistake anymore.</SI1></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> we can prepare for unpredictable event by analyzing the past.</MI2> <SI2>It is definitely evident that past events are primary sources to predict the future. Researchers can find the common phenomenon that happed in the past and this helps them to prepare for future. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> in Korea, the institution of geologic research had studied a series of occurrences of earthquake in Seoul for many years. They researched and studied a wide range of past information such as reference book and old document from Chosun dynasty. With these, they reached the conclusion that there were huge earthquake every 300 years. This allowed government to prepare for next following catastrophe in 2010 by evacuating people from dangerous area. If researchers didn’t study for the past, people in Seoul wouldn’t have been able to avoid numerous deaths.</EX></SI2></BO2>
<CO><TR>In sum,</TR> I firmly believe that learning for the past play a pivotal role in modern society because people can have a lesson and predict what it will happen in the future. <TR>All in all,</TR> people shouldn’t neglect the importance of the past information. It will lead people to have a bright future.</CO>

149&Cell phone use should be prohibited in public transportation.,::,"<IN>The development of cell phone has been rapidly processed since 2000s. Now it is common that all most every person have a cell phone for each. With development of Internet and smart phone technology, cell phone used in multi purposes, not just calling to someone or text massages but also listening music, search something through Internet, watching movies, making a note and even more things that we can hardly imagine.

150&It is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times.,::,"<IN>Many people in modern society usually think that a broad knowledge and experience is needed. So they agree that changing jobs frequently is helpful for themselves. <TS><TR>However,</TR> in my opinion, working in a same company is better than working in different jobs.</TS> It is because it can learn more deeply and skillfully about specific technique or knowledge. Also, people think a person who changes jobs many times of being unstable and unreliable.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> working in same company allowed workers to learn technique and knowledge more in detail and deeply.</MI1> <SI1>It is due to that most of technique and knowledge needs time for learning. It is just the case when type of working is very highly technical and arduous. Modern society is abundant of mass information and working in company is more and more difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, changing jobs frequently can’t allow people to have more professional technique because it isn’t much time to learn the technique.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> too many changes of jobs reduce the reliability and stability for person.</MI2> <SI2>It is clear that company regards person who change jobs many times as unstable for doing work and even have some problems about human relation. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my friend wanted to have many experience through change jobs. <TR>However,</TR> after changing jobs several times, he couldn’t get a new job because no any other company didn’t want him because his career.

151&Students are influenced more by their friends than by their teachers.,::,"<IN>Most people believe that students are influenced by their teachers than their friends. This is because teachers usually have more experiences and knowledge than students do. <TR>Therefore,</TR> it is often said students likely to follow teacher's advice rather than their peers'. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I believe students are susceptible to their friends for the following two reasons: First, students spend most of their time together and second, they are vulnerable to peer-pressure.</TS></IN>
         
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> students are more influenced by their friends because they spend most of their time together at school.</MI1> <SI1>They help each other with school works such as preparing exams and doing homework. <TR>Also,</TR> they give advice each other on their problems. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> when I was in high school, I have always struggled to understand mathematics. No matter how long I put in to solve the problems, I barely got the right answer. Therefore, my friend Eunjung, who is math-genius, used to help me to teach mathematics. Also, since she was not good at exercise, I have tried to run with her after school. We were so happy that we could help and motivate each other.</EX> Thus, friends have a huge impact on each other's lives.       </SI1></BO1>
         
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore,</TR> students are affected more by their friends because of peer pressure.</MI2> <SI2>It is obvious that students in adolescence tend to put highest value on what others think because they want to fit in. They want to belong to the group and feel secure when they are part of it.  According to the research done by Harvard Universiy in 2007, 67% of students in teen years between age 14 and 18 willing to listen to their peers than their teachers. They feel more accepted within social group and like to be popular amongst them. Thus, firends have better impact in teen's life.</SI2></BO2>

In this sense, she could achieve her dream being a teacher. In contrast, My grandmother always wanted to be a lawyer. <TR>However,</TR> she didn't have a good environment that supports her dream. she had to work for house chores for her family.</EX> This difference shows that preparing food easily had a great contribution on women's social achievement.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> people can make a good use of time for self-development instead of making food.</MI2> <SI2>Developing abilities for oneself is one of important factor to be successful. by reducing time for cooking, people can improve various skills such as studying for foreign language, working out, and reading books. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> One close friend named Jung soo, he often ate fast food or frozen food for a meal when he lived in dormitory in university. he could have free time by using those types of food.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> we are living in a generation that is always changing. In other words, learning history may only useful if the characteristics of a generation has been repeated.</MI1> <S1><TR>However,</TR> after the revolution of industries, almost all things including economics, society, culture and politics have been changed because the paradigm of a society is shifted from agricultural basis into the economic and service market. With the advent of capitalist society, people should make money, which is the power in the kind of societies, to live and succeed in their life. Such a trend of society enforces people to compete with each other, and the structure of the society has been changed and varied. Today, those who are stagnant in a fixed thinking cannot live in a community such as companies or economic fields. <TR>Thus,</TR> people should make effort to make a difference every day. <EX><TR>In a company, for example,</TR> most of the presidents require subordinates to think differently from others.</EX> It seems that there is no repeated history that is useful today.

155&Children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so.,::,"<IN>There is a debate on whether children should be required to help with household tasks or not. <TS><TR>In my opinion,</TR> children should not help with household.</TS> This is because working household will take time for study and might be in danger through working. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> working household will get grade of students down. To be specific,  As, nowadays, competition is very high among students even elementary school to get a good grade, Their ability to compete with others will be diminished by working. because working household will take time to study away. Therefore they will lose their interest about study. For example, when I was at elementary school, I had a friend whose both parents have working. Therefore he should work most of household alone so that he don't have enough time to study to get good grade. Finally my friend loses his interest about study.

Secondly, children might be in danger through working household. What I mean is that children are not familiar with working household so that they must be clumsy. As there are many hazard things in house, it might be possible for children to be in danger. For example, my brother is elementary school so that he is not good at working household as young age. One day, my brother try to make a food to help mother and he get injury on finger by sword. 

All in all, even though there are some merits children can get through working, we should rethink about their competition of grade and being in danger. Thus, it will be better for them to help their parents with household when they are grown enough.

157&Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. which one is better?,::,"<IN>There is a debate on whether students should take classes in many subjects or only one subject in university. <TS><TR>In my opinion,</TR> students should take a classes in many subjects.</TS> This is because taking classes in many subjects has a lot of merits such as finding new talent or interest and meeting new friends who will be helpful for a whole life.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> taking variety subject's classes helps people to concentrate on class better.</MI1> <SI1>What I mean is that listening many subjects indicates that they are able to get variety opportunity about what is their own talent and interest. If they find out their real talent and interest through taking many subjects, they will concentrate on their study more than before. According to the research of experts, 60% of university students change their major due to interest. In this case, taking varied subjects will be a good solution to solve the problem. This is because varied subject will help students find their own talent so that they are able to focus on classes</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> people listening varied subjects can make many opportunities that can make new friends who can be helpful.</MI2> <SI2>To be specific, through taking varied subjects, students can meet varied students who major different subjects so that they are able to have variety relationship. It must be very helpful for students for their whole life. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when my father was students of university, my father had taken varied subjects for 4 years. One of his friends my father met at that time is doctor so that our family can be cured by him with cheap price. If my father try to listen only one subject, he might not meet the friend who becomes doctor.</SI2></BO2>

Also we call the American movie as ‘Hollywood movie’.</EX> They are all movies but we call them each different ways. Why this phenomenon happens? <TS>I think the answer is the movies reflect the country which is made in.</TS> There are three reasons why we could know much about the movie making country.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> by the ‘subject’ used in the movie tells much about the country.</MI1> <SI1>In many countries uses the specific historical incidence that happened in only its country. <EX>Korea frequently uses the North Korea and Korean War for making movie. America uses Cuba invasion in the movie. By watching movies using the specific historical event, people could know that in Korea there was a war between the same territory, and in US, there was a secrete invasion.</EX> When people know the historical event that had occurred in the country, they could understand the country much well.      </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> even the movie is about the typical event such as man and woman’s love story, there have some difference between countries.</MI2> <SI2><EX>In Korea, much of the love stories episodes are about the permission of the wedding that each parents and even the whole family like uncle do not agree with. Of course a few American movies have the episode, but that is not that frequent or serious as Korean’s. So by watching Korean movie, people could know that the parents and the whole family’s permission is one of the most important thing is man and woman’s wedding.</EX> In other words, they could learn some traditions of the country.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Third,</TR> beyond the movie’s subject, the background elements show the typical things about each country.</MI3> <SI3><EX><TR>For example,</TR> the eating scene of the movie, Korean movie shows people using chopsticks and use spoons on the same pot. That is the scene only can be captured in Korea. The menu of the eating could also tell about the countries which are made in.</EX></SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>As a result,</TR> by movies we could gain a lot of information about the country because many movies reflects their historical events and situation and even in typical subject there are some countries specific point that tells about the country. Also the background elements that movie shows make watchers to understand the country. So I think watching a movie is same as traveling the country.</CO>

159&Do you agree or disagree with the following statment? It is desirable for students to to take classes in many subjects rather thatn to specialize in one subjecet.,::,"<IN>Opinions might be divided over whether it is desirable for students to take classes in many subjets rather than to specialize in one subject. 
<TS>I strongly believe that by taking many classes students can get well-rounded education.</TS> In addition they can discover their strength easily. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> students will have knowledge on many different topics.</MI1> <SI1><TR>However,</TR> some people maintain that taking various classes wastes time. <TR>However</TR> there is an example against the argument. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was a freshman ,my friend who took variety of classes in university know a lot in many areas. <TR>moreover,</TR> He used to help teach his freinds who major in other classes.</EX> Thus, students should take many classes as possible as they can. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> If students take a lot of classes, they would find their hidden potentials.</MI2> <SI2><TR>However,</TR> some people say that it is waste of money for students to take multiple classes. <EX>This becomes more envident through my experience. when I was a sophomore, I spent days agonizing over whether what to choose my job.

By taking lots of coureses I could find what I like and I perfom better so my problem about choosing my career was solved. </EX>
<TR>Therefore,</TR> when studnets take many classes, it can be more beneficial in finding their strength. </SI2></BO2>

160&Why people want to go to college?,::,"<IN>There are numerous reasons that make people attend college. It could be that students may want to experience larger community through college life or education. <TS><TR>However,</TR> the reason why I think people want to go to university is because first, the existing harsh competition in the world rendered high school graduates go to college. <TR>Second,</TR> they presumably want to receive higher level of education just to pursue deeper knowledge in whatever field they are studying.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> competitive circumstance within the world made graduates to go to college.</MI1> <SI1>Vast majority of people within any community are required to work in order to sustain their lives. <TR>Consequently,</TR> it is inevitable that counteless people will have to get hired by companies, and only some portion of the people who outperform others will be hired. <TR>Therefore,</TR> since erudite people with higher education are the ones many companies are looking for. Most people are in rush to receive a college diploma. This is one of the major reasons why students from pre-college courses are eager to go to university.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> college education symbolizes a place where students can learn any type of study in depth.</MI2> <SI2>Since most colleges are able to furnish students greater resources which are required for students to do their research on whatever topics that they are looking at. <TR>Also,</TR> with the greater amount of resources like library and better facilities, students are greatly encouraged to seek higher level of knowledge. <TR>Thus,</TR> it is essential for people with greater desire in learning to go to universities.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>The chief reason to why people nowadays want to go to college is that the harsh competition established by today’s society, pushed graduates to attain higher feats which, in this case, college education. <TR>Also,</TR> the reason can be that people merely want to pursue greater or higher level of education in order to achieve better standard in their realm.</CO>

161&It is necessary to inform others who are influential or will employ you in the future of your strength and achievement,::,"<IN>It is commonly said that modest is the best virtue. <TS><TR>However,</TR> my view is that it is important to tell others who are influential or will employ you in the future your strength and achievement for that reasons: success in career, healthy and relationship.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> when people inform others who will employ them of their strength and achievement has a direct correlation with success in career.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that when people concentrate most of their time on showing their strength such as a good communication skill, responsibility, and honesty, they can attract employer. This is especially true given the fact that as modern society is becoming specialized and competitive, today's job markets require job candidates such qualities. According to the Ministry of Labor of Japan in 2012, the employment interview was the most important component, taking up more 80 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at applicants’ knowledge and skills mostly related to specialty. The contributing factor was that the more interviewees appeal their specialty, the more interviewers     looked at their resume. This implies that presentation of strength is a secure way for people to prepare for the future.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> when people do not inform others who are influential of your achievement, it deters people staying healthy.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that while people interact with others who have a great impact on their life guarantee a stress-free life, lack of showing their ability can stress people out by making them feel isolated. <TR>Moreover,</TR> stress is one of the main factors of diseases through weakening the immune system. <EX><TR>In a study</TR> conducted by Stanford University in 2012, a test on mice showed that life span was shortened when they regularly underwent a series of electric shocks. Interestingly, the researchers found a link between this and human beings who suffered from periodic stress.</EX> This implies that high stress levels coming from lack of appealing of their strength could negatively affect humans, resulting in a shorter life span.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Last but not least,</TR> informing people's strength of others can contribute to building a stronger relationship.</MI3> <SI3>This is attributed to fact that taking their ability related to their achievement other people who will employ them can create a comfortable atmosphere in which people can bond and have a good time. Otherwise, people who are influential or will hire you hardly have the chance to know about you. <TR>Therefore,</TR> through light-hearted conversations, they can be easily connected. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I first met my president of my company, I was very shy and had nothing common in with him. However, taking about my experience such as got prize not only helped me to relax, but provided some intimate shared experience. To be specific, we bonded by having a shares of personal strength. Such intimate communication easily opened up out hearts to each other.</EX> </SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In brief,</TR> advantages of good communication about your strength and achievement far outweigh those of disadvantages of lack of informing others for the reasons I have mentioned above. All in all, the importance of taking about your strength cannot be underestimated in that it can catch two bird with one stone.</CO>

162&Parents are the best teachers agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>Many of the proverbs emphasize that parents are the biggest factor in raising and educating their children. It is presumably because parents are the legal guardians that children rely on the most. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I disagree to such thoughts because parents nowadays are too occupied that they hardly have any time to spend time with their kids, therefore children rarely learn anything from their parents. <TR>Furthermore,</TR> kindness and generousity that parents used to symbolize and taught their children with are all eclipsed by the increasing child abuse rate within today's world.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> vast majority of children base and mirror their behavior from watching and witnessing ways that adults behave.</MI1> <SI1><TR>However,</TR> most parents recent days are too busy taking care of their tasks at their work, therefore children are mostly entrusted to people such as babysitter or teachers at school. This trend enables children to learn most of their behavioral attitude from people who are spending most time with them. <TR>Thus,</TR> it is highly probable that parents no longer exert the greatest influence on their children but teachers at daily care may have profound effect on what the kids may assimilate.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> parents recently are becoming highly incompetent in leading their children to good path.</MI2> <SI2>Due to the highly stressful and competitive environment within the world, parents nowadays are both mentally and physically burdened and stressed out. This phenomenon renders parents to be somewhat abusive and harsh when they are to communicate and instruct their children. As parents are being discuss as one of the perpetrators in child abuse on media, it is highly inefficient and even risky for such parents to deal with their kids all day long. <TR>Therefore,</TR> parents cannot be the best instructor to youngs.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> parents are often regarded as kind and one of the few people who can truly lead children to positive perspective. <TR>However,</TR> due to many problematic factors present in today's world such as stress and competition, parents are no longer very desirable teachers to their kids. Many dads or moms barely have any time to spend their time with children therefore a babysiter or teacher plays the biggest role in educating kids since children are mostly at their attention. <TR>Also,</TR> parents may be sometimes very abusive to children due to the outside factor affecting parents psycologically, thus the best way to do here is to let teachers ,who are the expertises in teaching, instruct children.</CO>

<BO1><MI1>People can turn off the air conditioner and heater while windows are opened in order to decrease environment problems.</MI1 <SI1>Many people are unaware that it is extravagant to commit these actions. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> the government in South Korea realized that there are a lot of people who ruined the electricity by turning on the air conditioner with their windows opened, so they made a law and enforced citizens not to turn on the air conditioners with their windows opened.

<BO2><MI2>Individual people can engage in the ease environment issues by reducing the use of disposable products.</MI2> <SI2>Many restaurants use disposable products like disposable cup, for example. In particular, some kids are not matured enough to have any idea about saving the energy, and they think the disposable cups as a toy, consequently playing with them. Individual people, owner of the restaurants, should realize how serious problems using disposal products can cause environmental issues, and stop using them in their stores. By the help of individual people of the restaurants, there would be much less fuel burnings, which could, at last, help many animals to endure life in Amazon.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally,</TR> although environment issues are very complex, individual people can do something about them on their own such as recycling.</MI3> <SI3>A lot of people are annoyed to recycle, and just throw away their trash in a single trashcan, without recycling. <TR>However,</TR> if people recycle their trash, these trashes can be used again to make other products. <TR>In addition,</TR> recycling can save the money spent on burning trash, which can save the money government spent on it. <TR>Consequently,</TR> recycling is not only that helps to guard polar bears and animals in Amazon, but it guarantees the reduction of air pollution.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> students would prepare to tests by studying themselves.</MI1> <SI1>Normally, students get huge stress from their results of exams and it effects to them to prepare exams by themselves. It seems like forcing students by taking exams, but this is the one way to make and encourage them to study. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my first year at the high school comes to my mind.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> it improves a sense of responsibility when people spend time cooking and preparing for their food.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that cooking requires many obligations such as managing cook time wisely, abiding by rules, cooperating with others. <TR>Therefore,</TR> through consequences that arise from negligent actions, they can learn the importance of obligation. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my youngest brother used to be lazy and selfish.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> open admission policy  provides students with equal opportunity to achieve their dream.</MI1> <SI1>this is because it allows students to explore a wide range of knowledge and fields.

By adding various perspectives to your decision, your decisions can be more objective and you can attain best answer. <EX>A recent Forbes reserch has shown that companies can gain more pofits when workers decided important decisions by communicating and sharing ideas regularly.

I gathered all of advices from them and then choosed  which major is the best one for me. If I didn't get advices, I would spend lots of time struggling on my own.</EX></SI2></BO2>

169&Earning a lot of money makes us successful.,::,"<IN>There is a controversy over whether earning a lot of money makes us successful. <TS>Different people have different views because of their respective angles. As far as I am concerned, I would disagree with the argument.</TS> My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> what makes people feel successful varies depending on their characteristics.</MI1> <SI1>This is because people have different desire. Having a spouse of dream could be the most important factor of success for some people, whereas traveling alone all around the world might matter most to other people. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> what matters most to me is having a peaceful and happy family. For the sake of my family, I would be able to give up my career path. A colleague of mine, however, disagreed with my opinion. In traditional Korean culture, he says, men are responsible for earning money as much as they can to nourish their children and to support their family. He didn’t say that I was wrong. Instead, he just admitted that his way of thinking is a bit different from mine.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover,</TR> when it comes to self-consciousness, having a lot of money does not necessarily make people feel they are successful.</MI2> <SI2>Some people may surmise themselves as not successful even though they are reach. <EX>Professor Lee, highly respected and well-know professor at Seoul National University, recently conducted a survey that asks people whether they think they are successful. He recruited 102 people and divided them into three group. The first group were the people having money more than one million dollars, the second group were people with money less than 50 thousand dollars, and the others who do not belong to the two groups were the third group. The result was interesting. The survey showed that the third group of people, who have money between one million dollars and 50 thousand dollars, felt most successful.</EX> This result appropriately proves my opinion. </SI2></BO2>

<CO>All thing considered, although this issue is not a black-or-white one, I would disagree with the argument that earning a lot of money makes us successful. The reasons are that what makes people feel successful is different according to their characteristics and that having a lot of money does not necessarily make people regard themselves successful.</CO>

170&Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.,::,"<IN>Some people believe that choose to attend schools or universities inside their home countries. It is comfortable for students to attending schools or universities nearby their home. This is because it is close to their home.<TS>But I firmly agree with the idea that attending schools or universities outside their home countries for their study.</TS>The reasons are as follows.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> Study abroad is helpful for a lot of students to learn various languages.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>From my experience,</TR> I went to New Zealand to study for seven months three years ago. I learned British English by foreigner teacher at language school in Auckland. After class I read and repeat English book many times in my room every day. Then I studied English grammar and speaking with friends of mine who came to here for English study. We helped each other to improve English writing, speaking, reading, grammar skill themselves. Also we could meet diverse foreigner people who live in New Zealand .We could talked to them in English. Our English skill can gradually advances through variety ways. It was meaningful time for me to study second language in English.</EX> </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> To study outside their home countries is allow to travel many places such as mountains, river, lake, ocean where we have never ever seen before.</MI2> <SI2><EX>To be specific, When I studied in New Zealand I went to the tekapo lake consist of a glacier alone. There is so beautiful view and lake’s color looks like emerald. It is the best wonderful place I have ever seen before. I could visited various place there. Then I could have precious times that can thinking of my life of future and a lot of things. In addition, I enjoyed many things such as culture, food and people there through visited variety place in New Zealand.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR> travel is important for many student to have valuable times and we can learn tradition, delicious food, many kind of people. Also we can get plenty of experience. It is so useful for student to live their fantastic life in the future.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I strongly support with the idea that attending schools or universities outside their home countries is better than studying inside their home countries. What it comes down to is that it is a lot of advantages for many students to their research. It can learn various foreign languages by hard study abroad. <TR>Moreover</TR> It gives us abundance experience to live actively our great life and could feel many things through we visit many place in abroad. <TR>Therefore,</TR> I warmly agree with the idea that studying abroad is more beneficial than studying inside their home countries for their admirable research.</CO>

<BO1><MI1>One reason is that technology makes people feel lonely easily.</MI1> <SI1>Before people using computer and their smart-phone they tend to have conversation or relationships with other people frequently. Thus, they could share their news and have companionship easily. On the other hand, people block their communication by using advanced technological material. As a result, people can be isolated. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> before the developed smart-phone my family used to talk each other. <TR>Thus,</TR> I hardly feel lonely. <TR>However,</TR> nowadays, all my family uses their smart-phone or computer to talk their friends and shopping. So, I think that I lose my relationships with my family even though share my time with them.</EX> For this reason, people would be lonely due to the technology.</SI1></BO1>
           
<BO2><MI2>The other reason is that technology destroys the environment.</MI2> <SI2>People using the natural resource for maintain their life. <TR>Thus,</TR> they have got rid of the shelter of animals. <TR>In addition,</TR> they make pollution by using their cars. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> when I was young, there was forest near my house.

"172&Because environment issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.",::,"<IN>It is often said that due to the complexity of environmental issues, a person can not do anything about them. <TS><TR>On the other hand,</TR> in my opinion, individual people can affect the environment issues.</TS> There are several reasons to support my argument so I will limit to the two that I think most related to the topic. <TR>First,</TR> individual activities have positive effects on people's thinking and activities. <TR>Also,</TR> there are many campaigns for change behavior of individuals.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> if a person behave eco-friendly activities which looks beneficial or interesting, other people may follow such activities;thus, this has effects on the environmental issues.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that people tend to take actions which are beneficial to themselves. <EX>This reminds me of my eco-project which I took when I was a university student, The project was comprised of simple rules: if a person behaved eco-friendly activities then took photos and sent me them, I gave them 'eco-point' which can be used as money for my garage sale. I showed eco-friendly activities such as riding a bike and separating garbage to people and noticed the project on a university bulletin. Lots of people participated in the projects to gather the points and I received many photos for eco-friendly activities. After all, thanks to people's participation, I completed the project successfully,</EX> This means that if individual eco-friendly activities look beneficial, other people tend to follow the actions. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2></MI2><TR>Also,</TR> there are many environmental campaigns to change individual people.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that to solve the environmental issues, it is necessary to change a person's activity. In Korea, there is a proverb ""if samll things gather, they will be a big thing."" which means a person's change can be people's changes. According to the Ministry of Environment of Korea in 2003, there were many campaigns for environmental issues. Most of campaigns focused on individuals not on social groups or companies. <EX><TR>Actually</TR> in Kyungju city, a campaign to ride a bike was successful because the government focused on a person and promote them to it by imposing reduced tax. <TR>After all,</TR> the air pollution level in Kyungju city became lowest in Korea.</EX> This implies that individual change with campaigns can solve the environmental problems.</SI></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all,</TR> although complex environmental issued can not be affected by a person's activities, such activities can affect those of people which have effect on the issues for the reasons aforementioned. <TR>Therefore,</TR> I surely think individual people can do many things about environment issues.</CO>

173&Parents should not allow their children to watch television so that they can do well at school.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not parents should not allow their children to watch television so that they can do well school. The answer to this question can very greatly depending on individual perspectives. <TS>Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that parents let children to watch television.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. First, by watching television, children can relieve overwhelming stress. Second, children can closer to their friends by sharing the information after watching television.     </IN>

<BO1><MI1></TR>First,</TR> children can find relief by watching television and thus they can concentrate on their study in school.</MI1> <SI1>These days, children suffer from high-levels of stress caused by studying overtime. By watching television, children can temporarily forget about problems at study. In this respect, watching television is a great stress-reliever, which helps children can study well in school. <EX><TR>To illustrate further this point,</TR> let me use as an example the case of my brother. He has to not only complete more tasks now at school, but also has to interact with many people in order to prepare group presentation. When he comes home, he tries to refresh his mind and body by watching television. Through watching television instantly provide an excitement. For a short time, my brother seems to forget about problems he has had at school and gains enough breathing space to look forward to studying the next day.</EX> As a result, parents should encourage their children to watch television.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> children are able to become closer to their friends, which helps children can study better in school.</MI2> <SI2>In today’s competitive society, it is difficult to forge strong ties with their friends. Aa a result, they may feel isolation not only from family, but also friends. In this context, watching television can help children to combat these social trends by enabling individual to have fun with others. According to the Korean Gallup Poll, most of surveyed respondents indicated that watching television is a great way to strengthen with friends. The respondents said that they are able to laugh out together and talk about performances afterward. Indeed, children can overcome awkwardness that may exist not only among strangers, but also among acquaintances, which will be invaluable to children because they can adjust well in school. Therefore, parents should not prevent children to watch television.  </SI2></BO2>
   
<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I strongly argue my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. Thus, the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that the two of my rationales above are sufficiently convincing encough to the represent to the viewpoint of a majority of people who are favor in my claim.</CO>

174&People today would be happier if they have few possessions.,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether people today would be happier if they have few possessions. <TS>I agree that having few possessions would make people happier for two reasons. <TR>First,</TR> desire for more possessions causes serious environmental problem. <TR>Second,</TR> having too many possessions will make people stressful.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> environmental problem can be occurred by desire for more possessions.</MI1> <SI1>Some people might say that people today would be happier if they have more possessions. <EX><TR>However,</TR> let me show an example to prove why having few possessions is better. Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world. Floods and landslides took countless people as well as placing affected areas at health risk. European nations were no exception. Many areas were flooded and suffered wildfires. Sadly, it was extremely costly to ensure that all victims were put their lives back together. Carbon emissions from cars and factories are largely responsible for this environmental problem. Desire for more possessions requires shipping by cars and producing in factories and it will release a lot of carbon emissions. <TR>Therefore,</TR> if people need more possessions, it will draw more environmental problems.</Ex> This shows that people will be unhappy with many possessions since it occurs global warming.  </SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Second,</TR> people will be stressed out if they have too many possessions.</MI1> <SI1>A growing number of people want to live in the countryside since many of them are not satisfied with urban life. To be specific, there are many attractive goods in the city. So, people are easily tempted to buying those products such as cell phones and fashionable clothes. In this situation, people are pushed to buy new items when they are released since old items can’t meet urban people’s needs. <TR>However,</TR> people are easily under stress because it requires a lot of money to purchase those items. Also, if people don’t purchase those possessions, they are not only hard to stay in healthy mentally but also difficult to socialize with people in the city. <TR>Consequently,</TR> many people recently have moved to the countryside since there are not many possessions. People lived in the rural area says that they can relieve their stress and socialize with many people more easily without newfangled items. This proves that today’s people couldn't be happy with many possessions since they generate too much stress to people.</SI1></BO1>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,<TR> I agree that having few possessions would make people happy for the reasons I have mentioned. <TR>First,</TR> environmental problem can be occurred by desire for more possessions. <TR>Second,</TR> people will be stressed out if they have too many possessions.</CO>

175&Games can teach us valuable lessons about life.,::,"<IN>There are many games in our society and many people claim that games are useless and harmful to people, because they cause a variety of problems. <TS><TR>However,</TR> in my opinion games have benefits which can help people to develop the ability of making a plan, and they can also help children learn rules in our society.</TS></IN>
              
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> games teach us the ability to develop a strategy.</MI1> <SI1>People cannot live without planning because they would never know what will happen in the future. So people have to prepare the future by developing a strategy. To do this, people should learn what will happen if they behave in a certain way, and make a plan to achieve a goal. Games teach us the ability to make a plan. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> in a chess game, players should be prudent when they make a decision, because one mere mistake can bring serious problems which can lead to lose. <TR>Consequently,</TR> the player need to predict the next step before acting and make a strategy to win the game.</EX> This predicting and planning can be applied in real life. In a negatiation, one can predict the next claim of other and prepare for proper reacting. </SI1></BO1>
         
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> games are one of good ways to teach children rules.</MI2> <SI2>In our society, there are many rules which people should follow and children need to learn those. They do not know the importance of rules yet because they are still young. Their parents and teacher can teach rules and their importance by words, but this is not enough because its impact is weak and its way is boring to children. One way to teach them rules is games. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> children love to play games and they are eager to achieve their goal in a game. By playing games, children get to know they should behave in a certain way when playing games, because they cannot achieve their goal by not following the rule. They also can learn what the result will be if they violent the rule because they will be receive a penalty for their violenting.</EX> In this way, children can the importance of rules naturally. </SI2></BO2>

Moreover, many people are apt to being attracted by those who is different from themselves. </IN>
           
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> it will be an indirect clue to know friends a person.</MI1> <SI1>As a result, such a clue will mislead people to perceive a person. <EX>In my case, when I was in high school, I regard a student who has violent friends as violent student.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> TV helps people learn by evoking a variety of sense.</MI1> <SI1>Documentary programs treat a wide range of knowledge including flora or fauna, history, and natural science.

181&People learn more from their friends and co-workers than from their teachers and bosses. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN><TS>We can learn great things from someone who are not supposed to be a good teacher such as friends and co-workers. Living in this modern world, it is sometimes very helpful to listen to advice from them. This kind of situations make some people oversimplify the assumption that we learn more from our friends and co-workers than from teachers and bosses. I do not agree with the idea based on three reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> friends and co-workers do not exist to teach me.</MI1> <SI1>They exist not for my study or research. The role of them is to do their best for their own. Sometimes there could be some situations that they can teach me, but this does not mean that we have to learn more from them than teachers who actually are responsible for teaching us. <EX><TR>As an instance,</TR> if one of my friends is very good at mathematics, he or she could help me learning some difficult problems and it surely could be very useful. <TR>However,</TR> it does not mean that I have to learn more from him or her than to learn from teachers whose major is mathematics.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> teachers can teach us much better than my friends or co-workers.</MI2> <SI2>One of the crucial roles of teachers is to teach their own special knowledge to others. We can learn much knowledge from teachers suc as mathematics, history, and computer programming. <TR>Also,</TR> teaching skill is totally different between teachers and friends or co-workers. Since teachers have trained how to teach others effectively and efficiently, most of teachers have good skills for teaching others. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> most of ordinary people who would be our friends or co-workers do not learn these sort of skills, hence few people would have a good skill to teach others. Therefore, it is clear that learning from teachers are better than friends and co-workers.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally,</TR> in case of bosses, they are not teachers but we can learn various knowledge from them.</MI3> <SI3>If I have a boss, it is ordinary that my work is directly related to the boss's work. My boss would have many experiences about what I am doing now because he or she would have experienced the same or similar job before. What my boss gives an advice to me can be very helpful for many situations when I encounter several problems. <TR>However,</TR> learning from friends or co-workers are mostly limited to a certain boundary which is mostly not helpful because most of friends would not be involved in my work. Co-workers are often related to my work but it is usual that they do not have much experience than my boss so they would not be more helpful than my boss. I am pretty sure that this kind of situation about the relationship between my boss and I, and the relationship between my friends or co-workers and I can be easily adapted to general cases.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> friends and co-workers are sometimes helpful to learn something but they are not basically teachers. Teachers are the ones whom I need to learn from. Teachers and bosses are much better than friends and co-workers because teachers know how to teach much information efficiently and bosses have many experiences than co-workers.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> they will be able to get wide experience from their jobs.</MI1> <SI1>It is hard to have lots of knowledge of their future jobs for teenagers from school.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> they can learn the value of the money from their jobs.</MI2> <SI2>Most of teenagers may get allowance from their parents. As a result, there is no chance to know the value of money. So, some of them spoil their money useless things such as computer game or expensive accessories. After they get their jobs, they will become to know the way to spend their money wisely I think. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> before I earn money, I usually spend my money to buy new clothes and do not save. <TR>However,</TR> because of my experience, I had learned how to spend my money effectively.</EX> For this reason, teenagers will be able to learn the value of money from their jobs.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> one would not regret his decision in the case that he has made his own decision.</MI1> <SI1>Most people have enough insight to make a decision, so if a situation was badly resulted in the end, it is hard to overcome regret about the decision making. <TR>However,</TR> even if the aftermath goes bad and it was decided by themselves, there would be no more regret about the decision. <EX>In many companies such as Samsung or Apple, for example, people who make decisions are positioned in high places, endowing enough power and responsibility for their decision.

184&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. Reading books about real events is better than reading books about fictional events. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>There is a controversy between realistic books and fictional ones over which books are more helpful to today's students. It can look as though fictional book is childish and not informative. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I firmly believe that is is better because it can be a help for dealing with stress and improving creativity.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> fictional books are better than realistic ones in terms of stress.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that since fictional book tends to consist of more interesting and entertaining contents compared to realistic one, it enables students to lower their stress by reading. Such simple and quick escape from the reality may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2009, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing their academic pressure. Students in group A who spent seven hours a week on average reading fictional books were more satisfied with their school lives than those in group B who rarely engaged in such activities. The reason for this was that students who reading fictional books got less stressed out by such intensive school classes. On the other hand, those in group B were involved in dangerous activities, such as smoking, drinking, and stealing to cope with their stress. This implies that reading a interesting fictional book can be a effective and safe way to let off stress.</SI1></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> reading a fictional book can contribute to improving creative thinking.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that most fictional books are written by creative person with such creativity. Thus, it is not an exaggeration reading fictional books is the most efficient way for students to develop their creativity.  According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2002, there existed a huge difference between two groups of students in creativeness. Students who liked fictional books were classified as group A and those who were interested in academic books were classified as group B.

Later on, researchers measured their creativeness by certain test which is customized to check the level of creativity. The researchers found that the level of creativeness in group A was much higher than that of group B.  Not only that, it turn out that those in group A had a more potential to solve academic questions with higher creativeness. This means that unlike our common thought, fictional book is more valuable than realistic ones because they can play a significant role in enhancing students' creativeness.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In brief,</TR> some people presume that when it comes to getting knowledge and information, realistic book is better than fictional books.

185&People learn more by watching television than by reading books.,::,"<IN>Some people say that TVs are just as good source of information as books. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly believe that books are more capable of making people more wise and smart.</TS> Since video formed information is not detailed as much as books do. <TR>In addition to this,</TR> one can preserve books over a multiple of decades, a attribute that made books more affective media of information throughout time.  </IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with,</TR> I think books are more capable of conveying information, because video formed information is not detailed as books.</MI1> <SI1>Since books are formed in myriad of words, so the information in contains are elevated, which enables books to portray details that TV programs can't immitate. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> a famous lecture 'What Is Justice?' conducted by Michael Sandel, who is a professor in Harvard University, contains less specified information than published edition of same lecture. When I read that book, What Is Justice, illustrating many cases, examples, and persuasive argument, I got the impression that books are genuinely capable of conveying specific details than the video lecture version does.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> people can learn more because one can preserve books for many years.</MI2> <SI2>Video formed information is relativey hard to convey generation to generation because of the machines that used in playing video is chainging due to an advancing technology. One can't guarantee that some DVD of documentary one had once bought can be endowed generation to generation, because there is a possibility of DVDs will be obsolete, and forgotten. <TR>However,</TR> books have existed over a few thousands years and will exist henceforth. <TR>Therefore</TR> One can pass books generation to generation, provided condition of books is fine. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> I'm going to show my kid my first english book, Harry potter.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> investing in one skill has a great risk.</MI1> <SI1>There are many specialists in the world and it means that it is hard to be the best in one certain field. <TR>In addition,</TR> it is risky to focus on one thing. This is because if one fail in this field, there would be no other way to which one can resort. <EX>In the Finance, there are the word diversification in the portfolio theory.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> a person who is talented in many parts succeed.</MI2> <SI2>Although it is hard to be the best in one field, it is much more possible to be the multiplayer in many fields. Our society needs a person who can do well in several area, not a best in one skill. This can be proved by the fact that many companies prefers one who can do many fields such as a performance in his or her department, skills of his or her profession or even human relationships. And this brings more possibility to promote in a company. <EX>I have read a economic newspaper which states that most CEOs in Korea, did well in many fields. They did well not only in their department -whether it is their professional fields or not - but also in the relationship with co-workers and bosses.</EX> </SI2></BO2>
         
<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> it is true that a person has more possibility to succeed when he or she is talented in many area.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> making loans among friends enables debtors to feel thankful to loaner.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that most people who make a loan from their friends are likely to be those who need urgent money but they cannot borrow it in other ways. In such circumstance, if they are ablt to get a help from close friends, they cannot help but to thank their friends for it. <TR>Moreover,</TR> such thankfulness is one of the main factors to enhance friendships.

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,<TR> borrowing money from friends make people contact each other more regularly.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that most of friends who borrow money tend to have financial problem.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> having similar friends can lower the possibility to sustain the relationship for long period.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that always doing the same things everyday without making changes, they can be easily bored with each other.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> the ability to cooperate with others is not crucial to live a successful life.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that nowadays, most of companies consider more importantly an individual's ability, such as comleting project on time, meeting deadline, and observing work regulation thoroughly than cooperation. This reflects the importance of cooperation dose not outweigh that of work ability. According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2008, the individual's capacity is the most significant factor for hiring in practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final calls.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, price differentiation is one of the efficient ways to solve the congestion problem.</MI1> <SI1>If there is high demand and low supply, it is ordinary that the price go higher than before. This is natural situation in nations which are based on capitalism. <EX>As an example, movie tickets in weekend are more expensive than those of weekdays because more people want to watch movies and tickets are limited.</EX> <EX>Another example is the price of hotel. Even if people stay at the same night in the same hotel, the price of rooms is different based on the location of rooms; rooms with better scenery charges higher than ordinary rooms.</EX><TR>Likewise</TR>, charging higher price to something that is more popular than others is not unreasonable. In this manner, charging with higher congestion to drivers is surely reasonable decision. As the price goes higher, fewer drivers would drive the area of heavy traffic, finally reducing the traffic problem</SI1>.</BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, based on the revenue that drivers paid due to the congestion, governments can invest to intrastructure for solving traffic problems.</MI2> <SI2>Since governments have to distribute their budgets to many kinds of problems, using much money to enhance the heavy traffic problem would not be easy. <EX>If governments can charge for congestion, they can not only reduce the traffic problems but also gain fees. Since these fees are gathered by drivers, there is no reason to invest the money to problems other than the congestion problem. Drivers who paid for congestion can easily understand if the money they paid is used for improvement of traffic problems.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, charging congestion fees to drivers would be a good way to both reduce the traffic problem and earn money for investment to the traffic problem.</SI2></BO2>
<CO>Heavy traffic problem is not easy to solve, but there may exist a way to reduce it. Pricing to drivers is one of them. It can reduce the traffic based on the theory of supply and demand, and the money that is earned by the fees can be used to improve the traffic condition, which can clearly enhance the traffic problem.</CO>

"205&In order to stay well-informed, people should get information from various news sources.

",::,"<IN>A lot of controversies exist over whether we should get information from various sources or just one sources. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I think we are just fine with one sources because, for example, internet can provide us various information, and because looking up information via several sources costs time, and is tiresome.</TS></IN>
<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, I think using internet is just enough to get information.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Modern days</TR>, provides many information with many shapes-for example, radio, TV, newspaper-, but since internet can provide us various forms of information, there is no need to look up for information from varying sources. The internet can provide us information with many forms like video, sound, image, words. I think this aspect of internet solves every redundant media of internet(well, at least for young people like us). <EX><TR>To be specific</TR>, a research conducted in Yale University by professor John Holstein indicates that forms of information have changed along the change of generation. For example, the graph of the paper showed that our parents relied upon televisions, and radios, and newspapers as a source of information, but our generation can get information only from the internet. This need for various media is being reduced, which concurs with my point.</EX></SI1></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, I think we don't need various sources to get information, because I think 'foraging' for information from various sources are just waste of time and waste of energy.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is because</TR> we have to add up many information from various sources to picture decent quality of information. But if we use one source information, we don't have to work on adding up informations. You might ask that the information can be biased, but I think the internet can solve this problem either. The internet can save time and energy. <EX>For example, I was reaserching about various taboos related to food, which is about cultural enthropology. I had to look up dozens of books to get accurate informations, but when I searched about taboos of food in wikipedia, it provided me purely condensed form of information, just what I needed. So looking up internet helped me greatly saving all those times and efforts I would have spent foraging for informations from books.</EX></SI2></BO2>
<CO><TR>In summary</TR>, I think getting informations from one source is more beneficail because,<TR> first</TR>, we don't have to look up information from various sources and <TR>second</TR>, getting information from one source can save energy and time.</CO>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, There is this well-known saying, 'No pain, no gain.'</MI2> <SI2>I am adhered to this maxim, since I realized that it is true. <EX>When I was in middle school, I didn't study hard. Sometimes I even failed the exam. <TR>Then</TR>, when I entered a high school, I devoted myself to studying. Until then, I had a fixed idea that I can make a good guess on the test, even if I don't prepare for the test. <TR>However</TR>, It was not true, and I realized that studying hard is the best solution for me in getting higher score on the examination. I studied really hard. <TR>Eventually a years later</TR>, I could be one of top 5 students in whole grade.</EX></SI2></BO2>
<CO><TR>For the reasons above</TR>, I strongly believe that hard work has to do more with success rather than a luck. Even if one is lucky, If he doesn't work hard, he would consequently fail.

I partly admit the importance of solving health problems in our nation because there are so many people who are experiencing very harsh diseases, <TR>however</TR> <TS>I believe that the environmental issues has to be considered as a priority that government officers should take care of.</TS> In this essay, I will present two main reasons to support my opinion.</IN>
           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, environmental issues are severe problems that it is too difficult to solve in a very short period.</MI1> <SI1>If the government delays solving that kind of problems until as long as they can, it would have no choice but spend astronomical time, money and efforts dealing with environmental issues. <EX>According to recent survey from one environmental group, to restore environment of today require millions of years.</EX> <EX>In order to get rid of pollutants from water, it takes about 100 years even if most of the governments in the world would try to eliminate something make water dirty, which means that children who are lack of clean water to drink have to wait for more a hundred years.</EX> <TR>However</TR>, it is not too late to fix the problems.<TR> Although</TR> it is true it needs a lot of money, time and resources now, we can save such a huge amount of them by concentrating on solving the environmental problems now.</SI1></BO1>
           <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, by solving environmental issues, the governments are able to handle the health problems at the same time.</MI2> <SI1><TR>To specify this</TR>, most of diseases are caused by the pollution of environment. Some of that didn’t exist in the past when people were able to enjoy their lives in clean surroundings and there was no pollutant at all. <TR>However</TR>, these kinds of whole health diseases whether related to the pollution of environment can be cured by paying attention to clean and eliminate the pollutant in environment. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, AIDS are the most critical and fatalist disease that most people think it cannot be treated. But, recent study shows that developing hygiene of where people who are suffering from AIDS have very appropriate effects on curing that disease.</EX> <EX><TR>In addition</TR>, An expert from WHO said if a number of government from the world try to clean its air, ground, river, mountain and sea, it can reduce the finance for people who are sick about 50%.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, the government can have opportunities to get health issues resolved very much by focusing how to handle the environment and develop nation`s cleanliness.</SI2></BO2>
        <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, environmental issues are considered to be the most important matter compared with the health issue for the reason that I mentioned above: if the government doesn`t think of environmental issues as the most critical problems now, it would spend numerous finance and time and by trying to solve the problem about environment rather than the health problems, the government can solve two problems simultaneously.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, <TR>as you expect naturally</TR>, the more people work hard, the more chances they have to succeed in life.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that person's characteristic is also important component in work place.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, We have to increase parking area.</MI1> When company plan to build new buildings, they have to calculate how many people use that building at same time, and should make enough garage at their basement. I will ask the company following this rule. Because it is my rights. If they do not agree with this, I will make groups with my neighbor and boycott the company. We can give them a carrot too. If they make parking area more than they need, and allow people who live in my town using them freely, I will give them some advantage such as tax discount.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, I will increase the fine of illegal parking.</MI2> In my town, the fine is only 50 thousand won which is  same approximately 500 US dollars. It is too cheap to prevent illegal parking. If I double it, more people do not try parking at inappropriate place such as edge of streets. If someone park on streets several times despite of expensive fine, I will cancel their drive license. Because they make other people irritate, the penalty is not heavy.</BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, watching movies that are made to amuse or entertain helps people to live healthy lives.</MI1> <SI1>While watching the movie with happiness and laughter, people tend to forget about their worries and be distracted to think seriously about their problems. <TR>Therefore</TR>, by watching the movie, people are able to relieve stress and live a healthy life eventually. <EX>There was an experiment done by Seoul National University to see whether the mood of the movies affect people in different ways.

"222&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.

",::,"<IN>There are a plenty of qualities of a good supervisor. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>I personally believe that</TR> there are the most three important qualities for him. Even though job situations can be very different, those three aspects are in common. Three important qualities are as follow.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a supervisor definitely needs the leadership.</MI1> <SI1>A supervisor or boss is a leader of a company or a department of the company. A supervisor leads workers to unify into one and sometimes let them get along fine with each other, because there are always some troubles in a group. <TR>Therefore</TR>, a supervisor has to have the quality to handle the dispute between co-workers and make them get along fine again. That is a capability that a supervisor has to have to lead a company with controlling workers.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> a good boss has to be fair.</MI2> When a worker has a mistake, he has to correct the worker as much as he did to the other worker who had done the similar mistake before. <TR>And then</TR>, workers can accept their fault reasonably. <SI2>If a boss treats some worker he prefers unfairly, the others would get complaint and finally they do not respect a supervisor and get in trouble. <TR>Also</TR>, a supervisor has to be a model for workers. When a supervisor respects rules and does his best during work, other workers also follow and portray him a good behavior.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>In addition</TR>, the most important quality, I think, is the pioneer split, because without that mind, there is no more development and even a company might become bankrupt.</MI3> Who is going to take care of whole workers in the company after all? Developing company is the existence of the jobs. <SI3>A boss is responsible to take care of workers, hence he has to develop a company with the pioneer split. <TR>Moreover</TR>, many people work for a company want to learn some specific skills from the company for their career, but if there is not any kind of enthusiastic thing, they would quiet the job and find better one.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, <TR>I strongly believe that</TR> a supervisor has to have the three important qualities; a leadership, good behavior, and pioneer split.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, focusing on major courses can contributed to success in life.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> when they spend most of their time on their major, they can develop their expertise. <TR>Moreover</TR>, as modern society is becoming increasingly specialized and competitive, today's job markets require job candidates with such qualities. <EX><TR>According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2009</TR>, the employment interview was the most important component in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final calls. The interviewers tended to look at applicants' knowledge and skills, mostly related to specialty. <TR>This implies that</TR> specialization in one area can be effective and safe way for students to get a good job and succeed in life.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, pressure and stress stemming from studying several academic subjects at the same time can be deleterious to people's health conditions.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> concentrating one subject guarantees a stress-free life while taking various classes can stress students out by making them worry about how to study them. <TR>Moreover</TR>, such stress and pressure can be one of the main factors of disease through weakening the immune system. <EX><TR>According to a study conducted by University of California at Los Angeles of the United States</TR>, a test on mice showed that life span was shortened when they regularly underwent a series of electric shocks. <TR>Interestingly</TR>, the researchers found a link between this and human beings who suffered from periodic stress. <TR>This implies that</TR> the high stress levels coming from dealing with many subjects can negatively affect the students' health condition.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, advice coming from friends or family can teach students to learn to solve problems more wisely, making them think about their life.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> having lived for a long time, they have already experienced many things such as rebellion, having to fit in and building a closer rapport with others. <TR>Thus</TR>, they have a bigger view on these matters and are able to provide more objective and satisfactory solutions. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, <TR>when I was in fifth grade</TR>, I had a huge misunderstanding that led to a fight with my best friend. <TR>Then</TR>, most friends were telling me not to speak to him first until he apologized to me first. <TR>However</TR>, my grandmother suggested that I mend things up by taking the initiative to apologize first. <TR>Finally</TR>, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding on my part and had I not spoken to him, we have never cleared the issue which could cost our relationships. <TR>This implies</TR> that such advice given by one of my family members is able to help solve problem more effectively.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, with advice of others, students can increase their academic performance in school by themselves.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> such advice can serve as one of the key motivators for students to perform higher and improve themselves. <EX><TR>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2007</TR>, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in achievement.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, young adults can be independent when they live alone.</MI1> <SI1>Young adults can be more depending on their parents as much longer as they live with their parents. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I moved out from my home to live by myself when I graduated from high school. <TR>At that time</TR>, <TR>at first</TR>, it was so difficult and uncomfortable because I had to manage all the house chores such as cooking, laundry and cleaning.<TR> However</TR>, <TR>after for a while</TR>, I got used to them and could handle all kinds of stuff by myself. Besides housework, I could come to deal with almost all kinds of works well without asking my parents.</EX> <EX><TR>On the other hand</TR>, most of my friends who lived with family asked their parents to handle their works even when they could deal with by themselves.</EX> <TR>In retrospect</TR>, living alone was very helpful for me to grow myself up.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, young adults can experience the real life when they don't live with their family.</MI2> <SI2>Experience on the real life makes people to be mature. <EX><TR>Giving the same example used above</TR>, I could experience the things my parents do. <TR>For instance,</TR> I had to rent a room and pay various kinds of fees. <TR>Moreover</TR>, I had to have a part-time job to make up my rental fee and allowance. Those experiences made me think more about the real world, and it made me study harder. <TR>This is because</TR> I could feel that it is not easy to live well without much efforts in the real world.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To conclude</TR>, I strongly prefer to live without families, since it makes young adults more independent so they can manage their own matters by themselves. <TR>Also</TR> young adults can experience the real world by living apart from their parents, and it makes them maturer.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"This essay starts with a weak thesis, but the ideas and corresponding supports used later are good.

"229&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people are willing to try new things and take risks. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

",::,"<IN>It is often said that everyone can live a successful life as much as they hope. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> living a successful life is dependent upon whether people have enough will to achieve their goals. Such will to do unknown things is the most important component in living a honorable life and it give back rewards to people sufficiently.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, willing to try new things at risk is one of the characteristics of people to succeed in life.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> almost all successful people are found to have such personality. The more people's personality enterprising, the more possibility that they tend to put in more effort, concentrate better on their task, and feel more responsible for their work. <EX><TR>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2008</TR>, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in achievements. They divided students into two groups depeding on their characteristics. Students in group A had a high level of willpower to try innovative things and those in group B had no such characteristic, living in a peace. The researchers showed that the former group of students performed better in school and spent more hours studying by 25 percent. <TR>Moreover</TR>, they followed instructions well, submitted assignements on time, and participated actively in class discussion.</EX> <EX><TR>On the other hand</TR>, those in group B dozed off in class and lacked focus on class materials. <TR>Thus</TR>, grade of the students in group A was much higher than that in group B and hired by a good company.</EX> <TR>This impiles that</TR> people with willpower to achieve innovative things can live a successful life.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, achieving innovative things is able to reward people immensely for taking risks.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> because such new and unnoted things are likely to be avoided by people who loves trying common thing without doing at a risk, there is higher chance to earn money other than fields. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, Jun Kim, one of my relatives, was scientist and inventor. He had spent most of time devised a apparatus which can heat water using solar energy instead of electric energy. It was so difficult that many other companies were reluctant to invest budget into such technology. <TR>However</TR>, he invented a solar energy and it was picked out one of the greatest national invention because it could save money and the environment. <TR>Finally</TR>, he eared a lof money and live a successful live now.</EX> <TR>This implies that</TR> doing new things that seem impossible is one of the ways for people to live a respectful and successful life.</BO2>

<CO><TR>In brief</TR>, although people likes to think that everyone is capable of being successful in life and they all have potential to succeed. <TR>However</TR>, <TR>contrary to the expectation</TR>, I certainly support the idea that all successful people love to achieve new things, taking a risk because <TR>as I already described above</TR>, such characteristics is helpful in performing in school and making a lot of money.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,This student has a good vocabulary and gave good supporting evidence for their argument.,//
"230&A teacher`s ability to relate well with students is more important than the ability to give knowledge.

",::,"<IN>There has been argument concerning whether it is more important for teachers to teach academic knowledge to students than to get together with them. <TS><TR>Although</TR> it is true that teachers should play a significant role to provide with how to study and develop their knowledge, I believe that it is more advantageous when teachers try to make students feel familiar and get close with them. <TR>In this essay</TR>, I will present briefly two reasons supporting my idea.</TS></IN>

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, teachers who are friendly with students can have more advantages to encourage students to study more hard and achieve much greater performances in their study.</MI1> <SI1>Once students feel they are intimate with their teachers, they can be motivated to study and concentrate on books they read. <TR>This is because</TR> they are able to feel less pressure and their stress can be relieved. These things are very important part of their student lives. <EX><TR>In my case</TR>, I would have difficulty solving math problems. I did not know how to approach math problem and memorize important equations. <TR>And then</TR> while I was sad because of math, I met a very kind and nice math teacher. She didn`t blame and have any comment on my way of studying math. She always tried to fix my attitude on math and was willing to correct my solving process. That helped me a lot, so I could get very high scores in math when I took the college entrance exam.</EX></SI1></BO1>

           <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, getting together with teachers well, students can develop their social skills.</MI2> <SI2>It is very important to have that kind of ability and know how they behave in front of people, especially ones older than them. When they move out to the real world, it is good for them to learn and experience to have conversation with teachers and help them by getting familiar with. <EX><TR>According to recent survey conducted by BBC</TR>, it is very evident that students who had great relationship with their teachers are more likely to do their job very well in their workplace and have no trouble meeting their boss than counterparts who didn`t do. They are not used to that kind of relationship and do not know how to develop because they had not been intimate with their teachers. This study shows how important intimate relationship among students and teachers is.</EX></SI2></BO2>

          <CO> <TR>To sum up</TR>, teachers can encourage their students to show great academic achievements and make them more socialized people in their community when they try to have close relationship. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is essential part of teaching method and approach to relate students well and keep intimate relationship with them.</CO>

              <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many people compare themselves with others.</MI1> At a school, workplace, or any circumstance where people see one another, they make comparisons. <SI1>This applies to women more than men.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, it is very necessary for older people in modern times to exercise for healthy.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, for older people, exercise gives many advantages.

The reason why I think is as follow.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teachers have been trained to teach students and also have a plenty of knowledge on their own fields.</MI1> <SI1>They can easily explain the tricky part that students usually encounter difficult and misunderstand. <EX><TR>Aside from that</TR>, what if you have a question when you study alone by a textbook, you would spend your precious time to search the internet or other books but it can not guarantee that the thing that you find out is correct.

        <BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason for my opinion is that</TR> staffs and students can better concentrate on their assigned work.</MI1> <SI1>Though allowing comfortable attire can enable individuals to feel more relaxed, this actually can deter people from being tensed.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Another reason for my opinion is that</TR> wearing uniform or business attire can save time.</MI2> <SI2>In this heavily competitive society, individuals have to do several stuffs in order to overcome other colleagues.

"244&Drivers should be charged for congestion when they drive in areas with heavy traffic. Do you agree or disagree?

",::,"<IN>People who have a car would feel the same frustration these days when they drive their car. Because too many cars on the road, congestion problems are ordinary phenomenon and it is not easy to solve the problem. <TS>Some people try to solve the problem by charging fees to heavy traffic, but many people oppose the opinion. <TR>However</TR>, I think this is actually one of the best solutions based on two reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Price differentiation is one of the efficient ways to solve the congestion problem.</MI1> <SI1>If there is high demand and low supply, it is ordinary that the price go higher than before. This is natural situation in nations which are based on capitalism. <EX><TR>As an example</TR>, movie tickets in weekend are more expensive than those of weekdays because more people want to watch movies.</EX> <EX><TR>Another example</TR> is the price of hotel. Even if people stay the same night, the price of rooms is different based on the location of rooms; rooms with better scenery charges higher than ordinary rooms. <TR>Likewise</TR>, charging higher price to something that is more popular than others is not reasonable. <TR>In this manner</TR>, charging with higher congestion to drivers is surely reasonable decision.</EX> As the price goes higher fewer drivers would drive the area with heavy traffic, reducing the traffic problem.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, based on the revenue that drivers paid due to the congestion, governments can invest to intrastructure for solving traffic problems.</MI2> <SI2>Since governments have to distribute their budgets to many kinds of problems, using much money to enhance the heavy traffic problem would not be easy. If governments can charge for congestion, they can not only reduce the traffic problems but also gain fess. Since these fees are gather by drivers, there is no reason to invest the money to other problems except the congestion problem. Drivers who paid for congestion can easily understand if the money they paid is used for improvement of traffic problems. <TR>Therefore</TR>, charging congestion fees to drivers would be a good way to both reduce the traffic problem and earn money for investment to the traffic problem.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Heavy traffic problem is not easy to solve, but there may exists a way to reduce it. Pricing to drivers is one of them. It can reduce the traffic based on the theory of supply and demand, and the money that is earned by the fees can be used to improve the traffic condition, which can clearly enhance the traffic problem.</CO>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, nowadays, parents’ influence on young people is become more important than ever.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> parents can guide today’s children to become model citizens by teaching important life lessons.<TR> Generally</TR>, students are immature and fallible day by day, and at such time, parents must teach them societal values and thus lend a helping hand in directing them to become useful members of society. <TR>Thus</TR>, parents play a significant role in children’s growth today. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, young students may feel tempted to succumb to drugs, especially these days where students can easily get in touch with it.

"253&The best way to relax and reduce stress is by spending some time alone.

",::,"<IN><TR>These days</TR>, the number of study on how to deal with stress has been increasing. An ongoing debate exists on whether spending time alone is the best way to relax and reduce stress or not. <TS><TR>Regarding this controversial issue</TR>, <TR>I strongly support that</TR> spending time with others is more desirable way to cope with stress than staying alone. <TR>The reason behind this is that</TR> teachers can help us to reduce stress. <TR>Additionally</TR>, people can have happier lives spending time with friends and thus the stress become reduced.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, teachers help us to relax and reduce stress so that we are more likely to relax when spending time with teachers.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is because</TR> most students are so immature that they might not be able to find the way to overcome hardships or problems, the cause of their stress. The only thing students can do is just to sigh and regret their wrong doings, which make it more difficult to relax and resolve the problem. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, teachers who have more insights into life and watch students carefully can be of great help, because they can motivate students to fix the problems and help them to be relaxed and comfortable. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was in the high school, I had a friend who was in trouble because of other friends' bulling at school. As he could not find the way, he just felt stressed from others' offensive behaviors. <TR>However</TR>, my teacher treated the measure behind him and helped him to feel confidence and comfortable to spend his time in the classroom.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, television advertisement can lead children to put in danger.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is because children</TR>, especially under the age of five, are too immature to tell the reality from the visionary situation. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, producers who make television commercials strive to attract children's attention and make them get engrossed in characters in advertisements in order to make more profits.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, television advertisement makes children and parents lavish the money.</MI2> <SI2>It is impossible for children under the age of five to care about whether this product is really necessary for them.

His parents refuse to purchase his all requests at the first time but not too long, they always buy them after all. The problem is that such toys he get to obtain go back to the storage very soon and their parents become frustrated.

"266&Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Other universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
",::,"<IN>University’s main reason is to learn a specialized field so that students increase their knowledge of their own field. <TR>Based on this opinion</TR>, some people think taking as many classes for students’ own subjects as possible is very important. <TR>However</TR>, there are other different opinions that taking various kinds of subjects are better for university students. <TS><TR>In my opinion</TR>, <TR>I think</TR> taking many different classes is better for students due to three reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, taking different kinds of classes can widen students’ background knowledge.</MI1> By taking different kinds of classes, students can learn various kinds of background knowledge. <SI1>Understanding different knowledge and experience different subjects are very useful not only for students’ background knowledge but also studying their own subjects. Taking subjects of different fields can be background knowledge. <EX>Creative idea of Steve Jobs, one of the best well known CEO in the world, is based on his knowledge about liberality. <TR>Although</TR> he starts his company with computer programmer background, he could create beautiful products because he could mix the technique with liberality which he had taken from a university class.</EX> <TR>Likewise</TR>, learning about different field can finally help learn or apply to students’ own field.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, university students can communicate with others with different interest and knowledge by having various kinds of classes.</MI2> No one would agree that studying one’s major is the only reason that universities exist. <SI2>There are several other important roles for universities and learning communication skills is one of them. Communication skill is very important during people’s life and universities are very good place to learn about it. By taking different classes, students can take part in a variety of team works such as making a report with their team members or going to the historical places with team members during a history class. While students try to do their own part during different kinds of classes, they can learn how to communicate with others, how to solve discuss with others, and how to solve problems when argues occur. These activities are definitely helpful for students.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, students can make sure their major is really what they want while they take other classes.</MI3> <SI3>Many students enter universities because they want to learn more about what they are interested in. <TR>However</TR>, not all students choose a right major that they really want to learn. Some students finally understand that they did not like the major they are taking after entering universities and learn about their special field. Others change their mind because they find some field that are more interesting than the field the students are now taking. Students can quickly fix these mistakes by taking different subjects during the very first season. <TR>By taking different subjects</TR>, students can really know what they are interested in, and if they really want to keep or change their major. In this manner, studying other fields would be useful.</SI3></BO3>

<CO>All three reasons are necessary reasons for students to learn about knowledge that are not directly related to their own major. Learning other majors will finally help students’ own major. <TR>Also</TR>, students can learn better communication skills and experience other students with different background. Students can understand if their major is what they really need to learn. <TR>For these reasons</TR>, <TR>I think</TR> learning other classes with different subjects are important for students’ university life.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many leaders in all over the world have no norms collectively.</MI1> <SI1>The country that used fossil fuels is different from their situation.

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the media corporations tend to give some information favor of certain person or companies.</MI1> <SI1>We can see several media companies owned by private and they keep very close relationship with other companies in different sector.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, students share more things in common with their friends unlike with their teachers.</MI1> <SI1>Students go to school everyday and they spend most of their time there with friends. They are all in same situation, having similar problems and thoughts, <TR>and therefore</TR> it is easy for them to share their opinions with friends. By sharing common things with friends, students tend to believe and trust each other, depending on one another.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a feeling of satisfaction is essential for living a successful life, <TR>that is</TR>, living a affluent life.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Putting it differently</TR>, not knowing about satisfaction can mean that you are poor all the time.

<BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason</TR> why I choose the hard work to succeed is that people can get a self confedence with hard work.</MI1> <SI1>If people have worked very hard and they can't gain any resalt and any achievement, they will so disappoint that they are tired of most things. <TR>Thus</TR> they will not be challenge any job and they will believe only luck.</SI1> <TR>However</TR>, if people can gain some resalts with their hard work, they will feel worth of their effort and they will endeavor more than before. </BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, people who was born in rich parents usually has many resources to succeed.</MI1> <SI1>They have the chance to attend good colleges or can be taught by excellent teachers in a private school, attaing good prestige.

<BO2><MI2>Another reason why success has anything with luck is that people who succeed meet usually a suitable period.</MI2> <SI2>Although people has many efforts in their subjects, they may fail or drop in a situation.

<BO1><MI1>There must be many advantages that are expected to be acquired by the presence of a large factory.</MI1> <SI1><TR>First of all</TR>, new large scale factory will need a lot of workers who will be in charge of the production, management, and other kinds of task in the factory.

"301&Business should do anything they can to make a profit. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position. 

",::,"<IN>It is commonly said that the purpose of business is to make a profit, what is a definitely correct.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, if the place in which business is performing to make a profit is defined “economy”, like many other fields, there will exist law, which is a regulating system.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Thus</TR> if a company is allowed whatever they can do for their profit, it is highly possible that the law will be violated because a company’s primary purpose is money. And that means order of a society and its economy is destroyed, which can lead to harm company itself too. <TR>Therefore</TR> while business is pursuing its profit, observing the law or as a broader meaning “order” is a essential point. <EX>Take a look at this case. One company tries to put away with industrial waste, which is extremely harmful to surrounding environment. Without law or regulating its activity, that company will let it out with no any stumbling block.</ES></SI1> And as anybody will agree, that definitely should not happen! </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, if we leave companies do whatever they like to do in order to make a profit, they will put their primary concern on money not customer.</MI2> <SI2>They don’t need to concentrate on research for the purpose of improving the quality of their product, nor have to consider the convenience of the buyer. The protagonist in economy I think is not a company but a customer. <TR>Therefore</TR> a producer should always think of what people want and make such goods as they like but company like.</SI2> Through those processes, economy will grow and it will do good to both of them, </BO2>

<CO><TR>So far</TR>, I mentioned 2 reasons why business should not do anything to make a profit. <TR>First</TR> one was because, by doing so, law would mean nothing so that society might void of order. <TR>Second</TR> one was that consumer is the primary concern in economy otherwise company do whatever they like to and do not think of consumer, <TR>consequently</TR> leading to lack of interdependence and no communication between a company and a buyer.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN>Most parents seem to believe that high schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, I suppose that most of selected subjects will be English and math.</MI1> <SI1><TR>That is to say</TR>, because students are concerned with the entrance exam, the effect of allowing students to select courses is humble. <EX>For example, after the entrance exam did not include the second language, its classes mostly disappear in high schools. </EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>In some or most aspects, science and mathematics are more influential on human life than history and literature.</MI2> <SI2><TR>For example</TR>, we turn on TV to watch the news program when we awake, use a machine to toast bread, start a car to get to the workplace, and boot a computer to begin daily works in every day.

This is especially true given the fact that in the early 20th century, catastrophic events such as world war frequently occured. <TR>Moreover</TR>, students in Group B were involved in dangerous activities such as smoking, drinking and stealing to cope with their stress.</EX></SI1> This directly indicates that living in today's world make people to be more healthy.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, life in the 21st century enables people to have happy and therefore healthier life.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that in these days there are more abundance in terms of finance. <TR>To be specific</TR>, the world's GDP in 1950s was approximately 40% of that of today's. The money tends to represent their power in society by showing their ability to attain whatever they want ranging from fancy cars to even trust in realtionships. This is evident given the fact that modern society runs on materialism. <EX>According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea in 2009, there was a huge difference between two groups of employees in happy index. Employees in Group A who is currently a working man owned a house and those in Group B who were working man in the mid-20th century rented a house. In the mid-20th century, a number of people in the U.S. lost their home because of the bankrun incidents and economy crisis that was very often at that time. The researchers showed that the level of happiness of Group A was much higher than that of Group B. The happiness and health has dicrect correlation as stress that derived from lack of happiness weakens immune system of body. <TR>Moreover</TR>, more than 60 percent of the employees in Group B underwent severe depression. They constantly worried about paying rent in order to maintain a roof over their head and to care their family.</EX></SI2> This shows that living in modern epoch is more easier and happier.

<CO><TR>In brief</TR>, although many people argue that it is easier to maintain health in the past than in today, the benefit of living in the present time far outweigh the benefit of living in the past in terms of health. <TR>All in all</TR>, the importance of relieved stress and increase finance abundance in modern era cannot be underestimated in order to have healthier life.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>As a Korean</TR>, I remember I was loved by many neighbors as well as my mother.</MI1><SI1>There's a saying that ""Nearby neighbors sometimes are better than indifferent relatives"".

That's how good relationship between neighbors starts. <EX>My mom sometimes leave a message saying "" Keys to home are nextdoors"".

"378&Teachers should not make their social and political opinions known to students in the classroom.

",::,"<IN>An ongoing debate exists on whether teachers should not tell their social and political opinions to students in the classroom. <TS>Regarding this controversial issue, I strongly support that teachers can teach students by giving their own views in the classroom.</TS> The reason behind this is that showing social issues and views to students is one of important parts of education. Additionally, it helps students to develop their own opinion.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, teachers should show their social and political views to students in the class since demonstrating own view to public is necessitate part of students' learning.</MI1><SI1>Some people may argue that it will lead students to have biased view to the society especially controversial political and social issues. <TR>However</TR>, before this concern occurs, teachers are of greater help because they can show how to present their critical opinions by explaining step by step. <TR>In turn</TR> students learn how to deal with the argument in a logical way not just insisting their views. <EX><TR>According to the study released by the Bain and Company</TR>, most surveyed respondents state that the key to their success to show their own opinions on the public stage with social issues is hands-on lessons in the classroom at school days. <TR>To specific</TR>, they were able to learn how to attract opponents' attentions and how to employ proper implements that support their social and political opinions. </EX></SI1> If had not been for their learning in the classroom, they would not have performed the address on their social opinion effectively.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, if teachers make their social and political opinion in the classroom, students can encourage to make their own voices onto social and political issues.</MI2><SI2>In the classroom students are given the chance to learn extensive views of social issues which are designed well to understand in the appropriate way. Students can make their own decision on the base of these evidences given by teachers, and can compare teachers' views on the certain issue with their standpoints. <EX><TR>From my own experience</TR>, when I was in the middle school, one day my teacher took the social issue whether government should spend more money on expending zoo. <TR>As long as she explained both sides of argument</TR>, I decided my view with ease and was able to enhance my argument by comparing my teacher's view opposite my viewpoint.</EX></SI2><TR>In this way</TR>, appealing teachers' view on social and political issue in the classroom is helpful to make students' own thinking process and results.</BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people can overcome their difficulties more easily when they are with friends.</MI1><SI1> This is because as they concern about their friends, they are the ones who watch them closely and motivate them not to discourage ahead of difficulties. <TR>Moreover</TR>, they have a deep understanding about friends' situation and preferences so that they are likely to find out what they really need more than when they contemplate the solution by themselves. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my brother had a hard time with the bad grade in Math when he was in high school.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, when they are alone, people are less able to overcome the bad feelings.</MI2><SI2>Some people may say that it is more convenient to leave alone to release worries and stay calm out of stress. <TR>However</TR>, in most cases people fall into deeper dispression staying alone; it makes necessary to be surrounded by many people that allows people in worries to get distracted from melancoly feelings by doing other things. <EX><TR>According to the report released by the National Psychology Institution in Korea</TR>, most experts suggest that the best remedy for people who are in depression is to find other people who can share their feelings. This is because people easily tend to get engrossed in their bad emotion and think it more serious and lament than the real when they are alone. </EX></SI2> <TR>In this sense</TR> it would be unreasonable to argue that spending time alone is desirable to release all stress and stay relaxed.</BO2>

<CO><TR>In a nutshell</TR>, I have no doubt that people are better to spend their time with others in order to relax and reduce stress. This is because people can obtain more practical way to overcome their difficult with friends' help. <TR>What's more</TR>, spending time alone may lead people to bigger worrisome and thus hinder to relax themselves. <TR>All in all</TR>, the importance of time people spend relating with others should not be overlooked for keeping our mental health.</CO>

380&the decisions that people make quickly are always wrong.,::,"<IN>Surrounded by too many things to deal with, nowadays people are usually forced to make quick decisions. They firmly believe that they have made a wise decision and feel proud of their decision-making faculties. <TS>However, in my opinion, a quick decision, which is resulted from lacking of enough time and calmness, always misleads people to failure.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, we cannot understand the situation well without enough time.</MI1><SI1> All of the things have advantages and disadvantages. Only we ponder about the situation for a long time, can we make wise decisions. <EX><TR>To illustrate</TR>, in 2008, Korea Bank, which is the central bank in South Korea, decided to mingle and administer Rimman Brothers.

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, impulsive emotions make us blind.</MI2><SI2>People without cold brain do not observe the situation objectively so that they have difficulties in making good decisions. <EX>Take my sister’s experience as an example.

381&The news media is a reliable source of unbiased information.,::,"<IN>In today's complicated society, it is believed that the information that new media offer to civic people is trustworthy. Some people advocate that a number of contents and vivid spot materials make them reliable. <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this view. I firmly believe that people should not believe the new media completely. <TR>This is because first</TR>, articles by new media are also made by humans with diverse views and second, it can sometimes federate with a government or a company.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, articles cannot include perfectly objective coverage.</MI1><SI1> It is because most contents new media convey also made by reporters like historian who wrote many ancient books. <TR>That is</TR>, all articles are not raw truth as they need to be processed to be able to offered precisely with specific views. <TR>Then</TR>, they are framed into a reporter's particular standpoint. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, although a real occurrence brought about and the truth is only one, the point about the happening can be different in accordance to new media. Such different perspectives as to a occurrence also make distinct preference among people who choose particular media to subscribe or watch. The methods media put importance differently are represented in content or structure aspects. <TR>In case of content facet</TR>, different media reporters can stealthily imply their perspective on the articles and also they can use different headlines structurally. <TR>Thus</TR>, it is hard to say that new media are reliable.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, sometimes the new media cooperation are involved in other profit relationships such as governments or other commercial companies.</MI2><SI2>The fact that the new media also need funds to be operated cannot make them completely independent themselves. That is the reason why they sometimes distress between the sense of responsibility about dealing an article with objective views at most and inevitable profitable relationship with commercial markets like advertisements. <EX><TR>In addition</TR>, governments can overpower the new presses wielding their power because they want not to be criticized by citizens. Such many outer pressures make them confused. Such confliction sometimes make unaccurate information and results in corruption.</EX></SI2><TR>Hence</TR>, the remark that new media are fair information provider is little absurd.<BO2>

<CO>In conclusion, it is my belief that new media cannot be completely impartially about their articles. It it because their coverages are also written by human also they sometimes have the probability to collude other companies or governments. Maybe, there would not be fair media even in the more developed future because media cannot deviate from framing specific truth.

I guess the company that produces the golf ball might wanted to appeal people with showing their effort to make the ball better, but in my opinion, they must have not done any scientific study about the golf ball. If they really studied a lot about the golf ball, why can’t the ball go much longer than the ball that produced 10 years ago?

Many people seem to believe that diligence is the most important factor for a person to succeed. <TS>I basically agree with it, however I also believe that other factors must be considered to analyze people's success.</TS> They are ability and luck.</IN>

<BO1><MI1>First of all, ability is as an essential quality of success as that of hard work.</MI1> <SI1>Hard work must be based on the personal knack.

Good luck may not necessarily be needed to succeed, avoiding badluck is vital. <EX>Agriculture is an example for this. Whether being a successful year for a farmer or not is not completely depend on his ability or diligent disposition.

If we won’t take some actions about them, before long, the end of the earth must come. So, we have to exert to save disappearing resources. Although there are many resources we should protect, I think we especially try to prevent forests, in terms of their important functions as the earth’s lung and as the shelters of a number of lives on the earth.</IN>

Thanks to the functions of the forests like that, we can breathe and continue our life without difficulty. So to say, forests play a role as a huge filter of the earth.</SI1><TR>Therefore</TR>, if forests were gone, the earth would suffer from lack of air and we could not keep on our lives. <TR>Moreover</TR>, at last, it would result in the end of whole lives on the earth.</BO1>

461&People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things; other people learn by reading about things; others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.,::,"<IN>People have their own way of learning. Some people learn by doing thing; other people learn by reading about things; others learn by listening to people talk about thing.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, I can learn by reading about things anywhere and anytime.</MI1> <SI1>I can read in a car, on the bed, even in a restroom. Also I can read early in the morning or at midnight.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, students can claim their right of good education through evaluation of teachers.</MI1> <SI1>students need professor who teach faithfully. however, there was no way to communicate their expectation about good lecture without this evaluating system. in 1999, math professor in my school teach awfully. he give a lecture like speech to the wall, and he can not answer

463&Some high schools require all students to wear uniforms. Other high schools permit students to decide what to wear to school. Which of these two school policies do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN><TR>At first</TR>, people started wearing clothes to protect themselves from cold. However, this notion has weakened as they concerntrated on other functions of clothes; representation of one's status, aesthetic sense, group and etc. <TS>This has brought the idea of uniforms, to represent certain groups like soldiers, doctors, atheletes and even students. <EX>In Korea, uniform is required for almost all schools regarding high schools.</EX> I'm also bound to uniforms and I consent with the idea of wearing them.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, school uniforms have a great influence on students as a means of bringing them together.</MI1> <SI1>People should know who they are and where they belong in the society. By wearing uniforms, they are distinguished from other members of society as a respective group.</SI1><TR>Therefore</TR>, the ones in certain group can find similarity and friendliness among themselves which make it easier for them to cooperate and integrate.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, it brings equality among students.</MI2> <SI2>Not everyone is financially equal as a matter fact and uniforms can be a good solution to it. A single student would only need a pair of uniforms to wear in his school and he won't have to pay extra cash for other clothes. In fact, I think it is also fair for everyone because no one would be particulary special in terms of clothes which we are very sensible to at this age. Imagine someone wearing extravagent clothes in school, it will certainly provoke conflicts among jealous students.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Thirdly</TR>, it looks more elegant and polite for students to wear uniforms.</MI3> <SI3>There are exceptional students who would wear particular clothings that are not apt for the school; excessively violent or exposed(girls). It would give people negative prospect especially in Korea where people emphasize the politeness of students in terms of outwear; grown-ups who cling to the old school policy of obligating uniforms, regarding the neatness.</SI3></BO3> 

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I'm for the policy of making students wear uniforms. Even though I occasionally desire to wear my own clothes in school I still prefer uniforms-I can take pride of my school, feel equal, and be polite. After a year, I will eventually graduate from my high school and the uniform would be a reminder of good memories.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,Thoughtful essay,//

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, chances are very important factor to success in life.</MI1> <SI1>Without taking chances, only good planning doesn’t make sure victory. A famous baseball player in Major League in U.S.A., Chan-Ho Park in L.A Dodgers, is a typical example in success stories. He makes a lot of money, attains fame and earns respect of people.

Some people believe that advertising makes us to spend more money and other people argue that it gives us useful information about new product.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>. Advertisement gives us a lot of information about products such as prices, size and color.</MI1> <SI1>If we want to buy a new car without any information it is very difficult to choose the car tailored our requirement.

The periods when you are young adults, the people you deal with every day are mostly your family members and friends. Therefore, their effect on your life is undeniable. <TS>Of the two, however, the effect of friends on teenagers is the more considerable.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason</TR> that the friends are most influential persons in one's teenage is that he or she spend more time with friends at a time.</MI1> <SI1><EX>In Korea, middle school and high school students spend almost 15 hours with their friends in school.

<BO2><MI2><TR>The second reason</TR> is that there exists some kind of symphathies among friends.</MI2> <SI2>They pass through same agony in the same age. Thus, teenagers can share their similar problems with their friends. They can talk about sex, grades, boy/girl friend in the same level.

However, I need not do so if I live with whom I know well. In this respect, as sharing my room with a close person helps me neither to spend such efforts nor to worry about new roommate, I prefer to choose my roommate by myself.<SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, I can share common things with my roommate if I live with a close person.</MI2> <SI2>Particularly, as I should spend most of my time with her, it is so fun for me to share common hobbies or to study common fields with her. <EX>For example, because I like to play tennis, it is so enjoyable to play tennis with her.

Classmates are more influential than parents on a child's success in school.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN> It is often said that friends are more important than both of parents on being successful in school because they are able to understand better each other. <TS>However, I firmly support the idea that parents have a more significant influence on their child for two reasons : they can help their child overcome problems and perform better in school.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1> </TR>To begin with</TR>, parents enable their child to solve problem more wisely.</M1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that having lived a long time, they have already experienced many things in life, such as rebellion, having to fit in, and getting good grades in school. Thus, they have bigger views on these matters and are able to provide a more satisfactory and objective solution. <EX>For example, when I was in fifth grade, I had a huge misunderstanding that led to a fight with my best friend.</EX> Then, my friends were telling me not to speak to him until he apologized to me first. However, my mother suggested that I mend things up by taking the initiative to apologize first. <TR>Finally</TR>, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding on my part and had I not spoken to him first, we would never have cleared the issue which could have cost our friendship.</SI> This implies that parents' previous experience can be helpful for dealing with problems that are likely to occur in school.</BO1>

<BO2> <MI2><TR>In addition></TR>, by encouraging their child, parents can wield their influence on them and make them be successful in school.</MI2> <SI2>Not to mention that this encouragement has more impact on them, being told by their parents, not classmates. This is due to the fact that words of encouragements coming from parents can serve as key motivators for children to perform better and improve themselves. With such motivations, they will put in more efforts, feel more responsible for their work, and concentrate better on their tasks. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2007, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in achievements. Students in group A were praised every day for the progress they made by their parents and those in group B were scold for even little mistakes at home. The researchers showed that the former group of students spent more hours studying by 25 percent and performed higher than the latter group of students. Those in group A increased their academic performance by themselves on account of parents' encouragement. This result implies that encouragement from parents let children perform better and succeed in school.</EX> </SI2></BO2>

Some people might believe that moving from one place to another is better as they have opportunity to make new friends and culture. <TS>My view, however, is that it is better to live in one city.</TS> This is largely because living in one town gives you a sense of stability.

            <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> when you go to college, you can get an education different from high school, and it is rather complicated, professional, and fun.</MI1> <SI1>Learning further flourishes your knowledge and makes you professional towards certain subjects you select, which is obviously a great opportunity of experience when you attend college. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when my cousin was confused whether he should go to college or not, he had a desire to learn more about engineering, which required a huge amount of technical knowledge.

504&The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.,::,"<IN>It is often said that it is not necessesary to have the ability to cooperate with others. <TS><TR>However</TR> in my opinion, it is becoming more and more important to have such ability to live better for several reasons : people tend to be more open-minded than before and the world is becoming globalized.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> people are now being open-minded more than in the past, expressing one's thoughts directly.</MI1> <SI1>People in the past did not like to or refused to express one's thoughts or feelings in front of others, thought that it was either rude or shame. Compared to the people in the past, people now do not feel any difficulty to express one's thought as the society changed. People these days think that all differences between people have to be appreciated and respected. As people nowadays give lots of different ideas, the need of the ability to cooperate with others is increasing. Harmonize and unite all the possibilities into one, also satisfying all people at the same time. <EX>A survey was done by Ministry of Education in Korea to two groups. Group A with age twenties, group B with age over sixty who have lived longer than people in Group A do. The survey was about to rate the importance of some abilities needed in daily life including the ability to cooperate with others. The result was that group A responded to the cooperation question more, saying that it is necessary to have that ability because of the diversity in society.</EX> This clearly shows that the present requires more of the ability to cooperate with others than in the past.</SI1></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> as the world is becoming globalized day by day, bringing all people around the world together, it is important to accept each others' differences and cultures, cooperating.</MI2> <SI2>Many people easily and often travel overseas for many reasons and they become exposed to new environment, customs and cultures. In order to get along well with others, it is important to adjust the thinkings, opinions and ideas together without conflicts. <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> one of my friends once went abroad to study. At the place where she was staying, there were lots of other foreigners who came to study as well. Because they were all from different parts of the world they often had conflicts due to the differences in their living styles. They later become used to the environment, adjusting themselves well to be considerate, learned to cooperate with others. The friend said to me that as more and more people go abroad to study and work compared to the past, it is important to have a skill to cooperate with others.</EX></SI2></BO2>

The answer to the question can be vary greatly depending on the opinion individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus,</TR> the jury may still be out, I agree with the statement that sports activites receive the same amount of money as University libraries do.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with,</TR> sports can help students to study more effectively.</MI1> <SI1><EX>It can be evidenced by a recent report by the National Research Center of korea. According to the report, a students who enjoy sports got good grades than a students dosen’t enjoy it. Let me take my friend’s case as illustration. In my school days, my friend doesn’t study so hard, but she always got good grades. I think the reason she was able to get good grades is she enthusiastically took part in sports activities.</EX> This is attributed to the reason that human’s body all work together.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> sports activites foster students’ social skills.</MI2> <SI2>This is because sports include a wide variety of group activities such as soccer, football, and basketball that require collective effort and coopertation.<EX> For example, I could make friends playing baseball in my high school. students is able to make their friends easily playing sports games.</EX> <TR>Likewise,</TR> students can reap numerous benefits from participating in sports activities.</SI2></BO2>

506&people learn more by watching television than reading by books.,::,"<IN>Some people say that these days, TV is more intellectually beneficial. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I believe that people can glean more information by reading books than watching TV.</TS> This is because TV's ways to convey knowledge is limited, and books are likened to be food of human soul.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start,</TR> I believe that formats of the content that are broadcasted on TV is limited, thus the means to convey information is also limited.</MI1> <SI1>Only a documentary form of information gives us valuable knowledges.    
<EX><TR>For instance,</TR> although a famous TV talk show, The David Letterman Show is very interesting, but can hardly convey us valuable informations.</EX> If it gives us nothing but trivial informations, which is not very relevent to our lives, who can say it is more effective way to glean knowledge?</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Next,</TR> I think Books are food to people's soul.</MI2> <SI2>It's the books that enriches and strengthens our soul, not some TV shows. The reason why I think books are soul's food is that books contain more specific informations compared to visionary informations. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> The movie 'Extremely loud & Incredibly Close', which is cinematized version of a famous novel, Extremely Loud & Incredibly close, written by jewish writher Jonathan Safran fore, contains less information than novel version. This is because, in movies, running time is limited, which is a drawback compared to novels.</EX> <TR>And plus,</TR> books are more suited form of describing one's feelings or situations. And I think specific illustration in novels is the thing that enriches our soul, because it deepens readers mind.</SI2></BO2>
<CO><TR>In summary,</TR> I think that books are more suitable for conveying informations to readers. Because TV's ways to convey information is very limited thus leading people hard to glean valuable knowledge, and because books are more capable of giving valuable ideas that deepens our intellectual abilities by illustrating specific informations. <TR>Therefore,</TR> I disagree with the statement that people learn more by watching television than by reading books.<CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,Good essay but need to perfect grammar.

"507&Choose one of the following activities and explain why you think the activity is the best way for students to make new friends.
-Joining a sport team
-Participating in community activities
-Traveling",::,"<IN>A large number of people might argue that traveling and joining a sports team are the best way for students to make new friends. <TS>Contrary to popular belief, I believe that the best method is to participating in community activities for two reasons: broadening one's perspective and relieving stress.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> joining in a community activities allows students to broaden one's horizon and to learn to socialize with others.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that the activity exposes them to different world of lifestyles, basic customs, and cultures. Through this experience, they can learn to embrace diversity. This is especially true given the fact that modern society is becoming increasingly globalized. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> when I was in eleventh grade, there was a Malaysian girl who brought home-cooked meals, such as 'Nasillamak', which is a Malaysian traditional food, for lunch. It smelled funny and she ate with her hands without using utensils, and other students kept their distances from her who had never seen such a thing before. <TR>Nevertheless,</TR> I felt comfortable with it because when I went to Malaysia for community activities, I could experience the country's custom.</EX> This indicates that participating in community activities allow students to have a foreign friend.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore,</TR> the performances that require students to help others via involving in community activities enable students to lower their stress level, and thus having more friends.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that such activities can distract people from worries and stress. It is obvious that the activity can distract them from personal worries and concern since they have to care the people in desperate needs. <TR>Therefore,</TR> this kind work may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. <EX>According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing their academic pressure. Students in Group A who frequently engaged in community service activity have much less stress level than those in Group B who rarely engaged in the activity. The reaserchers also found out that those in Group A had more friends than those in Group B. The reason is that the people who were helped by the students wished to become a friend of the students. Even after the end of the community service, they wrote mails to each other for a long period of time. This implies that the activity serve as a safe and effective way to make friend as well as to let out stress.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In brief,</TR> although traveling and joining a sports team could be a good way to socialize and to make friends, the effectiveness of making friends by involving in community activities far-outweigh the effectiveness of making friends through prior two methods. <TR>All in all,</TR> the importance of community service activities cannot be underestimated for the sake of creating healthy relationship.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,Very good essay but still needs to perfect grammar.

     <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> speaking and writing are more efficient to study English.</MI1> <SI1>Listening and reading affect only a sense of seeing and hearing.

There is a famous poem about this in Korea. The Poem’s name is ""The Flower"". It says that it is no longer a flower after you call it a flower. The author wants to show the Flower but after he says flower, it is no longer a real Flower anymore, because it is not the exact Flower that he wanted to show to reader, it has changed. <TR>Thus,</TR> real experience can give real lessons better than  written words.</EX></SI1></BO1>

517&Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN><TS>I agree that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers in order to provide a high quality
of education.</TS> There are several advantages to be acquired by doing so.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> the evaluating system can be beneficial for students.</MI1>
<SI1>A student as a learner knows well about his or her teachers and about who is a good teacher;
moreover, the learners can perceive whether their teachers are well prepared for their classes.
<TR>Therefore,</TR> the system, which students rank a level of a teacher's educational performance, will
serve as one of the most progressive methods to be able to select out who is a good or bad educator
depending on their educating skills. This will, in return, give a great benefit to students by giving
an opportunity to be taught from a qualified teacher.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Besides the benefit for students,</TR> if schools introduce the system of allowing students to evaluate their teachers, it will be also helpful to the school in itself.</MI2>
<SI2>Schools can provide a high quality of education only if they are open to various opinions, especially
to their students who are passive receivers of education and also subjects of leading schools.
The evaluation given by students will play an important role to creating a positive school image and
educational status because there will be an increasing number of students
who hope to enter the prestigious school.</SI2></BO2>
 
<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally,</TR> allowing students to evaluate their teachers is, in fact, advantageous to teachers as well.</MI3>
<SI3>Teachers can get to know more about their good or bad points; eventually, it will give a great momentum to improve their problems or develop better educating skills.</SI3></BO3>

518&There is nothing that old people learn from the younger ones,::,"  <IN>It has been argued among many people whether younger people can teach older people and it is helpful. <TS>Although it is true that older people have experienced and learned a lot as they age, I believe that older people can have numerous benefits if they listen to the younger ones.</TS> In this essay, I am going to give two reasons supporting my idea.</IN>
           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> there have been a number of technological developments that older people had never met before.</MI1> <SI1>These days, the pace of science improvement is getting faster and faster, so it is very tough for older people to catch up with trends. They may have trouble getting used to how to use sophisticated electronic devices such as smart phones, smart pads and smart TV. <TR>However,</TR> younger people are likely to adapt these flows of changes and they behave like experts even if they are not. This shows that younger people now can utilize the newest instruments released recently and they never have difficulty keep up with today`s scientific breakthrough. <TR>Therefore</TR> it is the best way for older people to learn how to use and be used to technological development these days. <TR>Otherwise,</TR> they might lose valuable opportunities to see their loved ones` photo in any time and any place.</SI1></BO1>

           <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR>it is very effective for older people to cooperative and listen to younger people`s advices.</MI2> <SI2>It is natural that older people do great performances in their work because they have accumulated lots of experiences and overcome substantial obstacles. <TR>However,</TR> they are people, so they cannot work perfectly even if they have done the best since things have changed a lot comparing today to past. What they learned may be wrong these days and what they ignored may be considered very important in their filed. <TR>In this case,</TR> younger people can help the older ones do better consequences because they are educated by up-to-date knowledge. <TR>Also</TR> they are so passionate that they are likely to do anything if it is very critical and serious problems. Passion and knowledge that younger people possess can have great and positive influences on older people.</SI2></BO2>

           <CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> it is very important for older people to learn from the younger ones because they can help them make use a lot of devices made recently  the older ones have never learn how to use and work better by using their fervor and understanding. <TR>Therefore</TR> I certainly believe that older peole are required to learn from younger people.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,A generally organized essay with good flow and few grammar mistakes.

519&A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or to protect the environment.,::,"<IN>Some people argue that companies’ effort to support arts or environment is a waste of time, so it should not be allowed. <TS><TR>Personally,</TR> I do not agree with this view.</TS> There are many arguments to support my position, but the two main reasons are stated and explained in detail below.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> paying money to support arts should be permitted, especially for rich companies.</MI1> <SI1>This is because it is effective for relaxation and can boost people’s moods. Today, people have to live with too many tasks and too little time. <TR>As a result,</TR> their lives are run by deadlines. Because arts are a powerful stress-relieving tool such as visiting museum and watching musical, they can help people to escape from full-brown stress. This is why company should be advised to support arts.
<EX>My own personal experience can be used to prove this point. Every morning, I have to get through traffic-clogged roads to go to school. While I am at school, I also have to read through countless books. <TR>Therefore,</TR> as a way to lower my stress level, I am used to visiting art museum nearby my home right after I return home from school. Even if it is only for short time, my mind becomes relaxed, and I am no longer thinking about the demanding request at school. Indeed, during this brief period of relaxation, I am able to relieve tension and prepare myself to tackle the problems I will face at school the next day.</EX>
<TR>For this reason,</TR> companies should support art to relieve our stress.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover,</TR> supporting the environment is also beneficial because it can help people to bond with each other.</MI2> <SI2>In order to adapt to the harshness of the modern lifestyle, people have become increasingly in different to those around them. <TR>Consequently,</TR> the traditional notion of friendship has weakened and family ties have loosened. <TR>However,</TR> people can restore the value of friendship and family life by developing the environment. This is because people can get together with their friends and family in clean and nice parks thanks to the company’s effort to support the environment.</SI2></BO2>
<EX>A recent study, which is done by Stanford Univ., found that having a good park near home provide useful opportunities for people who are struggling to connect with their families and peers.</EX><TR>Basically,</TR> parks are good places to meet people and to talk with people, so people who have nice park near home can freely express their views in parks even if the topic is arguable. <TR>Therefore</TR> it is needed that company gives as much as money to public or government to build more parks.
 
<CO><TR>Therefore,</TR> in spite of the potential disadvantages of supporting arts and the environment, this activity is not waste of money in modern society, <TR>Instead,</TR> it offers people huge advantages, which are likely to increase over time.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,2,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"A very coherent and well written essay.

520&It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.,::,"<IN>The question of whether city life is better or country life is better has been the subject of many debates and conversations. Since the Industrial Revolution, more and more people to started to flock to cities for various reasons. And with it came a lot of problems as well as advantages. <TS>While some say county life serves us better,in my opinion, living in a big city still outweighs country life in many areas.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with,</TR> better education can be expected in cities due to the fact that there are more of schools competing each other to attract more students.</MI1> <SI1>More competition means that they are collectively attempt to be ahead of others in curricula,cost,quality of staff members,and even amenities,  thus ultimate beneficiary would be students. <TR>Not only that,</TR> students can enjoy more variety of subjects of their interest as well. Students might have their own field of interest; for some, language learning is considered more important , while others would be more inclined to high-tech related areas. And it is imperative for students to have appropriate providers in order to have necessary education. <TR>However,</TR> limited numbers of school available in country can prevent us from having that. <TR>Thus,</TR> students can fall into being incompetent compared to those in cities.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> city life can have benefit of more entertaining choices.</MI2> <SI2>More population in city life might stimulate entertaining-related sectors such as library,arcade,theaters,museum,and so forth. This is highly significant for one's quality of life. We live in a society with high competition and subsequent stresses, and without having proper means to control that, we might consider our lives to be miserable. 
And it can be assumed that everyone would have different definition of entertainment; some might find going to a museum very pleasing whereas others would watch a movie to get rid of stress. <TR>Therefore,</TR> restricted choices of those would leave some without any choice.</SI2></BO2> 

<BO3><MI3><TR>Lastly,</TR> we can also build up social skill provided by being exposed to various kinds of people in cities.</MI3> 
<SI3>In cities, there are not only people residing there but also those from other towns,cities,and even countries. Even though county might have distinction in people's characteristics, they have tendency of putting value on conformity to one way of acting,dressing,speaking, and more. This compartmentized view makes it possible for one to have narrowed social skill, and it is apparent that there are myriad kinds of people in our society and it's indispensable to recognize how to deal with them.</SI3></BO3>

Teachers should assign homework every day.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> getting a high degree of stress coming from immense homework forbid the students to live a stress-free life.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that having homework everyday can stress the students out by making them worry about how to finish them after class everyday. <TR>Moreover,</TR> stress is one of the main factors of disease through weakening the immune system. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2009, a test on mice showed that life span was shortened when they regularly underwent series of electric shocks.

This implies that the high stress levels arising from assigned homework everyday can negatively affect the students' health condition by malfunctioning the immune system.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> teachers do not need to give their students assignments everyday.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that even if intermittent homework can be helpful for their grades in school, such exhausting one is only detriment to students' motivation to study hard.

522&Television advertising directed toward children under the age of five should not be allowed.,::,"<IN><TS>I agree with the idea saying that television advertising directed toward children under the age of five should not be allowed because of several reasons : children under the age of five are not able to make right decision and can harm the children's health.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> children under the age of five are not mature enough to make right decision for themselves.</MI1> <SI1>They cannot clarify what will be good for them or not. If they are told that a certain product is good, they will just accept it, thinking that they had made a wise decision. They are in learning process, therefore easily affected by things around them. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> there was an experiment conducted by Seoul National University, to check whether young children at the age of four to five can make a rational decision. There was a book in foreign language and children were told that the book contains a good quality of story therefore it is good. Although the explanation about the book was not enough, no one asked futher questions about it. After the lecturer got out of the room, leaving the book and children alone, the researchers found out that all children wanted the book for themselves although they do not exactly know what that was. This shows that if the television advertising directs toward children, telling that the product is good, children will just want to have those products without any reasons.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> television advertising can harm the children's health.</MI2> <SI2>If the children cannot get things that they want, they will be stressed. This can harm children's mental health. Children are still young to control their emotions rationally. <TR>Therefore</TR> it would be difficult for them to manage the stress got by their dissatisfaction that they could not get all things they want. Many parents want their children to have things that they want, but it is hard for the parents to get all things because of their finance and for their  own children as they can be rude if they get all things that they want at once, not able to appreciate it. <EX>A survey was done by Ministry of Education in Korea.

"530&Do you agree or disagree with following statement? About environmental issues, individual people can do nothing about it because it is too complicated.",::,"<IN>A large number of people might argue that individual people can solve environmental issues despite of its complexity. <TS><TR>Contrary to popular belief,</TR> I believe that individuals cannot deal with environmental issues for following reasons: economic loss, and intense stress that derived from attempt to resolve them.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> individuals' tries to recover environment hinder people from living happy life.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that money that originated from depleting natural resources tends to represent their power in society by showing their ability to attain whatever they want ranging from fancy cars to even trust in relationship. <TR>To explain</TR>, in modern society, economy developed by consuming natural assets such as woods and coal. The activities that utilize such materials certainly damage environment. <TR>Hence,</TR> it can be deemed that deeds to reconstruct environment by hampering such activities can negatively affect people in terms of finance. <TR>Therefore,</TR> individuals attempt to heal damaged environment will be avoided by majority of people. This is especially true given the fact that modern society runs on materialism. <EX>According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea in 2010, there was a huge difference between two groups of employees in happy index. Employees in Group A owned a house and those in Group B rented a house. The researchers found that the level of happiness of Group A was much higher than that of Group B. <TR>Moreover</TR>, more than 60 percent of the workers in Group B underwent a severe depression. They constantly worry about paying rent in order to maintain a roof over their head. This indicates that money or economic benefit that came from anti-eco-friendly acts makes life easier and more comfortable.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> working on environmental issues in individual level arise stress to many people.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that such works can bring worries and stress to them. It is obvious that involving such activities can stress people out since most of modern society is closely related to factors that destroy environment. <TR>To be specific,</TR> general products that people use such as computers, fancy clothes, and microwave are the factors that harm environment. These products require natural resources such as soil and rare gem to be produced. <TR>Therefore,</TR> this complex projects to deal with environmental issues may actually serve as a stress arousal source.<EX> According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, there was a significant difference between two groups of students in managing their academic pressure. Students in Group A who rarely engaged in eco-friendly performances were more satisfied with their school lives than those in Group B who frequently joined to such activities.<TR>On the other hand,</TR> those in Group B were involved in dangerous activities such as smoking, drinking, and stealing to cope with their stress. This implies that the eco-friendly works can become a common pain for individuals.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In brief,</TR> although many people urge that environmental issues can be alleviated by each person, such activities will be ignored by vast majority of people for the reasons that I have mentioned above. <TR>All in all,</TR> the importance of overlooking environmental problems cannot be underestimated for the sake of society.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,"Organized with a clearly stated thesis.

531&It is more advantageous for children to grow up in rural areas than in big cities.,::," <IN>It has been argued among some people whether children can get more benefits when they are raised in rural than when they spend their childhood in big cities. <TS>Although it is true that growing up in urban enable children to experience a lot of developed and convenient things, I believe that children can grow as a better person if they are raised in rural area. In this essay, I am going to provide two examples supporting my idea.</TS></IN>

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> the countryside can encourage children to have a lot of experience that they can touch and interact with nature, which make them keep healthy.</MI1> <SI1>Children who stay in the city have difficulty trekking, swimming and hiking. It is pretty hard for them feel nature in the first hand, even if great environment is necessary for them to develop their health. <TR>On the contrary,</TR> children who live in rural region are surrounded by many beautiful natures. They can experience a lot for things related to environment as a result they have more opportunity to have physically healthy attributes. <EX>According to recent survey by BBC, children who grow up in the countryside achieve greater performance in the physical activities than ones who live in city.</EX></SI1></BO1>
           <BO2><MI2><TR>On the top of that,</TR> city is relatively dangerous, <TR>however</TR> the countryside is very safe for any crime or accidents, so children can spend their childhood very safely.</MI2> <SI2><EX>There have been a number of criminal that focus on children recently. Children now are exposed to very dangerous things such as very fast car on the road or drunken men who are likely do anything that we cannot expect in city. <TR>In contrast,</TR> the countryside provides them with such a safe environment that cannot be harmful to them. People who live in rural area are so nice and kind that they are not threaten children.</EX> <TR>And also</TR> there is a little traffic on the road and there is no reason to hurry in that kind of rural area. So the possibility that children can get accidents in the countryside is much lower than one in the city.</SI2></BO2>

           <CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> the countryside enables children to grow up in the safe and healthy surroundings and it really helpful for them to live and make their own world. <TR>Therefore</TR> I certainly believe that it is more beneficial for children to grow up in the countryside</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,Good essay and good use of examples.

532&Cooperation is more important in today's society than the past.,::,"<IN>In today's complicated society, it is believed that there are many things to do which requires teamwork like farming in the past. Some people advocate that a current person should invest almost entire time to develop his or her own competence to achieve something rather than cooperation. <TR>However,</TR> I disagree with this view. <TS>I firmly believe that the ability to cooperate with others become much more important than the past time.</TS> It is because it is hard for one person to treat whole things and today's society has stretched works in the world which require more and more understanding about other cultures.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> achieving something successfully by oneself become difficult compared to the past.</MI1> <SI1>As technology has developed, a lot of fields are concretely sophisticated. That is, people have hard time finding out other fields unrelated to their jobs. <TR>In addition,</TR> today's times put importance on fusion among areas like a compound of art and cell-phone. Many consumers do not buy a new cell-phone model just because its design is appealing or it has merely original functions. They purchase when both two factors fits with their preference. It shows well the consumer's needs also become complicated and diverse. If a designer and an engineer strive for inventing a new model together, the procedure would be more efficient as their diverse knowledge would be reflected on it. That is, it can also a increase the probability of making a breakthrough. <TR>As a result,</TR> nowadays competent designers and engineers collaborate together to satiate requirements from people in leading companies. In addition, it is common that universities promote team projects for their students to be able to cope with works which need a coordination among people in different realms in their future jobs. <TR>Accordingly,</TR> cooperation can allow people to accomplish bigger success.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover,</TR> the chance to work with people from other countries has been increasing.</MI2> <SI2>It is because many globalized companies has sprang up around the world. It means that they require employees who can cooperate with foreigners. The cooperation especially includes requisite such as the understanding about other cultures and proficiency of English. If a group composed of only Koreans works in China, they couldn't get any success. When they employ the native people in China, they can achieve a goal of their enterprise. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> a famous international pizza company made success through naturalization. The success required natural employees' help who know well what taste and savor are preferred by residents in a specific country.</EX> <TR>Thus,</TR> it shows that when people start to business in other countries, they need to employ and cooperate with native people.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> it is my belief that cooperation is more indispensible factor in current society rather than the past. <EX>It is heard in a news article that many people try to begin their own company, about 5% companies survive in markets after 10 years.</EX> If they put effort to cooperate with diverse people, the probability to succeed would be rise.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,Generally coherent and organized.

533&People should spend their money on traveling rather than saving for the future,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether people should spend their money on traveling rather than saving for the future. Some people believe that people need to save for the future as they can do diverse things in the future. <TS>My view, <TR>however,</TR> is that people should spend their money going to another countries.</TS> There is largely because people have the opportunity to learn a sense of responsibility and independence. <TR>Moreover,</TR> they can make so many diverse people of many backgrounds.</IN>

By doing so, they decide their schedule on their own. <EX><EX><TR>For example,</TR> I was vacation on last year in Hong-Kong. When airplane landed on there, it was 11pm. Because I was alone, I couldn’t provide any help. I was concerned about this situation and felt anxiety. But I asked foreign people to give some advice to recommend living for days.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> As I mentioned above, by helping their children to prepare for an adult life by helping them to do a part-time job.</MI1> <SI1>This can enable those children to realize the meaning of getting job in society. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> by working and earning money, they can realize how hard earning money is.

 <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> information-inspecting method is not perfectly developed and applicable to all the website creating numerous fishy articles in nation.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that inspecting every website is not possible for now, considering today's IT level.

     <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> people have thier own idea, so it is hard to unite in one idea.</MI1> <SI1>If there are a lot of people in a group, there would be many ideas and opinions. <TR>Therefore,</TR> it is almost impossible for them to make their opinions into one.

544&It is more important for a teacher to help students gain self-confidence than to provide them with specific information.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> self-confidense given by teachers enables students to increase their academic performance by themselves.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that such self-esteem can serve as one of the key motivators for students to perform better and improve themselves. With such motivations, they will put in more efforts, concentrate better on tasks, and feel more responsible for their work. <EX>According to a study conducted by Hanyang University of Korea in 2009, there existed a huge difference between two groups of students in achievements. Through lectures, students in group A were able to get a help to elevate their confidence and those in group B were given detailed information about major subjects. The researchers showed that the students in group A spent more hours studying by 25 percent and performed higher than those in group B. <TR>In particular,</TR> they followed instuctions, submitted assignments on time, and participated actively in class discussion. This implies that self-esteem raised by their teachers has a direct correlation with the amount of efforts and energy into studying, resulting in an enhanced performance.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> the high level of confidence taught by teachers allows students to be hired by honorable companies.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that as modern society is becoming increasingly competitive, today's job markets require job candidates with self-confidense. <EX>According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2007, the self-confidence of the applicants was the most important qualification for recruiting, taking up more than 65 percent of the final calls.

Everyone might have their preference and hatred, and some only apt to do things that they like only while others would put more emphasis on fulfilling responsibility regardless. <TS>Even if some say it's the best to do what you like exclusively, I disagree and following are my reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> from the perspective of wholeness, our society is composed of every distinctive individuals making wholeness as one piece.

<SI1>Teachers might have to be diligent enough to provide the students with best learning experience, parents are to support their kids by working hard,students,doctors,firefighter and police would have to accommodate what they have in their hands to the best they can.

Only consequences that will be left for us are poorly prepared education for the kids,patients who do not receive best treatment and children with no money to go to school.
<TR>Thus,</TR> it is my utter opinion that there are always thing we still have to do not just for ourselves but everyone involved in our family,society,and to a larger extent our country.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> with the advent and spread of renewable energy sourses such as wind and solar energy, people will not confront a problem in which they worry about the limited amount of fossil fuels.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that we knowing through it's name, the renewable energy is a almost perpetual and everlasting ones compared to the fossil fules. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2009, the amount of fossil fues is so restrictive and limited that people only can use the fossil fuels for up-coming 50 years.

 <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> considering the claim that utilizing renewable energy sourses will contribute to overcoming today's energy problems in terms of cost-effectiveness and environment, we end up replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources in the future.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that when governments and individuals increase the use of renewable energy sources such as solar energy, people can depend less on traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels which are running out, expensive. and even severely detrimental to the environment. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was in fifth grade, my father decided to install a solar energy heater at our house.

In my town, the story goes same.<TS>In this essay, I would like to enumerate some of advantages and drawbacks of my town.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly,</TR> when a person comes to my town, he would notice right away how clean,yet convenient it is.</MI1>
<SI1>My town is situated in a rather rural area with a lot tree turning colors according to seasons,however, it
only takes 40 minutes to get to the metropolitan city called Seoul. I once used to live in a far remote countryside,in which it would take me at least 30 minutes to get to any place regardless of its kind. 
This inconvenience accumulated to the point where I started to hate every aspect of that place, if even there were surely many advantages. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> living in a metropolitan city would not be very pleasing from certain perspective:ever-lasting traffic jam,crowded area with people packed trying to bustle each other,high cost of living,busy life style are just a few of representation of city life. Ideally, my town offers the convenience of city life supplemented by serenity,coziness,and environmentally friendly of countryside.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Conversely,</TR> education and relative lack of job opportunity can be shortcomings of my town.</MI2> <SI2>My town is newly established town, thus every aspects of my town are of less experience. And this sometimes makes frustration and less desirable place to live for a long time. <EX>Education,for example, can only see the enhancement after a number of mistakes and correction,competition and advancement,experience over experience.</EX> However, because many families are farming-related backgrounds, they have tendency to put less emphasis on education than city might be. Moreover, less number of schools in my  town doesn't make it necessary to compete with one another;leading to rather laid-back in terms of developing new teaching methods and curriculum. Therefore, when put into strict comparison with those of city, it leaves a lot to be desired, specially for those who value highly of their child's education.</SI2></BO2>

548&Some people prefer to eat at food stands or restaurants. Other people prefer to prepare and eat food at home. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer,::,"<IN>One of the trends brought about by 21 century is eating out, and it's a common dilemma among many what we choose to eat every night. Moreover, a lot of discussions have been made as to whether eating at home is better or eating out is more beneficial. <TS>While many argue in favor of eating at home on the many grounds such as cost effectiveness, I firmly believe that eating out is more suitable for today's life for many including myself.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly,</TR> contrary to what many believe, eating out can actually save us a lot more money than eating at home.</MI1> <SI1>Reason behind this is that today's restaurants are very different from previous times in the way  they purchase ingredients needed to make food. Before, restaurants used to be owned rather in a small scale thus the way they bought ingredients was not so different from just regular home, which they go to a market and shop around to pick what seemingly is the best with a bit of negotiation on the price. <TR>However,</TR> newly developed network system of ingredient purchase for restaurants has been so advanced and well established that as long as they consume in bulk amount, they can purchase at a much cheaper rat ,which is directly translated in to their price.<TR>Not only that,</TR> in case we eat at home, the needed items for whatever the food we try to make have to be bought in a package most of the time. This creates a lot of waste of food because we usually end up throwing them away after them being in the fridge for a month or so. <TR>Therefore,</TR> in the long run, eating out can be much cost effectively smarter way of dining.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover,</TR> It is also more practical way of eating as well.</MI2> <SI2>We are living in a society where it puts a lot of demand on us for just about every aspect. we are swamped with work load and full of responsibility.
Time has been made valuable that can exceed any other side of our lives. Getting information,shopping,reading books,spending time with our families,recreation,and,most importantly work are just few things we have to do on a regular basis. <TR>Therefore,</TR> the one that knows how to spend time wisely might have better chance of succeeding in society. The problem with eating out is that it takes too much of our precious time away. Not only it takes more time to shop and cook the food but also cleaning up would take equally same amount of our important time. If we spend those time on something much more practical like searching on-line for stock market, reading newspapers and so forth, we are not only smart on spending the time wisely, but also our potential prospect would much more be bright due to better preparedness and knowledge gained from those efforts.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all,</TR> while eating out has also negative side such as nutritional balance of the food and tendency to eat a lot on account of greater proportion served at restaurants, in my opinion, the advantage given by eating out is so great we just can not refuse that option these days.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,Well organized idea.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> people having a mind to remain optimistic are able to make themselves stronger because they have a great power to survive hard situation.</MI1> <SI1>In other words, it is difficult for people who pursuit only success to solve their problems when they meet rough situation. <EX>I have experienced this on many occasions but the most notable example was when I was a university student. I was able to get high grades because I tried to keep optimistic mind when I fail a test.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> success is not the most important but many people pursuit success.</MI2> <SI2>This is largely due to the fact that most people in our society try to succeed in every field.

A teacher's ability to relate well to students is more important than his or her ability to impart knowledge.,::,"<IN>It is often said that teachers' first priority is to communicate with students well and understand them from their view point. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I firmly believe that the teachers must concentrate on instructing their students effectively rather than getting along with them because of two reasons : to let them be successful in life and to increase their performance in class.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> the teachers' capability to teach the students enables them to be successful in life.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that thought by a teacher who has a efficient teaching skill, students get to be able to study in a more effective way. By doing so, they can get good grades in school and end up going into one of the famous universities in nation. <TR>Moreover,</TR> as modern society is becoming increasingly competitive, today's job market requires job candidate with a degree from noted universities. <EX>According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2008, the degree coming from honorable universities was the most important component in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final calls. The interviewers significantly considered what university the applicants graduated.</EX> This implies that the teacher's ability to instruct students in a better way has a direct correlation with the students' success in the future.</SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> being instructed by a teacher who is competent in teaching, the students will increse their academic performance by themselves.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that the teachers' competence for teaching is one of the key motivators for students to perform higher and improve themselves. <EX>According to a study conducted by University of California at Los angeles of the United States in 2010, there existed a huge difference bewteen two groups of students in achievement. Students in group A were thought by a teacher who is good at imparting his knowledge to students and those in group B were thought by an uninitiated instructor. The researchers showed that the former group spent more hours studying by 25 percent and performed higher than the latter group. In particular, the students in group A followed instructions, submitted assignments on time, and participated in class discussion. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> those in group B dozed off in class and lacked focus in class materials. This implies that the higher teachers' ability to teach students, the more the student pour in their study.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
 <CO><TR>In brief,</TR> instructors' ability to give knowledge to students is more important than maintaining a stable relationship with the students by relating well to them. <TR>All in all,</TR> teachers having a capacity to give a impressive lecture, students will get better grades and be successful in the future through increasing their academic performance.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,Well organized ideas.

554&Teachers should retrain every five years to avoid being behind the times.,::,"   <IN>Lately, whether teachers should retrain or not has been a controversy among people. <TS>In my opinion, I believe that reeducation for teachers give advantages to them and should be necessary, since instructors can obtain the latest information on the subject and renew their minds as a teacher.</TS></IN>
 
             <BO1><MI1><TR>For starters,</TR> educational instructors can replace the out-dated information with the newest information.</MI1> <SI1>When they are at school, they barely have access to the up-to-date information related to the field since they are busy with school related tasks and lectures. <TR>However,</TR> when they are intentionally provided with the opportunity to take a lecture on retraining, they would be able to get those contents.<TR>Moreover,</TR> since teachers of the same major gather up in one place, they can discuss their expertised field, exchanging opinions on it and broaden their views.</SI1></BO1>
 
             <BO2><MI2><TR>Next,</TR> teachers can reform their minds as educational offerers.</MI2> <SI2>After five years becoming instructors, they can forget about the mind that they had when they were new such as resolutions as teachers and this can be rectified by reeducation. During the retraining lecture, not only it provides them with the newest content but also gives education on humanity. They offer teachers how to deal with children and what it is to become a teacher. By attending this lecture, instructors can look back at the times when they desired to become a teacher and help them set their minds.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO>Though some people dispute that being a retrainee for teachers is useless and time-consuming, the fact that they can update the information on their teaching field and set up their hearts as instructors cannot be ignored. <TR>In conclusion,</TR> I consent to the idea that educational instructors to attend lectures for retrainable purpose is essential.</CO>      ",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,Well organized essay.

At 5’11,” Jordan was deemed too short by his coach and failed to make the cut for the varsity basketball team. Undeterred by failure, Jordan practiced relentlessly and woke up at 5 a.m. every morning to refine his moves and shoot the ball around with his father.

560&The second reading of a book is more interesting than the first reading.,::,"  <IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not the second reading of a book is more interesting than the first reading. The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus,</TR> the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that the first reading of a book and reading various books is more interesting and advantageous.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <TR>First,</TR> it allows one to broaden view of life. <TR>Second,</TR> the second reading of a book is not good for one’s health.</IN>

 

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> the first reading of a book and reading various books enables one to widen view of life.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that reading a lot of books at first time will expose one to different worlds of life styles, basic customs, and cultures from various contexts of books, and he or she can be familiarized with and embrace other cultures and people. Thus, one can make different friends with different backgrounds, which helps one to reduce prejudice and be open-minded toward strangers. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> there had been a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if reading books just first time is good for readers. Of all, 78.1 percent of them stated that it is effective for them because they can read lots of books without the second reading and gain various experience indirectly, leading to broaden their perspectives. For this reason, the Seoul National University in Korea recommends their students to read books first time and various books.</EX><TR>Therefore,</TR> the first reading is more interesting than the second reading of a book as it helps readers to widen view of their life.</SI1></BO1>

 

           <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> the second reading of a book is detrimental to one’s health.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that readers become stressed out when trying to understand the contents of books, and stress is one of the main factors of diseases through weakening the immune system. <TR>Thus,</TR> readers are likely to be weaker when dealing with the challenges. <EX>According to an article, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor claimed: “People do not need to read books at several times in order to understand the contents of books. This is because as they have to try to understand the whole meaning of connection of sentences, words, and paragraphs in books in order to understand entire contents of books, it is likely that readers become stressed out. <TR>However,</TR> reading books is for being happy, obtaining information, and making one’s mental health good. For this reason, people have to avoid reading books at several times.” <TR>Thus,</TR> the second reading of a book is not effective for people since they easily become stressed out when dealing with difficulties.</EX></SI2></BO2>

On the other hand, I saw a lot of people who achieved the goal whose family is also happy and encouraging. <TS>Therefore, I agree with the statement that speding time with family is more important, and I suppot my opinion for two reasons.</TS> First, since family members tend to care each other, it improves the ability of working. Plus, spending time with family, especially with their children makes a child grow healthier.</IN>
 
     <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> family members used to encourage each other, and this makes themselves work more better.</MI1> <SI1>The relationship between the work and the home is different. The relationship in the work is more or less official and cool-blooded. People in the work only work for their success and they compete with each other. <TR>Moreover,</TR> this relationship often hurts others heart. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> the relationship in the home is coorperative and encouraging. One family member cures and cares for other member in the family who got hurt from his or her work. <TR>As a result,</TR> this enhance one's ability to work better in the job. <EX>One statistic has shown that people who spend more time with their family were promoted to high rank approxmately about 35% more. <TR>However,</TR> people who do not have little possibility to be promoted having posibility of 5%. This report shows how important making good realtionship with family is.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
     <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> spending time with family help their children grow healthier.</MI2> <SI2>These days, there are tons of children who do not spend their time with their parents, because their both parents are too busy working to care for them. Their parents have no choice but to send them to the children care center. But this brings about serious problems to children. <EX>I have read a newspaper article which states that children whose parents spend most of their time with them are more likely to grow healthier in terms of mental statement. But others who do not are often at odds with their friedns and family, and even show violent tendency in a school.</EX> <TR>Thus,</TR> spending time with family - especially children - is important.</SI2></BO2>
 
     <CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> spending time with family is beneficial in two ways. <TR>First,</TR> family help each other improve the ability of work, because they encourage and care for each one's heart. <TR>Second,</TR> spending time with family, especially children is important for children's growth.

<SI1>Of course, movies and television offer lots of information, yet I believe that is not much useful and well-organized than books.

<EX><TR>In addition,</TR> on research I read about before, the media drops children’s concentration.

Some people believe that a person can conduct tasks successively with his or her own ability. <TS>My view, <TR>however,</TR> is that it is important for people to listen to advice offered by someone else.</TS> This is largely because people can learn many sources needed for group work by communicating with whom have diverse experiences. <TR>Furthermore,</TR> rejecting team members’ suggestion can be a main cause of conflict among the team.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> people can improve ability doing their tasks by accepting the criticism from others.</MI1> <SI1>It is no secret that we can get so many valuable advices by asking or accepting group members’ advice. This is because there would be so many people who have more developed skills at their field. <EX>For example, when I was freshman, I had to perform a group project in a major class with seniors and they were more knowledgeable about my major. <TR>Hence</TR> when I had trouble with my work, I usually asked them to help me, so I finally finished my part more easily.

Many people likes spending their money on long-lasting things such as jewelry despite the price of those things. <TS><TR>However,</TR> feeling a low degree of pleasure more frequently has a positive effect on people's lives in several ways.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> spending money on something that last for a short time enables people to live a happy life.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that through spendning money on such things, people can feel more pleasure, satisfying themselves. Moreover, those satisfactory lives is one of the main factors in people's lives to make them feel they are living a happy life. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2009, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in happiness index. Students in group A were allowed to spend their money freely anytime they want to. Those in group B were required to spend money on very expensive things that they really want to purchase. The researchers showed that the level of happiness in group A was much higher than that of group B. Moreover, more than 30 percent of the students in group B underwent mild depression. They had to worry about to save money in order to buy long-lasting but expensive things and sometimes they cannot spend their money for this reason.

The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. <TS>Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that employing cell phones in transportation is useful.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <TR>First,</TR> it helps one to relieve stress. <TR>Second,</TR> it improves work efficiency.</IN>

 

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> using mobile phones when people use public transportation can significantly reduce their stress level.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that when people have problems about loud noise from others, playing game by cell phones distract them from worries and stress. This simple and quick escape from stress may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. <EX>For example, there had been a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if using mobile phones in subway is effective. Of all, 78.1 percent of them stated that it is advantageous for them to deal with stress. When they use public transportation, they are usually irritated by loud noise from others. <TR>However,</TR> they can effectively handle their stress by playing game, surfing the Internet, and chatting with their friends by their mobile phones.</EX> For this reason, utilizing cell phones in transportation is advantageous for people as they can relieve their stress.</SI1></BO1>

 

                             <CO><TR>In addition,</TR> using cellphones in public transportation enhances work efficiency. This is due to the fact that most of businesspeople often spend time out of their offices. Thus, employing their cell phones in public places helps them to get in touch with their co-workers, search useful information, and communicating with expertise whenever they need. <EX>According to an article, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor at Harvard University in America claimed: “using mobile phones is useful for modern businesspeople to improve work efficiency. This is because as our society is becoming more and more competitive and fast-changing, they have to meet diverse expertise, visit other offices, and meet their clients individually, leading to use public transportation to meet other people and visit other offices.</EX> For this reason, using mobile phones is helpful for them to work in moving.”</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> teachers are professional.</MI1> <SI1>And the title of professional isn't acquired over night. They must have put in a lot of hours and sweat before they reached at the point where they can educate somebody.

The  accumulation of knowledge on the subject of their major,teaching methods,and ability of engaging students in the classroom conducts can provide students with not only efficiency in their learning but also practicality as well.

In case students students study by themselves, all the experience and knowledge of teachers, which can save a lot time of students and offer guideline resulting from experience, pretty much have to be dealt with by oneself. Imagine how unpractical and time-consuming that will be.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> by having interaction with teachers, students can have such a sense of role model.</MI2> <SI2>Teachers are not only experienced in teaching and education but also in life in general as well.

And there's always a room that can't be fulfilled by parents. <TR>Thus,</TR> combination of roles of both parents and teacher in that sense can be the best setting one can ever have.</SI2></BO2>

They don’t care whether the advertisements contain inappropriate materials for children. Children need to be away from these harmful materials until they’re old enough to sift them out.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2>These days, many children get addicted to watching TV.</MI2> <SI2>It’s a big problem because children don’t want to do what they’re supposed to do like reading books, playing outside with their friends. TV advertisements could add fuel to this bad situation. TV advertising usually contains highly addictive materials like interesting songs, dynamic pictures. That’s because Advertisers should impress customers within a few minutes of advertising. Children would get addicted to these materials easily, which means they would eventually spend plenty of time watching TV, which would increase the chances of the children getting addicted to watching TV.</SI2></BO2>

In those cases, we should get money but in high costs if we do not have money to solve those problems. We can borrow money from a bank at a high interest rate or visit serveral friends to get money.

     <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> students can do their part-time job in the stable circumstance.</MI1> <SI1>Usually, the workplaces require students to work for a long time. <TR>Therefore,</TR> they prefer students who graduated from their college or take their semesters off. <TR>As a result,</TR> students who are attending a college have hard time getting a part-time job. They only can work in the vacation period. If students get short-term vacations, they will never get part-time job anymore, even in their vacations. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> a friend of mine could not get any part-time job during the semester, because the owner of the business did not want a student who could not work for a long time.

587&Does grade encourage students to study?,::,"<IN>The question of whether or not grade system is beneficial for students has been debated for decades without definitive conclusion. Some may assert that grade system is indispensable for stimulation purpose, while others believe that there might be better alternatives to that. <TS>While both have their points made, in my opinion, grading system still bears far more advantages than otherwise.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with,</TR> grading system will put students in constant competitive environment, which, I believe, is crucial in upgrading their marks.</MI1> <SI1>Society is composed of numerous and continuous competition, in which, whether we like or not, we are left with no other choice but to comply with. People compete for better occupation, promotion, better house, better education for their sons and daughters, and even better recreational activities. And it can be easily concluded that these all sorts of competition are the core reasons of running the society, and to a larger extent, countries and even the world. Because it is humans' nature to become better than others in any means possible, people might work and upscale their weapons to the fullest capacity. Same logic goes for the school and the grade. Without this competing environment, students would start taking his job, in this case student, lightly thus they would eventually become incompetent one at the end of the day.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Add to that,</TR> teachers might have better understanding of where their students are positioned.</MI2> <SI2>Why this is important? When teachers have better ideas as to where their students are, they might come up with better solutions to their problem. Usually, teachers have to deal with from 30 to 50 students at a time, if it were small classroom that she/he manages and cares, then it can be said possible to make the best judgement and advice for the students just by having interaction and conversation with them. However, a lot of cases, it's not that simple. With students that much, I believe, one most effective method one can utilize is by having grade system, which will provide the teachers with precise ideas on their students marks. Based on that understanding, teachers can provide the best mentoring to the students, which is going to be the helpful tool for students to torch their path.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> motivating children to study by giving money cannot be long last.</MI1> <SI1>In general, most parents come up with an idea to monetary rewards to engage their children to study hard.

At first, this suggestion looked work well because he studied very hard and got a better grade.

"594&When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success? Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.",::,"<IN>Today, many people are living, wanting to know how to succeed in their lives, make much money, or get a good job. No one knows the answer, but we are always pursuing and making an effort to live better life than before. In this sense, people cannot help working hard to succeed in their places. <TR>However,</TR> there are some debates about ‘factors’ for successful life. <TS>I think those who only work hard in their working places cannot achieve their great success for sure.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> not only is success pursued by hard working but also by other factors.</MI1> <SI1>If success can be achieved only by the passion in their job or fields where people feel interests, few people regret about their passed time. <EX>Let me introduce my experience that happened in my university laboratory. In my lab, there was a friend who worked with me for a project, relevant to graduation. He was a leader in my team, having passion about his job, but did not entirely care about other members in the group. The project has been continued for seven months, but all he did was just to command to other member without any compassion. In the end of the project, we got the best praise about the project, but all members, except the leader, flew away from the lab. As we can see in my experience, the success cannot be made only of hard working. If we ignored other factors, such as relationship with others, we would not achieve something that we expect.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> chances come with the name of “Luck.”</MI2> <SI2>We do not know the time when the chance come, which sometimes entirely changes our life. Some renowned people who succeeded in their fields, such as business, engineering, or economy, says that grabbing the best chance is the most important factor to succeed in their life. However, most of the chances are not related to hard working. Even though a person spent time working hard, he would unintentionally leave the chance passing by him. Indeed, I think the chance camouflages with the name of “Luck.” Luck can be interpreted as the timing, such as the generation or era when a person has been born, and related to location, where a person is living. With concerns to success, most people who achieved their goals meet the needs the generation required. Therefore, those who achieved their goals would not remain in honorable history unless they were born in the very location, and the very generation.</SI2></BO2>

595&Sometimes it is difficult to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying in the media.,::,"<IN><TR>Today</TR>, people are mainly influenced by the media such as TV, radio, and the Internet when they live their lives. We cannot help getting information from these kinds of mass media. <TS><TR>However</TR>, we should warn ourselves from the information originating from the media because the truth could be hidden in many cases. <TR>Therefore</TR>, we should have eyes to discern whether the information from the media is true or not. There are some reasons why it is difficult to clarify the truth.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the media, including TV and even the Internet, can be faked if the information is highly related to political or sensitive issue in a society.</MI1> <SI1>In some cases of politicians, some of them sometimes commit extramarital affairs, which are considered highly immoral behaviors by the people. <TR>However</TR>, they can obscure this kind of facts by giving some bribe to those who have ability to change the result from the scandals.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, it can be difficult to determine who tell the truth in the media because many factors relevant to the truth are complicated, like a chain.</MI2> <TR>Of course</TR>, all information, regardless of the themes of news, has the origin that comes from a person who tell the truth. <TR>However</TR>, as if we have difficulties to solve a complex math problem, in the media there can be a complex relationship. With routes where the information is transported entangled, the truth eventually goes into mystery, and even a person who tell the truth would be evaporated. Most people who encounter the media see the final result, with the other unnecessary information ignored, which interferes us not to look on the truth but merely on the result.</BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, it is hard to find who tell the truth in the media if some information needs to be kept confidential, especially in the case of politician-related matter, or it is so complicated that people cannot clarify the origin of who tell the truth. <TR>Therefore</TR>, we need to be careful when believing information from the media.</CO> ",::,2,::,2,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,2,::,3,::,0,::,"The thesis statement is very unclear, but there are good main ideas in each paragraph.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, people can receive information that takes place all over the world and respond to it immediately.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>As an example</TR>, there was an incident of murder in Korea. The police had trouble finding a criminal during the incident. <TR>Over time</TR>, public criticism was excessive and police became nervous. <TR>Fortunately</TR>, thanks to the informer's report investigators finally arrested the criminal. The informer knew the face of the criminal through Facebook so he tipped off police. <TR>However</TR>, in the old times, people were no help and could only watch.</EX> People didn't even know when an accident happened.

They immediately talk with others as if they are having a chat sitting together. It is possible to maintain a close relationship with people by social media. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, as I have my own story, I still keep in touch with friends who I met in Brazil via Facebook . There I say hello to friends or write comments on a homepage. There is no big difference from sitting face to face. These kinds of sites are very useful to communicate with friends. If I want to give a friend a message immediately, but the friend cannot take a message, I post on the site.</EX> <TR>To me</TR>, communicating by SNS has no prominent difference from sitting face to face. These kinds of SNS are very useful to communicate with friends. <TR>Moreover</TR>, people can contact and build digital relationships with celebrities who are hard to meet for real. Lots of famous people such as politicians, actors or musicians leave messages on Twitter or Facebook. They have millions of followers and they share feelings and communicate. A fan can chat one-on-one and a celebrity becomes closer and interacts individually with them.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, television plays a key role on maintain good relationship between parents and children.</MI1> <SI1><TR>These days</TR>, it is more difficult for parents to spend time with their children. <TR>This is because</TR> workers are given to busy situation to work in and out of the company. <TR>Naturally</TR>, children do not focus on their parents but computer games and online social networking.

This is not only because learners will obtain variety of knowledge from the activities but also because they can meet new friends from different fields. In this manner I go against the statement above.</TS></IN>

   <BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason for my opinion is that</TR> experiencing many works will provide opportunities for people to learn numerous skills.</MI1> <SI1>In this heavily competitive world, students do various works. Starting from part time job at cafe to volunteer work, they gain many experience from various areas. This can enable them to know and obtain new skills they did not have before. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was in University I joined many social clubs. I was in basketball team and orchestra.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Another reason for my argument is that</TR> individuals can make new friends who can teach us new skills.</MI2> <SI2>Though participating numerous activities do deter people to only concentrate one specific area, it is beneficial to acquire new friends.

Some people think that people should follow their dreams though it is impractical while others do not. <TS>I <TR>however</TR>, believe that it is better for people to follow their dreams. There are several reasons that I could discuss to support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic : the concepts of success and stress.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, <TR>the most important reason for my thinking this way is that</TR> following their dreams is much better way to become successful professionals.</MI1> <SI1>Commonly in society<, a substantial amount of successful professionals tend to be people who followed their dreams and became experts in their respective fields. <TR>Thus</TR> <TR>it can be said that</TR> it is better for people to follow their dreams because they can easily get the expertise and become successful.

 <BO2><EX>A really good example can be seen in Ahn. I read online that Ahn, the CEO of the Ahn Company, transformed his company into one of the most profitable information technology enterprises in Korea because he kept following his dream though it was considered impractical 10 years ago. In one of his interviews, he said that his parents severely disagreed with his dream because it was not a money-making job. <TR>However</TR>, he went forward to study computer science because it was exciting for him. <TR>Eventually</TR> following his dream motivated him to study hard and it led him to create V3 : the most successful vaccine program in Korea.</EX> <TR>This example clearly shows that</TR> people should following their dreams though they are impractical because of the success it entails.</BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Another reason for my thinking this way is that</TR> not following dreams can cause substantial amount of stress.<MI3> <SI3>Most businessmen are stressed out because of the tremendous workload they reluctant to do. <TR>Thus</TR> it can be said that if people don`t follow their dreams and do what they do not want to do, they will receive additional stress which often leads to health problems.

600&People learn more by watching television than by reading books.,::,"<IN>An ongoing debate exists whether learning by watching television is more helpful than learning by reading books. <TS><TR>Regarding this controversial issue</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> people are more likely to learn better through the visual materials such as television rather than written materials like books. <TR>The reasoning behind this is that</TR> learning by watching television enhances the possibility to remember. <TR>Additionally</TR>, people achieve some knowledge more easily by watching television than by reading books.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people can remember what they see in the television better.</MI1> <TR>This is because</TR> when the visual materials are created, producers strive to make it more vivid and effective to stimulate people's imagination. They take all kinds of measures for upgrading both visual and hearing effect to convey their messages. <EX>According to the report released by the National Education Institute in Korea, students who study using television lectures of all subjects perform better than those who study focusing on their reading material for themselves. <TR>It also adds that</TR> students state that they can easily recall what they see in television than those who just read the books.</EX> <TR>As this study shows</TR>, the advantage of learning through watching television outweighs that through reading books.</SI1></BO1><BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, people feel easier when studying by watching television than by reading materials, so that they can learn more with watching television.</MI2> <SI2>Some people argue that reading books makes students get into the discussion which is the best way to make profound reasoning. Such an argument is true in some sense; <TR>however</TR>, in most cases students who are in trouble to read materials are main problems for leading discussion. <TR>In this situation</TR>, watching television on the discussion issue is of great help, because most all students can participate in discussing in the class with ease. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was in high school, my teacher wanted us to read about green-house effect before the next discussion. <TR>Needless to say</TR>, some students did not read nor think about that topic. <TR>However</TR>, my teacher turned on the television and watched documentary on that theme, so that we could continue the discussion and we all had a deep understanding on that topic.</EX></SI2></BO2>

For the following two reasons, I firmly believe that concentrating on one skill is better than studying a variety of skills : to develop speicialty and to increase children's academic performance.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, focusing on one skill enables people to enhance their specialty.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> when people spend most of their time studying their major, they can develop expertise <TR>Moreover</TR>, as modern society is becoming increasingly competitive and specialized, today's job markets require job candidates with such qualities. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, according to a study done by the New York Times in 2010, <TR>it revealed that</TR> the employee interview was the most important in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call. The study indicated that the interviewers looked at the applicant's knowledge and skills, mostly related to specialty. <TR>Thus, this proves that</TR> specialization is a good and safe way for children to prepare for their future.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, concentrating on one skill encourages students to perform with more entusiasm.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</SI2> studying one skill lowers their stress level, which serves as one of the key motivators for them to perform better and inprove themselves. <TR>Moreover</TR>, they can put in their effort, concentrate better on their work, and feel more responsible for their tasks. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, according to a study conduceted by the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2009, <TR>it revealed that</TR> there was a huge difference between two groups of students in achievement.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, limiting people's freedom is necessary to develop the economy of a country.</MI2> <SI2>To achieve the national economic goal, people need to coordinate, and to collaborate, people's freedom should be restricted. This is because, people can unify and consolidate into one community. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, Korea developed its economy in a short period. It took only about 50 years to be one of the richest countries in the world. The government of Korea limited the people's freedom and exagerated the unity of people. In this way, the nation can achieve its economic goal.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, limiting people's freedom can be effective and fast for the country in dangerous situation. <TR>Moreover</TR>, by restricting the freedom of people, the country can develop its economy quickly.

603&Some people say getting too much information causes problems. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>When confronted with the problem of whether too much information causes problems or not, hardly would maintain that too much information is a problem. Most of them think it is good to gain information as much as possible. <TS><TR>However</TR>, too much information is not the best for solving problems or selecting the best choice. There are some problems of getting much information when people encountered a problem.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR> too much information does not actually help solving problems but only makes people feel confident.</MI1> <EX>Suppose a problem of whether a stock market will rise a week after today and 1 information is given to one group of people, 3 information to another group, 5 to yet another group of people, and 10 information to the last group of people. Many people would think that  the group of people who got the best result is the group of people who have 10 information. <TR>However</TR>, some scientists performed the experiment and got a result that the group of people who had the best result was people who had 5 information. People who had 10 information did not good enough to be the best. Instead the level of confidence about their result was highest among the group.</EX> This indicates two things. <TR>First</TR>, there exists a maximum limit for getting best result when gathering information for solving problems. <TR>Second</TR>, as information which people gathered gets larger, people’s confident gets higher even though the result cannot be possibly better. Strong confident can cause problems because people can lose their objectiveness.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, too much information increases the management points.</MI2> <SI2>There exists maximum amount of information that people can handle for their works. If the amounts are acceptable to take care of, information that the person have can be useful. <TR>However</TR>, if there exists too much information and if a person has to care about all of them, the person would be seriously stressed out and possibly make a mistake. In this situation it is more helpful to increase the number of people to take care the management point rather than giving too much information to handle. Giving just too much information only causes mistakes and problems.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, <TR>nowadays</TR>, creativity is most important skill.</MI1> <SI1>This is normally derived from the diverse knowledge.

605&People learn more by watching television than reading books.,::," <IN>There has been heated debate whether people can learn more from the TV than from the books. Some may argue that viewers learn more through TV than just the reading a book,  while others deem otherwise. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I believe that beneficial of books outweigh the TVs. This is not only because books delivers information with detail but because TV is produced basically for entertainment not for education. <TR>Likewise</TR> I go against the statement above.</TS></IN>
    
<BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason for my opinion is that</TR> books deal the information in detail.</MI1> <SI1>Though some people may claim TV also does describe facts along with the sound effect and visual aid, TV program actually omit a lot of information. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, compare to the books, movie Harry Potter does seem to skip some of part. As the running time is limited to 2 to 3 hours, it is not possible to play everything that was depicted at the book. All the details which illustrate how  Harry Potter uses magic wand and how he fly with its magic brooms helps readers to imagine and learn all the marvelous vocabulary. <TR>However</TR>, such scene on the TV is just very small tiny part of the book which does not really help the viewers.</EX> <TR>For this reason</TR> <TR>I think that</TR> TV is not much helpful for learning than the books.</SI1></BO1>
 
    <BO2><MI2><TR>Another reason for my argument is that</TR> TV program is made for fun not for education purpose.</MI1> Numerous TV programs are filmed and played day to day. <SI2><TR>However</TR>, as TV broadcasts are mostly relying on their proceeds from the advertisement and commercial they have to produce programs that are eye catching. <TR>This means</TR> whether it is helpful in giving knowledgeable information, PDs and directors have to primarily consider how it can draw as much attraction as possible. Such act can even distort the actual fact and even hinder viewers from learning anything new. <EX><TR>To take this into illustration</TR>, according to the recent statistic from the Seoul National University 8 out 10 TV program academic programs always had comedian and other celebrities even though they do not have any proper knowledge with the topic. <TR>Also</TR> such programs sometime deal with the issue they are not related to the topic which can deter viewers to concentrate on the topic.</EX> This example illustrates how TV programs are not proper choice for learning.</SI2></BO2>
 
   <CO><TR>Subsequent to mulling over this query</TR>, I disagree with the statement given above. Books are favorable for individuals as they depict tons of information with marvelous vocabulary and statement. <TR>In addition</TR> TV itself does not include much of in-depth information, instead it airs program which tend to focus on comic and violent program to draw more numbers of viewers.

606&Professors should focus on research more than teaching student.,::,"<IN>There is a debate whether professors should focus on their research more than teaching students. <TS><TR>I agree with that</TR> doing study is more important for professors than teaching students for the two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, professor can give valuable research experience to students through more focusing their study. <TR>Second</TR>, it is better for students to get knowledge from their friends.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, for students, research can be the best way to get valuable knowledge that is not written in textbook.</MI1> <TR>Of course</TR>, it also might be a good way for professors to focus on textbook materials for their students' better academic performance. <TR>However</TR>, <TR>these days</TR>, all of knowledge can be available in the Internet.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, it is better for students to ask vague questions to their friends not to their professors.</MI2> <SI2>Professor definitely knows more things related to academic areas than students' friends. <TR>However</TR>, as far as getting understandable academic explanation is concerned, students' friends can give more comprehensible knowledge because students share similar learning environments and backgrounds. <EX>My friends, Su-Jin, can be a good example for above explanation. <TR>At first</TR>, Su-Jin asked questions that are not clear for her in class. <TR>However</TR>, she could not understand professor's explanation because professor said unfamiliar terms and matrixes she first heard. <TR>After class</TR>, she asked me and I explained same explanation using easier terms and examples.

607&businesses should do anything they can to make a profit,::,"<IN><TS>Many Businesses are eager to make better profits. This can lead them to using methods that do not commensurate with current laws, not paying their workers to save more money. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I disagree to the statement that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit because of two reasons; hurting themselves and creating disorder.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, businesses should not do anything they can to make a profit because it would eventually hurt them.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Generally</TR>, when businesses try to increase their profits, they consider breaking the law in some way to detour their hard work . <TR>However</TR>, although it could provide them with a method that allows them to make lots of profits in a short time, it would eventually hurt them. <TR>This is because</TR> when a business does well, competing companies try to search for holes in their success to ensure their success in the business world. <EX>Take my uncle’s faucet company, true waters, for example. When my uncle’s company first started, it did not go well although he tried hard. This lead my uncle to violate the law in order to succeed in his company. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, <TR>although at first</TR>, his company went well after my uncle violated the law, competing companies turned skeptical and irritated of his success and tried to find what lead him to succeed. <TR>However</TR>, after they found out that all of my uncle’s success was not due to his hard work, they requested investigation and my uncles company had to close down with a large amount of debts. <TR>Therefore</TR>, when people do anything to make a profit for their business, it would rather hurt them.</EX></SI1></BO1>

This could also lead to disorder in the company as workers have a limited amount of patience and since they need to rest and spend their time doing other things too. <TR>Therefore</TR>, this could create disorder in the working environment and put an end to a company. <EX>According to a research done by the Korean Statistics Bureau, the respondents, who were CEOs of a small company that had been put to an end, were asked the main cause of their failure.

608&the most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns,::,"<IN>When applying for a job, we consider many aspects; the money the company pays us and whether they have health insurance or if the working environment is encouraging and whether it is what we want to do. <TS>While a lot of these aspects are crucial for a person’s future, the money they earn should be the most important aspect they put into account because it can decide our wealth and heatlh. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I agree to the statement that the most important aspect of a job is the money a person earns because of two reasons; stability and pursuing our dreams.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the money a person earns from their job, can be mentally healthy because it gives them stability in their lives.</MI1> <SI1>While some people state that doing what we want is the most aspect of a person’s job, <TR>it is obvious that</TR> without money people cannot be stable.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, attending a live performance could be harmful to our health.</MI1> <EX>Many live concerts tend to have speakers, which have their volume fully raised.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the ability to relate well to people can bring more profits to the company.</MI1> <SI1>Today’s society is called the capitalism. <TR>In this society</TR>, the corporation is one of the major factors, and to success, it is important to do well in the corporation. <TR>Further</TR>, to do well in the company, people should make as many profits as possible to the company. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is important to get along with people, because good relationship brings more profits. <TR>To be specific</TR>, the company should make profits from their customers. <TR>Thus</TR>, employees of the company should make good relationship with customers, so that they can buy more products from the company.</SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason for my opinion is that</TR> youth are too busy to give support.</MI1> <SI1>In this heavily competitive world, not only finding job is tough but working day to night is tiresome as well.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Another reason for my argument is that</TR> young people do not think it is essential to aid the community.</MI2> <SI2>Though it might be common courteous for everyone in the town to work together when they face any of issue, not everyone, especially young people do not much care. With the advent of modern technology like internet and IT invention,  it enabled young people to spend time alone.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, planning carefully encourages people to improve a sense of responsibility.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> planning requires many obligations, such as managning their schedules widely, abiding by rules, cooperating with other members.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermoe</TR>, managing own time carefully allows people to perform with more enthusiasm.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> having careful plan help people feel confidence because they don't feel fear. Having confidence can serve as  one of the key motivators for them to perform better and to improve themselves.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, desertification is progressed at a fast speed.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Usually</TR>, desertification is caused by human activities, and these activities are somewhat prohibited by restrictions made by goverment. <EX><TR>In Africa</TR>, many people cut trees and plants because of their hunger. <TR>However</TR>, since these greenery plants have positive effects to provide wild plants and animals with appropriate environment to live, the devastation of the habitat for the nature deprive of the wild lives.</EX> If goverment keep people from destroying the nature by the law, various creatures in the wild may be able to exist. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, the Keynan goverment prevented people from cutting trees without the permission from goverment. With this persistent endeavor over 10 -year period, the speed of desertification became slower, and some species of birds increased their number.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, many creatures in the wild are being extinct.</MI2> <SI2>Many people hunt wild animals for the purpose of money. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, <TR>in Korea</TR>, <TR>in the past</TR>, some people hunt bears and wild boars to sell in the underground market. <TR>As a result of this</TR>, the numbers of these animals are rapidly declined. <TR>Thus</TR>, the Korean goverment stipulated these indicreet hunt illegal, and levied a heavy fines for the hunters. <TR>Fortunately</TR>, this effort was proved effective, the number of wild animals started to increased again.</EX> <TR>I think</TR> this shows the efficiency of govermental efforts.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>By way of concluion</TR>, <TR>based on the arguments above</TR>, <TR>I am of the opinion that</TR> wild lives are protected by the govermental efforts.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, School is not just a place where we get the information and learning.

627&what is something that you would like to study in school?,::,"<IN>The world is becoming more and more globalized, and last few decades, there's been a significant awareness as to the importance of international language. While many still are being adamant on their thoughts that keeping regional language is more important, we can't deny the fact that the international language is becoming more of a matter of must rather a choice. <TS><TR>Likewise</TR>, <TR>given choice</TR>, I would personally like to study English in school and my reasons are economical, educational, and social.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, one of the great advantages that comes along with learning English is that a person  gets to have better opportunity to be successful in the society.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is because</TR> the demand for a person being able to speak is increasing higher than ever before. <TR>Due to globalization</TR>, companies are bound to be connected with companies overseas. And this created a phenomenon called English obssession.
<EX><TR>For example</TR>, <TR>in my school years</TR>, I remember putting in as much as 5 hours a day just to get better score on English test called Toefl. And those who had failed to get wanted score felt devastated, while those who had managed to obtain high score might've been self-esteem.</EX> This is just one of many examples that show the significance of English in recent years.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, making friends with people from different parts of the world has been made possible as more and more people are now able to speak English.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In the past</TR>, even if one wanted to broaden his views and perspective by having relationship with those half way around the world, so called ""language barrier' kept them from making it happen. With a help of language that connects the world in the way not present in the past, it's not too far-fetched to say that there's no such thing as different languages anymore. <EX><TR>Last year</TR>, I went to France for the purpose of having a little getaway after a long period of hard-working, I was a little anxious at the fact that I didn't have any information regarding France, which includes where the good restaurants are. <TR>However</TR>, my worries proved me wrong, because everything could've been dealt with just by asking locals. <TR>And</TR> this might've been impossible without English skill.</EX></SI2></BO2>

628&It is important for the government to protect wild animals and wilderness places for the future generation.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not it is important for the government to protect wild animals and wilderness places for the future generation. The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, <TR>the jury may still be out</TR>, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> governments should preserve wild animals and wilderness places for the future generation. <TR>In this essay</TR>, <TR>I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.</TR> <TR>First</TR>, by doing it, people release their stress level. <TR>Second</TR>, it helps them succeed in their life.</TS></IN>

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, visiting wilderness places significantly reduce one’s stress level.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> watching wild animals and natures distracts one from worries and anxiety. <TR>Thus</TR>, this simple and quick escape from the reality may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there had been a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if governments have to protect their wild animals for the future generation. <TR>Of all</TR>, 78.1 percent of them stated that governments have to concentrate on preserving wildness places. <TR>This is because</TR> it helps their citizen relieve stress and settle down, as they are likely to forget their worries while watching wild animals and natures. <TR>Thus</TR>, governments have to spend their budget on protecting wilderness places because their citizen can stay healthy without stress.</EX></SI1></BO1>

            <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, being educated about the importance of preservation of wilderness places from an early age has a direct correlated to success in life.</MI2> <SI2><TR>As the saying goes</TR>, “Old habits die hard.” <TR>This indicates that</TR> people cannot make sudden dramatic changes in life, such as controlling their desires and behaviors one morning. <EX><TR>According to an article</TR>, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor at Harvard University in America claimed: “Modern students have to learn the importance of wildlife protection because it allows students to be successful in their life. <TR>It is obvious that</TR> students who have been taught about wildlife protection will be likely to consider their heritage valuable in comparison to those who have not. <TR>For this reason</TR>, they can have the ability to develop their heritage and create the newest values by doing it, which helps them being specialized job candidates.”</EX> <TR>Hence</TR>, wildlife protection by government is crucial for the future generation since it helps them to be successful in their life.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, since parents spend more time with their children, children are easily influenced by their parents’ lifestyle.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In fact</TR>, children only spend six or seven hours a day at school and the
rest of time at home with their parents. <TR>In other words</TR>, children learn more from their parents’
daily routine such as how they talk each other, how they greet other people and how they eat etc. <EX><TR>One day</TR>, I watched a TV program about students who are accepted into Ivy League. A common habit they have was they love reading various books. They said that they used to spend time with their parents in the library and discuss issues from books what they read.

their parents’ lifestyle.</EX></SI1></BO1>
            
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addtion</TR>, parents are people who know their children best; <TR>therefore</TR>, they know how to motivate their children.</MI2> Parents know their children since they were born, while teachers have
many children to take care of in a class and children do not always have same teachers every
year. <SI2><TR>Therefore</TR>, parents know their children better about what their children’s strengths and
weaknesses are. <EX><TR>Best example is my mother.</TR> Since she knew that I am introverted until I feel

competitions and recitals to perform in front of other people. <TR>When I look back</TR>, this experience

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, <TR>in my opinion</TR>, teachers are the best teachers for their children because the way of parents’ life can easily affect children’s lifestyle in daily life such as reading and exercising and

you have in the touring scene and environment. <TR>Not only that but also</TR> you can reduce the traveling expenses in various ways. These two factors are crucial in
determining what a sucessful trip is, <TR>thus</TR> the following excamples and explanations will help your understanding.</TS></IN>
  
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, going on a whole new and unfamiliar area is an adventurous challenge, even though the place is made suitable for foreign tourists.</MI1> <SI1>Language barriers, cultural differences,
pharmaceutical and food issues are just the few matters that we have to mediate with. If you were all alone in such a location with so much demand, you will have less time and resources
to enjoy what you have planned for, in the first place. <TR>However</TR>, if you're accompanied with few others, you'll have a much bigger chance to solve out these problems easier. <EX><TR>For
example</TR>, I went on a trip to Turkey with my college friends last summer, and despite preparing for the trip for a long time, none of us were able to be fluent in Turkish language.
<TR>Starting from the first day of arrival</TR>, we struggled to communicate with the locals, and had a hard time finding our Hotel, but were able to minimize the confusion by gathering our heads
 together with our individual information and ideas. One of my friend used frequently used Turkish words to explain our destination, while the other used map and body language to
express our needs. It was a terrific team work and the locals had little problem understanding us. Were it not for the team work, I would not have had found a place to stay for the whole day.</EX></SI1></BO1>
   
<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, traveling with companions is an effective means to reduce one's traveling expenses.</MI2> <SI2>Many of the tourist locations offer discounts to group of visitors. <EX><TR>It has been announced in the
annual report from the Ministry of culture and tourism, that</TR> 95% of major tourist locations around the world implement group discout policies to attract more visitors.</EX> This also applies to
restraunts and suvenior shops or Theater ticket purchasements. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I visited Australia last year with my family, me and my five other family members recieved discounts
in Koala Forest walk program, Ozzy fish and chips diner, and even for the Theater show held at the Opera House in Sydney. We were able to save an additional airline ticket price, back to our hometown.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>As a result</TR>, Traveling with companion not only secures your timely and financial resources, <TR>but also</TR> it allows you to relax and enjoy the trip as a whole. <TR>Based on the reasons mentioned above</TR>, <TR>I definitely believe</TR> traveling with companions have a lot to offer than traveling alone.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,3,::,0,::,"This essay has a thesis that is unnecessarily drawn out, but the main ideas behind it are supported with good examples.",//

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people spend most of time at work.</MI1> <TR>This shows that</TR> it is very important to be familiar, friendly, and get along well with them. If you do not get along with them well, it will be difficult for you to be at the work place for a long time, feeling uncomfortable.

If you spend enjoyable time more with people at work, it will be a great opportunity for you to a chance to be close with them, making a comfortable place for everyone, and also resulting in better quality of work. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there was a study conducted by Seoul National University in 2006. There were two groups, group A with people new to each other and group B people with their close friends.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, it develops skills of studying.</MI1> <SI1>I would like to focus on two of several skills - creativity and writing skill.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, students can understand the class better by doing homework.</MI2> <SI2>Teachers usually give assignments which is associated with the class, and by doing homework, students can preview the subject which will be learned tomorrow. <TR>In addition</TR>, they can also review the subject that they are taught yesterday.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, it is better to actually visit the country to learn about it because it is more memorable and there will be things that you will learn more than just knowing things that you should know in museums.</MI1> <SI1>The information and knowledge you got from visiting its country will last long and beacuse you felt the country with your skin and you will be able to think deeply. <TR>I am quite sure</TR> it will teach more than the words from books. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, <TR>in Korea</TR>, people take off their shoes before they come into the house.

<BO2><MI2><TR>The second reason is that</TR> facial communication doesn‘t cause ambiguous of meaning, which often cause conflict in the middle of dialogue.</MI2> <SI2>When we talk with others, we stare at his eyes, hear his tone of voice and see his gesture. <TR>After gathering the signals from him</TR>, we can catch the implied meaning. <TR>However</TR>, if we communicate with others through letter or e-mail or phone, we inevitably use only one sense or imperfect sense. <EX><TR>According to the investigation conducted by Harvard University in 2011</TR>, it show us amazing fact- the more people use their sense in talk, the more they understand the hidden meaning. <TR>It imply that</TR> when we have facial connections, we escape from imperfect and obscure meanings.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, sports can improve students' ability in mind in respect of mental sphere.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example</TR>, <TR>in many studies conducted by the National Research of Korea</TR>, it is found that working regulary on a daily basis actually can improve students' performance at university and that can increase intellectual quotient instantly. <TR>also</TR>, as the old saying goes, a sound mind in a sound body.</EX></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, whether children play sports for either fun or competition, it will be more helpful if the purpose fits to their purpose.</MI1> <SI1>Children who want to play sports just for fun, would like to play it for their happiness or the cooperation with their friends. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, those who want to play sports for competition, would like to play it for their professional career. <TR>That is</TR>, just let children play sports for their purpose, so that they can play it freely. <EX>I read the newpaper article states that just letting children play for their own purpose is more helpful than restricting them to play it for one purpose which is opressed by others. <TR>In this sense</TR>, <TR>I believe that</TR> the goal why children want to play sports is more important.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, letting children to play sports for any purpose is more effiecient.</MI2> <SI2>Most children want to do something they like, and there will be no children who do their work that they don' like.

<BO1>Environmental issue is an imminent problem that determines our physical life.Fresh air allows us to breathe in oxygen for sustaining life, and the health of many living things determine health of human beings. <MI1>Air and water pollution should be addressed immediately because it directly affects the very existence of our life.</MI1> <SI1>Water pollutant contained in drinking water poses great danger to our health and should be addressed by controlling  waste disposal. <EX><TR>It is observed that</TR> air holds much more carbon dioxide than oxygen which needs sequestration of carbon dioxide and establishing green environment.

Some people believe that home-made food is still better than eating out in restaurants or buying food from food stands while others argue the opposite side. <TS><TR>In this essay</TR>, <TR>I think</TR> eating outside has more advantageous than making our own food at home since it is easier to meet our nutrients and more efficient for time consumption and expenditures.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, eating outside or buying food from food stands is better for our health than spending only home-made foods.</TR> <SI1>Some people would argue that home-made food is better for health because it is more safe and believable. <TR>Although this argument is partly true</TR>, it lacks the assumption that all foods can be made at home, which is almost not possible for most of people in these days. To meet the appropriate nutrients for a human being, various kinds of foods are required such as vitamin, calcium, protein and so on. If people make their own food for their health, they may have to spend most of time for cooking. It wouldn’t be desirable situation. <TR>On the other hands</TR>, if people buy food from outside such as restaurants or food stand, they can easily take the food and get the appropriate nutrients. It is easier and faster for people living in modern society.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, eating out from restaurants or buying food from food stands can both save time and money for food.</MI2> <SI2>Restaurants or food stands are usually specialized in some particular foods, which are cooked with a large amount, consequently decreasing food price. They are mostly cheaper than home-made food if the cookings are constituted with the same ingredients. Since home-made food cannot be cooked with a large amount, it cannot be cheaper than the food in restaurants or food stands. <TR>In addition</TR>, home-made food needs more time for cooking. <TR>When we eat outside</TR>, we just need to wait after order. <TR>However</TR>, when we make our own food at home, we need to wait for cooking, which is time consuming.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, television tends to bring negative effects on people.</MI1> <SI1>One effect is addiction. <TR>As some people call</TR>, the television has a nickname, a “fool box”. Television contains lots of news and functions; it brings international, political, and economic news and entertainments like dramas and documentaries. While people watch television, they only focus on what is on it, <TR>later</TR>, falling for it. <TR>If this continues</TR>, then watchers will eventually be addict to television. <EX><TR>Once</TR>, Korean Central Newspaper posted an article of how television makes a person addict. It surveyed the time of how much people watch television by ages and genders, and the increased rate of patients, addicted to television, as years pass by. In 1960, when television was first introduced in Korea, there were no patients and not many people were able to see it due to high prices. <TR>However</TR>, in 2000, the rate of patients increased to about 30 percent of television audiences and kids watched more than adults did. <TR>As this mounted year by year</TR>, kids’ addiction to television became a severe issue in Korean society.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, television reduces communications.</MI2> <SI2>Communication has always been important to people because it tends to decrease depression. <TR>With telephones</TR>, people can talk and discuss many things; favorite foods, actors, daily live and etc. Television however, makes one fall for it rather than discuss about it. <EX>I participated in Medical Youth Society in high school, and our club hosted a guest speaker who talked about a decrease rate of conversations around the family due to technologies.

When we do not have a true conversation like we did before they were invented, and it is scientifically proven by researchers?” </EX> This quote really came into my mind because as a person, who does not like to watch television, I totally agreed with her. Watching television may influence one in a harmful way.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the idea that improving schools is the best way of advancing a country is not a way for all countries.</MI1> <SI>A country where most people are not educated might need to imporve their schools, but for developed countries like the United States or Western countries, improving schools is not the best way, since those countries already equiped with numerous schools. <EX>For example, in the early 1900s in Korea, this way was a only and the most effective way to improve the quality of a country, becuase people in those days were not educated. But today in Korea, most people are educated and there is no more need to improve schools, instead there might be need to improve other aspects that is lacked in the society.</EX></SI> In this sense, i think the concept that enhancing schools is the best way to promote a country is not correct.</BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> expanding budgets on the university libraries would benefit the whole students on their academic learning.</MI1><SI1>Most of the students on campus utilize its library in some way; in order to search textbooks for their papers, surf on the Internet, or to have a meeting with their study groups. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, <TR>however</TR>, not all students use school gym except for those who are athletics. <TR>Thus</TR>, expanding more funds to the library would be more advantageous for student’s academic performances. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, <TR>last year</TR>, I really had some trouble finishing my paper work. My professor wanted students to write a paper about one specific book for an essay, and everyone wanted to reserve that book in order to read it through and write about it. <TR>Hence</TR>, that one book was on reserve for several months and I had to wait for others to return it before the deadline.</EX> These kinds of problem would be solved when the university budgets more on the resources at the library department, making it convenient and easy for students to enhance their academic abilities.</EX></SI1></BO1>
     
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, a big library system on campus would work as a promotion to new students.</MI2> <SI2>Library is a great place to concentrate on studying with lots of resources, and also is a great facility to hold group meetings. <TR>So</TR>, most of the students spend their time in the library rather than staying at their dormitories. <TR>Thus</TR>, advancement in the library department would persuade more new students who seek for true education and an opportunity to study in comfort. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I usually make my study group schedules in the library.

666&The news media is a reliable source of unbiased information,::,"<IN>With the advance of media, the news media have served as provider of information. Therefore a great number of people are considering this news media as a reliable source of unbiased information.<TS>However, I certainly believe that the information offered by news media can be biased in that the media company producing news media is operated for profit and political leaders sometimes use the news media for their purpose.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost,</TR> news is produced under the company who seek for profit. It is obvious that the media company is not the non-profit organization, therefore, inevitably their act depends on how their act influence on profit, which also affect news media and make the information unreliable.</MI1><SI1><EX>For example, nowadays, many media company rely their financial aspects on advertisement from the big company.</EX> So, they need to please this company needs in order to make sure continuing advertisement from the company. </SI1>As a result, they sometimes arrange the information in news in a good way for them by adding good news for them instead of showing negative news for them.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the top of that,</TR> the government or political leaders can have great influence on the media.

"667&Because environmental issues are very complex, individuals can do nothing about them on their own.",::,"<IN>Some people think that individuals cannot do anything for the environment because environmental issues are too complex. <TS>However, in my opinion, I think that people can do many things to improve the environment.</TS> This is because people can use public transportation in lieu of their personal vehicles, and because they can use the less amount of water.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> public transportation can be an effective tool for improving environment.</MI1><SI1>To be specific, in the public transportation such as bus and subway, many people ride a same car at the same time. Thus, some pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, would be emitted the less amount than personal vehicles do. As a result, air pollution would be decreased. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University in 2008, after many people used more automobiles, 10 times more pollutants were found in the atmosphere when compared to before. Also, cars emit CO2 and SO2 which bring about acid rain. And acid rain acidifies the top soils.</EX> Therefore, environment is further exacerbated. After Korean government had announced a policy that tax more money on people who have cars, the rate of using personal vehicles decreased. Consequently, pollutants in the air were disappeared 30%.</SI1></BO1>

In this respect, some people come to believe that children should be the one who should make their own decisions. <TS>As for me, however, I agree with the statement saying that important decisions should not be considered by children themselves for the following two reasons. First of all, they are not mature enough to take the risks. Secondly, problems that children face these days are too complicated.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> children are not old enough to take the burdens of making decisions.</MI1><SI1>This is because they are likely to choose something that they like, not the best choice s for them.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> many concerns in modern societies are too sophisticated for a child to handle.</MI2> <SI2>As the world is changing every moment, there are certain aspects that children are not able to look into or might neglect although it seems insignificant.

671&Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space(for example traveling to the Moon and to other planets).

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> there are still lots of people who are suffering from the lack of basic necessities.</MI1> <SI1>To put it in another way, we can find out starving people or distressed unemployed people, who are really seeking to a way to live a proper life. As there is a limit to government budget, setting a priority is important. In this circumstance where numerous people are still below the poverty line, the most necessary step government should take is to help them. This is the reason why government exist and why people pay taxes. <EX>For example, India is one of the most populous countries in the world, four times more than Brazil, which has similar territory. However, the living standard of these two countries is really huge, as around 35% of the Indian is in poverty whereas only 5% of the Brazilian is.</EX> Contrary to the fact that the India government invested the budget for outer space program, which was shamefully with no fruit, the Brazilian government focused on meeting basic demands of people instead. The current differences between them stem from this different policy and this is why we have to invest money for our basic needs.</SI1></BO1>

673&Television has had a significant influence on the culture of many societies. To what extent would you say that television has positively or negatively affected the cultural development of your society?,::,"<IN>Many people  believe that television has had a positive influence on the culture of many societies. They argue that television transfers lots of information to people and helps them know various society's cultures. <TS>However, I disagree with this argument and think television actually has negatively affected the cultural development of our society. My view can be greatly substantiated by the reason addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> television has made people become passive and this leads the regression of civilization.</MI1> <SI1>In other words, people in nowadays, who should play a pivotal role in developing the culture of society, are not thinking creatively because of the influence of television. People tend to accept information from television with no criticism, <EX>according to a study conducted by MIT research team. They investigate how media can affect people's thinking abilities. Among many mediums, television is the worst media as it affects viewers to become passive. They just absorb information and knowledge from television and believe it is true, even if it is wrong.</EX>This is harmful to the cultural development of society. The improvement of our society requires critical, voluntary, creative and active attitude toward received information and knowledge. Because television lacks these qualities, I firmly believe television is negative to our society.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> television has made the culture of society monotonous.</MI2> <SI2>To put it in another way, it has devastated the diversity of culture in our society. Some people think through television, the globalization, which means the development of cultural diversity, has been achieved. However, it is totally wrong. In fact, this globalization through television has destroyed many valuable cultural inherits. Due to many television programs and advertisements, people not only buy one specific goods, but also imitate things what they see. Especially, as most of the television programs are produced based on American society, people around the world have abandoned their own culture and adopted the style of America. <EX>For example, South Korean no longer wear their traditional clothes and eat their foods. What they do is what Americans do, which is the same.</EX> One famous philosopher refer to the globalization as 'Americanization' which clearly reflect the negative impact of cultural diversity of the world.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>We agree that the cultural development appeared the most in the Renaissance age. At that time, people did not have any television, only many debatements and discussions existed among creative people. However, it was these characteristics that actually led society to the cultural improvement of the society. From this historical example, I can support the idea that not television, but other things that advocate the creative ideas really make the development of the society.</CO>",::,4,::,2,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,0,::,"I was impressed by this student's strong command of English vocabulary and grammar which, while not perfect, was very close to it.

675&Young people enjoy life more than older people,::,"<IN>Some people think that old people can more enjoy their life than young people do. <TS>However I think that younger people will have more enjoyable life than old people in that young people have suitable tendency for making life valuable and old people usually have many responsibilities.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost,</TR> when it comes to change, young people tend to have more positive mind since they don’t have fearsome about change, instead they more have curious and want to experience new things as much as they can.</MI1> <SI1>Therefore young people are willing to accept and learn about new things or change easily, which make their life more variety. <EX>There is a poll by Korean government indicating that 95 percentage of the people who range from 20 to 25 show desire to study abroad.</EX> Considering that living in another country require lots of challenge and change, we can see young people are likely to enjoy change, which help them enjoy their life.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> there are many things that old people have to take care about.</MI2> <SI2>Old people usually the person who get married and have their child at home. These all require tons of responsibilities for old people. Therefore, old people have to consider these duties when they make new attempt to their life, Which makes it hard for old people to enjoy their life. <EX>For example, my uncle is working at the publication company as an editor. The works he deals with are quite burdensome, so he needs some time for refreshing himself. He thinks traveling all over the world can recharge his energy.</EX> However he just can’t do this because he has to care for his family and make money for them. If he took the trip all over the world, the financial condition of his family will be in trouble.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> young people have characteristics that make it easy for them to accept change and it is hard to attempt new things in their life for old people. Consequently, I contend that the life of young people is more enjoyable than that of old people.</CO>

676&Being able to speak well is more important than being able to write well,::,"<IN>There has been an argument concerning whether being able to speak well is more important than being able to write well. A growing number of people believe that writing ability is more important. <TS>However, I firmly believe that speaking well is more useful and important ability in one’s life.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons to support my opinion.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> people spend more time talking than writing.</MI1> <SI1>They have to speak for many reasons. Specifically, people speak to persuade, argue, and explain. People cannot live without speaking. <EX>For example, there are still many people who cannot write, but they can express their opinion and live well without writing.</EX> However, if people cannot speak well, it will cause problems.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover,</TR> I have learned English for many years.<MI2> <SI2>What I usually studied was reading and writing.

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I agree with the statement that being able to speak well is more important than being able to write well. The reason is that speaking ability is more needed in real life.

677&All University students should be required to take basic science courses.,::,"<IN>I often ask myself ""Why do I have to take some of these required classes at the school?"". <TS>To me, some of the courses I had to take always seem unnecessary.</TS> Especially, subjects that I'm not interested in like math and science.  When I think of materials I learn in math or science classes, it feels like I would never use most of information I learned. I believe that after certain basic level of education, there is not much of necessary information we need in our real lives. in other words, we don't need that high level of education to live our general lives.Then, do all university students should be required to take basic science courses after they take required science courses in high schools? Definitely not. First of all, there's no point of taking science class when we are not in the science related field. At the same time, we don't need to know that high quality-information to live our every day lives.</IN>
    
<BO1><MI1>University is the place students go to study more on what they want to work on later day of their lives.</MI1> <SI1>A lot of students make their decisions on majors very carefully since university gets them closer in to the field. Depending on different majors students, students get various kinds of courses. As students take their courses to meet the requirement to get degree on their majors, they get to study on that particular subject deeply and become more and more professional. It is very natural for those of who are working on science related field to take science courses but there are lots of students who are in that field and not willing to study science. <EX>In my case, I am very interested in language and literature so I want to go to the school that has good language programs and literature programs.</EX> I would not want to take required science courses because I am not willing to study on science and it is not going to help strengthen my career.</SI1></BO1> 
    
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> I am not going to need to know about all the details in science because we just don't use those knowledge at all.</MI2> <SI2>Who cares about how the mercury dioxide can form certain chemical and how the genetic mutation can cause serious problem?

However, in my opinion, <TS>I think that television should be used for education rather than entertainment.</TS> This is because television is an effective tool for educating children, and because it would cause negative effects on children, if it is used for entertainment.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> television has potential to teach children efficiently.</MI1> <SI1>To be specific, images and sounds of television allow young kids to obtain materials at faster rate, ranging from elementary information to professional information. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University in 2008, there were two groups of people observed with the different studying condition: Group A was offered televisions to watch about certain topics, and Group B was given books to read about same topics. Later, both groups took quizzes and the result showed that Group A had a higher accurate in understanding the content, whereas Group B was quite confused with different terms and various versions of the story.</EX> This implies that reading books is not as practical as watching TV.</SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> traffic jam is one of biggest reason why people usually oppose to establishing a large mall.</MI1> <SI1>When a gigantic shopping center comes into our neighborhood, they make us twice time tougher to get to our house, which can play a significant role to some people when they decided to move there. <EX>In my case, now I live in a city named Istanbul, which is a mega-city consists of a number of buildings.</EX> In other words, there are enough large shopping centers in my surroundings.

685&Venus Habitation,::,"<IN><TS>The lecturer claims that there are solutions to nullify the problems with living on Venus. This counters the reading passage's claim that it is unlikely for human beings to habit on Venus because of some serious problems.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> the lecturer asserts that we can live in the man-made structures that are high up in the atmosphere.</MI1> <SI1>Because atmosphere above the surface fifty kilometers has similar pressure with that of the Earth. Thus, nothing would be crushed while it is trying to landing. This contradicts the reading passage's claim that 90 times higher air pressure on Venus would prevent humans to live on Venus.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> the lecturer argues that it is possible to obtain water and oxygen via chemical reaction.</MI2> <SI2>We can isolate oxygen from the Venus's atmospheric gases to attain water. <EX>For example, there are carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere.</EX> And these can be transformed to water and oxygen by chemical reaction and electrical spark. This casts doubt on the reading passage's claim that it is almost impossible to keep supplying water and oxygen.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>Finally,</TR> the lecturer mentions that it is able to gain heat energy from the sun on Venus. This is because gas layer is not really thick, and man-made structure is in high up atmosphere.

This refutes the reading passage's claim that we cannot attain enough heat energy because thick gas layer inhibits sunlight to reach the surface of Venus.</CO>

686&it is a better to do things one at a time than to do many things at once,::,"<IN><TS>It is evident in our society that time has a tremendous importance in our lives.</TS> As society change more quickly, Some people believe that it is a better to do many things at once, While others do not. However, from my point of view, no matter how fast the world is changing, doing things one at a time is more beneficial. There are several reasons I discuss to support my argument so I will my discussion to the two that I feel are mst relevant to the topic. First, it can save time. Also, people can receive less stress.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> to do things one at a time allow people to save a great amont of time.</MI1> <SI1>Commonly in society, people tends to manage their time efficiently. If people can do many things at once, company may let them do more things to do. Thus, they can not enjoy and manage time. <EX>From my personal experience, I  was very tired when i was in sophomore in college. This was due to the fact that I tried doing many things at once.</EX> Therefore, I have no time to enjoy my college time. On the other hand, My friend Minji received scholarship because she always did her things at a time. As this outcome shows, it is better to do things once at a time.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> Doing many things at once can people receive a lot of stress.</MI2> <SI2>Nowadays people are stressed out. This is because there are too many things to do. Doing many thing at once is not necessary for health. A recent article I read on the Korea Herald revealed some interesting findings. <EX>According to the article, a surprising numbers of people in company claimed that they are stressed out. I found it interesting because this was due to requirement from comany that they need work and discover new technology and do other things simultaneoulsy.</EX> This clearly shows that doing many things at once is not useful to life and make them angry.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> he is very famous soccer player.</MI1> <SI1>He is fast and powerful. However, he is technical, too. I think he is the best soccer player ever. He is small like me, but no one can stop him in the field because he is so fast to catch. My dream was to becoming a soccer player when I was young. When I was young, I ran for Seoul soccer team. I got trophy, too. However, I had to stop playing soccer because my parents told me that I am not good enough and my height was too short. But Messi is small too. So I like very much.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> he do not know how to forgive something.</MI2> <SI2>When he was young many teams did not let him in as a player because he was too small, However, he really wanted to became soccer player so he practiced everyday to improve his soccer technic.

688&Universities and high school should teach students about specific careers and fields instead of general subjects.,::,"<IN>Some people think that teaching specific careers is better for students than teaching general subjects. <TS>However, in my opinion, I think that universities and high schools have to teach general subjects for students.</TS> This is because experiencing a variety of subjects would help students to decide future careers that are most fit with them, and because having abundant basic knowledge would help students to adapt themselves to the society.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> by dealing with many subjects, students can choose their better future careers.</MI1> <SI1>To be specific, studying fruitful subjects would lead students to find their aptitude. Students would learn subjects more ardently to find their aptitude. Thus, efficiency would rise. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University in 2008, Students in high school A and B were examined by researchers: School A just taught students specific subjects instead of general subjects, whilst School B provided students with general subjects. Because students in School B could experience enough subjects, they could easily find what they want to do and what they want to be in the future.</EX> As a result, they were more willing to learn. Interestingly enough, students in School B show higher rate in getting jobs than those in School A do.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> it is important in the society to acknowledge fundamental knowledge.</MI2> <SI2>To be specific, if people lack elementary understanding, they may be underestimated by others. Therefore, they cannot socially behave well and be ignored by others. <EX>For example, my uncle attended the high school which only provided students with specific subjects. When my uncle went to the society, many people did not treat him politely.</EX> If he had learn general subjects, he would have not been belittled by others.</SI2></BO2>

689&All students should be required to take history courses.,::,"<IN>There aren't enough students dreaming to have a career related to history in the future these days. It is because many people think that history is not important comparing to other subjects such as language, math, science etc. <TS>However, I strongly believe that all students should learn about our past.</TS> Universities should require students to take history courses because history not only raises responsibility as a citizen but also prevent making same mistakes that happened in the past.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> by learning history, university students can raise responsibilities as citizens in their own country, and even in the world.</MI1> <SI1>Students who will lead our future can raise more interests about our society which will finally result in patriotism. <EX>To illustrate, I studied Korean history to get an certification for 3 months last semester. As I studied more and more, I soon sank into our past, and concentrate on the stories in the lecture.</EX> Especially, in Japanese colonial era, I was impressed by our respond to protect Korea from Japan such as 3.1 movement. Even though I already passed the exam and get certified now, I still study and search more about our history. By learning it for few months, I not only got interested in our past, but also our present and future, and I now dream to work for our country in the future. Therefore, history raises patriotism which is one of the most essential qualities that future leaders should have.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> there will be a less chance to make same mistakes in the future when students take history courses in universities.</MI2> <SI2>When they become a working member of society, they will cope with various problems that might even influence their whole careers. By learning history, they can learn what decisions they should make by learning the reasons and results of many incidents that happened in the past. It will also benefit our society since there will be many leaders who can make a right decision to improve our country. <EX>For instance, my aunt who chose history as her major when she was in her university, now lives a successful social life.</EX> It is possible because she learned how to think logically and make less mistakes by learning history. Thus, learning history can let students make less mistakes in their future career.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To conclude,</TR> history is one of the most important subjects that a person has to learn in their life. And university seems to be the best place to learn about it since it is the last course to prepare their careers for students.

The world definitely seems better than the past.  There are some people, however, say that that the world did not go better, rather it went worse than the past. <TS>From my perspective though, I agree with the statement above.</TS> It is because technology made people to enjoy more and helped not to starve.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly,</TR> people nowadays have more things to enjoy than the past.</MI1> <SI1>In the past, there were not much things to do, and that is why ancient people just looked up on the sky at night and thought about stars and the creation of earth.  However, thanks to the technology, people have bunch of things to do nowadays. <EX>For example, I can call my friend with cell phone and ask him to come over to my house to play baseball. Also, I can go to my friend’s house which is an hour away with a car and play video games.</EX>  None of these happened in the past.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> there are more things to eat, so people do not starve.</MI2> <SI2>Technology made crops to grow more stable than ever.

In the past, however, people starved except the aristocrats and royal families.  As many people say, starving is one of the most painful things to go through. Since people have no problem with less eating nowadays, it can be said that it is a better world to live in.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I firmly agree that the world we live today is better than the past.  Modern society provides more things to enjoy and eat.

692&Some people say that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems.

However, this powerful informative system also has brought us some serious problems. <TS>I agree with this perspective for a couple of reasons: children can easily approach to violate or sexual contents and many contents from the Internet are not accurate.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> people, especially children, become more accessible to the information containing sexual and violate contents through the Internet.</MI1> <SI1>To be specific, in order to develop children's personality well, many parents prohibit their children from watching sexual or violate scenes when they are young. However, since the Internet, it becomes relatively easier for children to watch those contents at home. This can lead them to behave aggressively. <EX>For example, a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Education of Korea shows that the number of children who have ever watched adult movies are more than two third of the population.</EX> The report also mentions that most of children access to the contents through the Internet.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of the claim above,</TR> the information from the Internet is frequently inaccurate.</MI2> <SI2>Specifically, although many people use the Internet for searching for what they want to know, many sources from the Internet are from anonymous, so the information is less reliable than from books or experts. <EX>For example, few years ago, my friend and I argued with a Korean grammar issue.

693&Students can get as many benefits from organization or club activities as they can get from academic studies. Agree or Disagree,::,"<IN>Having a professional knowledge is regarded as the essential element to success. When learning knowledge people usually listen to lecture and read a book. However, nowadays, companies are very interested in hiring people who not only are able to collaborate with others but also have good relationship with other people, and these two things can be learned through activities in organization and clubs. <TS>Thus, I believe that organization and club activities are able to provide as many advantages as academic studies.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with,</TR> club activities allow people to have relationship with club members.</MI1> <SI1>As they frequently communicate with members, they are able to make friends with them. This brings a lot of benefits, especially while running a business. It makes much more easier for people to get products that they need for business. This also enable people know recent information. Besides, achieving contraction with friends would be much more easier than achieving it with people that you are not familiar with. When it comes to students, having a lot of friends enables them to borrow books that they might need and learn academical things that they didn't understand. In other words, if there are problems that one cannot solve alone, one can ask his friends to give advice and helps. In this respect, joining in organization and club activities bring good relationships with people which is highly helpful.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore,</TR> when participating in organization, people learn cooperation skill.</MI2> <SI2>As shown above, cooperating with team members is highly significant.

In real business, workers should work together in order to achieve goals that one cannot attain. This cooperation ability can be learned while participating in a activities such as musical performance club and sports club. When members work together to make beautiful melodies and pass balls through openings they learn how to ameliorate their problems while respecting others which is great team work.</SI2></BO2> 
 
<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> no one can deny the fact that academic studies give people professional knowledge which makes them experts but there are also a lot of things that cannot be learned through books or lectures.

Some people think that it is more important to teach self-confidence than to teach specialized knowledge, while others do not. <TS>I however, believe that it is not important to teach self-confidence than to teach specialized knowledge.</TS> There are several reasons that I could discuss to support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are most relevant to the topic. First, it is inefficient. Also, people can receive a lot of stress.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> most important reason for my feeling this way is that teaching self-confidence is not efficient because it is not good to success.</MI1> <SI1>Commonly in society, knowledge tends to be important. If people do not have knowledge of his field, they can not get a good job. <EX>Take Tom, for example. He could not get a job long time because he did not have specialized knowledge of his field. It took him over 2 years to get a job.</EX> In constract, it only took 6months to get a job for his friend Tom. This was because Tom knew many things of his filed. This result clearly shows that it is inefficient to teach self-confidence.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> another reason for my thinking this way is that people can receive a lot of stress.</MI2> <SI2>It is difficult to have self-conficence.

A recent article I read on the Korea Herald revealed some interesting findings. <EX>According to the article, a surprising number of people claimed that they had anxiety issues. I found it interesting because this was due to stress from fact that they want to have self-confidence.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>There is a proverb in most of countries, “ Like father, like son” which means children generally resemble their looking as well as personality with their parents. I’ve experienced that people who know my parents well often said that I looked like my parents a lot even though no one told them who I am. <TR>Also,</TR> as a view of education, human being in their childhood are likely to be affected by several factors of their circumstances including family, friends and even where they live very easily. <TR>Among factors,</TR> we can simply assume that parents will be the ones who can spend the longest time together with their kids. <TR>Now,</TR> I can give several examples why parents can be the best teachers of their children with some specific reasons.</IN>

<BO1>My parents started going to church when I was three years old. I could get along with many friends in church and joined a lot of activities which were really interesting to me. After all, I grew up to be a Christian without any questions why I have to go to church and so did my sisters and brother. Though there might be different reason on being Christian, I would rather say that I’ve got used to going to church when I was young because of my parents than I’ve decided to go to church by myself. <TR>Sometimes,</TR> we can see cases that family member has each religion no matter what their parents believe but most of cases, same religion in one family are general cases around us. </BO1>

<BO2>Even not only family’s religion, but we can search for also another example when children are affected by their parents easily. <EX>One of my friend who had lunch with me told me that she would not eat carrot even a little piece. After visiting her place, I realized that why she would not eat carrot at all after seeing what her mom did. Her mom also didn’t use carrot on her cooking and said she didn’t like it because of her mother.</EX> With this simple case, we can imagine that how easily children can look after their parents. No matter how small habit, parents should be careful of showing it to their kids and affection to their habit too. </BO2>

<BO3>While I was living alone, I’ve been cooking with reminding what my mother did on her cooking. <TR>Sometimes,</TR> I even called mother and asked what the recipe was.

Two common ways are gaining from books and gaining from experience. <TS>While learning through experience seems to give a person his own knowledge, know-how, there are several disadvantages in adopting learning from experience over learning through books.<TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> we can get a great deal of knowledge through reading books.</MI1> <SI1>It is limited what a person experiences through his whole life. In contrast, books have all kind of profound knowledge that many people have gotten from their various lives. <EX>Suppose that a student must do his history homework.

702&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>It is not exaggeration to say that education is ‘process of socialization’. When people are young, it is important what they saw and what they heard because it can be dominant behavior in their lives.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly,</TR> parents are the best instructor in linguistics.</MI1> <SI1>Children learn their most languages from their parents.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR> ,what I want to mention as the advantage of working career when they are students is the chance of getting responsibility.</MI1><SI1><TR> In fact,</TR> many teenagers don’t have the responsibility these days.

<BO1><MI1><TR>For one thing,</TR> expanding scholarship encourages students to study hard.</MI1><SI1> There are many students who have to earn their tuition to study continuously in school.

<BO2><MI2><TR>What’s more,</TR> expanding scholarship increase reputation of a school.</MI2> <SI2>To get a scholarship, many applicants with exellent grade apply the school of expanding it.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> I support math and science because they have provided us with a more convenient life.</MI1><SI1> Without scientists' pursuit of knowledge related to math and science, we cannot live the modernized, information world. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> a creative inventor Edison, made a light bulb.

She is not only selling many kinds of cookers but also teaching how to cook with those cookers. My family seldom goes out since she started cooking for us every meal instead of finding a good place to eat or ordering food as many other mom do. My family got used to my mom’s home made cooking as well as didn’t try to go out and buy some food as much as we can. <TS>I know that there are several reasons why some people including my family prefer to eat food at home.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> I sometimes say that I can not even compare food between at home and at restaurant since I get used to eat my mom’s food at home.</MI1><SI1> Not only she is one of best cook but, it is so hard to find tasty food as much as my mom’s food at any place. I know some people who really like to go out and try to eat food at restaurant or food stands around me.

My mom always reminds us not to put many chemical sources when we cook but there are many places, no matter what kind of restaurant it is, to make food with many chemical sources which are not good for health when they cook. I even heard that some people who run food stands or restaurants are not willing to give their food at restaurant to their kids. This gave me very critical reason why I prefer to eat food at home though it sometimes takes long time to make food than I can save much time if I go out. </SI1></BO1>

No matter how busy we are, we need to save some time to spend together such as making food and having tea.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To be concluded,</TR> eating food has been even included into essential one among three categories what human being need for living with house and clothing. This tells us how important eating food for people will be. No matter how long cooking time will take, it is very important to make food at home especially for parents who have child or children. There is a word, “ No food can be made without effort”, which means if we do an effort to make food, it will taste good”. No one can think about nutrition when they make food for their own family. <TR>Also,</TR> children can learn about how to cook as well as what they should do when they have meal together at home.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> another quality that a good parent should have is patience.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In general,</TR> the children are likely to make some mistakes or be resistant to parent’s normal order. <TR>However</TR>, if a son makes a mistake, the parent instantly scold or even hit him severely then situation get worse and can never be recovered. <EX>My parent have never said curse words and used rod to me, instead they just waited till l got to realize my mistake. That attitude gave a great impression to me, and big help to my future life as a parent.</EX> <TR>Therefore,</TR> tolerance is good trait for a good parent.</SI2> </BO2>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, the gifts can make us think of the people who gave those things. </MI2> <SI2>On the whole, we are likely to get the presents from intimate people such as parents, friends, and co-workers, that we can easily remember the special things when we think of the givers. Whereas my father have given me some books, my mother who used to be a musician have offered me concert tickets since my childhood. I never see those books or tickets without thinking of my parents. Thus, we can remember the gifts because those are connected with the givers. </SI2></BO2>

In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?",::,"<IN>People can gain knowledge from books and experience. The knowledge of history or literature is easy to gain from books. However, the knowledge about life is based on experiences. <TS>To me, the experience is more important because wisdom about life is more valuable than physical knowledge from books.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR> of all, people can learn lots of things from books. </MI1> <SI1>Reading books is the best way to learn some special subjects: history, literature and science. When I was a high school student, I read lots of history books. Through them, I learned when my country is established, what our myth is and what Korean War is. In addition this, I read lots of fiction books and it gave me what people give value on. To gain knowledge about fact such as history, reading book is the best way. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>However</TR>, the knowledge from books is good for our common sense but it cannot teach me what friendship is and what life is. </MI2> <SI2>Of course, I read lots of books that treat friendship but it is totally different from the reality. After I broke up with my friends, I realized that what my fault was and how important the patience was. Even though I read patience is important between friends, it less affects than experience. In other words, I agree that experience is the best teacher. Books can explain that when we fight with our friends, how much terrible it is but they cannot explain about my own feeling. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><EX>To compare reading books with experience, suppose that you read about Canada from book and visit Canada. In spite of lots of knowledge from books, one visiting Canada will be more memorable.

Therefore, wild animals have been deprived of their habitats or killed in the course of construction and some unknown beautiful flowers have been driven away. When I was young, I lived in small town which had few buildings and I could listen to the music which birds made. However, after a large shopping mall which occupied much space was built, I could hardly feel the sound that nature made. Thus, an excessive cultivation of land make our planet unpleasant place to live. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, we have made our land polluted much. </MI2> <SI2>As the science and technology develops tremendously, we become accustomed to the modern appliances and cosmetics, such as car, washing machine, and shampoo.

I have been through with both both ways in my studies when I was in university. Some people may believe that it is better to study alone, because they can a lot and concentrate some weak points as they please. <TS>I prefer, however, studying with some friends than studying alone : the group study is efficient, beneficial to the study and fun. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a group study can save time and energy to the studies. </MI1> <SI1>In general, most of the classes include so broad range of studies that we can hardly master all parts of studies for ourselves. However, if we study together with friends, we can distribute the studies into some parts about which each group member know well. Then every member can only focus on some specific parts and all members gather and exchange the data and information. When I was a freshman in university, I took the world history class. The ranges of the exams for that class so wide: from ancient Greek to modern China, I was very interested in old culture, then I made a study group with friends and divided the part to study. As a result of that method, I got A in that class. <TR>Therefore</TR>, a group study is effective method for the studies. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, a group study helps students get good grades. </MI2> <SI2>Studying alone, we tend to be boring and lazy. On the contrary, if we study with others, we are likely to compete each other, thus we can achieve good result in class. Once I studied for the math exam in school with one diligent friend, he studied so hard that he stayed up all night in the library. I was forced to study harder to see him study such like that, otherwise I would have gone to bed or wasted time. So I could get A plus in that class. <TR>Thus</TR> a group study can make us get good result by principle of competition.. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>In addition</TR>, studying together can make us maintain good condition. </MI3> <SI3>When we study alone, we are not likely to manage our study time effectively: we study hard one day staying up all night and then oversleep till afternoon. In that way we can hardly be in good condition when take an exam which is held in the morning. On the other hand, we study with other people, we can take a rest during the study playing basketball and taking to each other. Our study group used to play table tennis when we got sick and tired of studies; after the play, we could easily concentrate on our own studies. So, a group study can provide a good refreshment. </SI3></BO3>

The other was so rich that he enjoyed many outdoor sports. I, who had been indoor person, get to know how to water ski, windsurfing and golf.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, we can correct our drawbacks by making friend with different kinds of persons. </MI2> <SI2>In general, when we are in the similar kinds of persons, we can hardly see our weak points such as bad manner and strange habits.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, in our country, so many people live in small sections; that is, the ratio of people versus area of land is very high. </MI1> <SI1>To illustrate, in Seoul, almost twenty million people are live in there.

833&Some people believe that a college or a university education should be available to all students. Others believe that a higher education should be available to only good students. Discuss each views. Which do you agree with? Why?,::,"<IN>People attend a college or a university for perparing career, new experience as well as increasing knowlege, which means that a university and college is not only for increasing knowledge. <TS>I believe that a college or a university education shold be opened for all students. </TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1>If only good students can attend a college or a university, a college or a university will lose great potential students. </MI1> <SI1>When I was a high school student, one of my friends was not good at grade. She was a very fashionable girl but there was no class for fashion study in my highschool. In order to attend a university or college, students in Korea should pass the enterence exam. She failed the enterence exam and started to work at a fashion model. She made a wonderful success and wanted to study futher. Ten years after graduating high shcool, she could get into a university because of her career. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>However</TR>, if she had been accepted by a university when she graduated the high school, she would have succeed more greatly than now. </MI2> <SI2>At that time, she really wanted to study fashion design. This story shows us that although some students are not good at their grades in high school, they may have potential abilities to study in a particular area. Therefore, a college or a university should be available for all students as long as they want to attend. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Another reason</TR> that a college or a university should be available for all students is that a college or a university provides students with various experiences. </MI3> <SI3>In addition to increasing knowledge, many students who have different backgroud gather and share their cultures at a college or a university.

People have rights to meet and share their culture at a college or a university so they can be accepted whethe they are good students or not. </SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In summary</TR>, I would like to say that students can attend a university or a college as long as they want. While they are attending at higher education, they can decide their mind: quit or continue.

"834&Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Compare these two views. Which view do you agree with? Why? 

",::,"<IN>There is no doubt that playing is important as mush as studying for children because children can learn various things: team work, keeping a rule and admission their lost while they play. <TS>Of course, studying at a school is also important but playing is more essential than it for children. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Schooling is good for learning knowledge: history, math and science and it is necessary for socialization. </MI1> <SI1>Moreover, because schooling is cheaper than private education, attending school is worth. However, in spite of all these benefits, for young children, emotional development is more important than increasing knowledge from books. Most character is built when people are young. Therefore, it is important what young children see, hear and experience. Unfortunately, in Korea, so many parents force their children to study from when they are so young. Parents believe that if their children learn something at a school, they will succeed when they grow up. Some children have no time to play with their friends. They have to go to public school, receive tutoring, piano lessens and painting lessens. They are so tired and get stress. It is natural that they undergo mental problems. It is sad that I hear children’s mental problem on television. I doubt that it is worthy that children learn so many things at the school. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Young children should spent most their time playing with their parents or friends. </MI2> <SI2>I think they can learn lots of things through playing. <EX>For example, because I grew up at a country, I always played outside with my friends. We went to fields in order to grab grasshoppers, frogs and dragonflies. Without reading book or studying at the school, I learned what they eat, when they bear their babies and how they fly. While getting along with my friends, I also learned what friendship is and what teamwork is. I did not take a kindergarten school but I passed an entrance exam for a university. My story shows that it is not always right that young children learn more at the school. Fortunately, my nieces and nephews play a lot because my siblings do not force them to study. I believe that my nieces and nephews can enjoy their lives because they know what is worthy in their lives.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In summary</TR>, I strongly suggest that the older generation do not push young children to study from their young. Happiness is not from knowledge but from relationship among people.

It is the same in educational point of view. Many useful tools like computers or

Therefore a teacher can create the human power. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, the more teachers, the better of the quality of education. </MI2> <SI2>Because of the overpopulation, most of the schools in my community are overcrowded with students. If more teacher are to hired in the schools, the ratio between the students and teachers becomes considerably low.

When I was in middle school, my class had 60 students who had only to receive the lessons from teachers, On the contrary, my high school had only 35 students in each class, so I could really enjoy the school life.

release dirty waters and dirty airs from chimneys. It can cause water pollution and air 
pollution to the community. Furthermore, a large number of people and cars from other

Some peoples may choose the sense of humor, because it can soften the mood between a boss and employees. Others may select the diligence, because it can benefit the business. <TS>I prefer, however, to choose two personalities : not having favoritism and the willingness to accept the responsibility, because those traits can harmonize the boss and workers well. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a good boss should not have favoritism. </MI1> <SI1>If the boss exclusively likes a certain employee and gives him or her some benefit, then the unity of whole workplace will collapse. We can witness same situation in schools : when some teachers have affection with only specific student, so called teacher’s pet, the harmony between teachers and students will break up. Once I heard the news, some salesman who had been received partial love from his boss, got to be isolated by other workers so utterly, that he committed suicide. As that incident vividly illustrates, a good boss should treat the employees equally. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, a good boss should have a mind to take responsibility willingly. </MI2> <SI2>In general, whereas a leader in a group may have many privileges and rights, he or she has many duties and obligations about the work. In addition, to be a good supervisor, he or she must get to the work early and clean up the area where he or she works voluntarily. There was news report that some small clothing company could get out of nearly being bankruptcy during the depression owing to the unity : the boss poured his own properties into the business and the employees determined that they would not get paid until the business could strive. Therefore, the responsibility that a boss should work not only for himself or herself, but also the work members is pivotal traits for a good boss. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, no one denies the fact that there are other vital elements to be a good boss. However, I would rather choose those two traits : being impartial and the sense of responsibility, because it can create the sense of unity in the workplace. Above all, a leader should demonstrates those qualities before he or she demands others to do so. </CO>

847&Some people believe that a college or a university education should be available to all students. Others believe that a higher education should be available to only good students. Discuss each views. Which do you agree with? Why?,::,"<IN>Recently, many universities and colleges have accepted students who show special ability in specific fields like literature, math, science, statement, or even paduk. <TS>I think this current tendency is quite desirable, and I have a opinion that even students who don't have good grades or who are not smart should be accepted to college as well if they are talented or enthusiastic in a certain field.</TS> Here are two reasons to support my opinion. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, students who have not been successful in school work also have the right to be educated, and information or knowledge should be distributed to everyone in society. </MI1> <SI1>If college keeps on accepting only smart and well-educated students, students from uneducated families can not benefit from higher education. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, students who haven't distinguished themselves until highschool can find out and enhance their potential ability after they get into university. </MI2> <SI2>Usually in high schools in Korea, capacity of students is measured by total sum of variety of subjects. Thus, there are very few opportunity to figure out their talent or ability in a specific field. <EX>For example, I have had a friend from high school who were very talented in writing poems, but she wasn't regarded as a good student, because she was not good at math and science. Nevertheless, she got into university through special entrance system for students who are good at literature and writing, and now she is applying herself in writing poems and also winning many awards.</EX></SI2></BO2>",::,3,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,2,::,,//
848&Think of the most interesting class you have ever taken. Why did you enjoy this class so much? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.,::,"<IN>I have been attending a lot of classes for several years. There were some boring classes, also some interesting classes. I enjoyed my English class which I took at university. It was different from a boring high school English class. <TS>Because university English class was in English, non-traditional class, I liked this class and learned many things. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, university English class which was processing in English gave me more advantages than high school English class which was in Korean. </MI1> <SI1>Because not only the text book but also teacher's words were English, I had to learn all grammar and memorize all examples in English. Memorizing in English gave me more knowledge of vocabulary and phrase. The high school English class which was in Korean couldn't give me a clear sense of English grammar because the text book was translated in Korean which had not exact meaning of English </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, the university English class was non- traditional class, I had a chance to present my opinion. </MI2> <SI2>In high school, it was traditional class which made student passive. Even though I had a good idea, I couldn't talk to my teacher. He thought that students must follow the teacher's opinion. However, in university English class, I could speak my opinion and if it was good, the teacher would accept it. It made me confident. Also, I had to speak in English in this class, I could improve my English speaking skill. </SI2></BO2>

<CO>I have learned a great amount of knowledge in many classes. However, there are few classes which give me real advantages. I am interested in class which can give me real knowledge to use in the future. The university English class makes me more confident, give me more freedom to speak my opinion, and know many things about English. Therefore, I enjoyed learning in English in non-traditional class like my university English class. </CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we can get a lot of money by owning a business. </MI1> <SI1>In general, if we have a house, we have to pay a lot for the house from income tax, maintenance cost to the insurance cost. In addition, the value of the house is likely to decrease years after years. On the contrary, if we have own businesses and take good care of managing them, we can earn considerable money except for the essential cost. Recently, my father who retired from some manufacture company started to sell accessories in a small shop, although at first some money had to pay, the shop now is crowded with many young people spending much money. As that case illustrates, owning a business can give us a big fortune. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, purchasing a business can be fun. </MI2> <SI2>As a rule, owning and managing a house is a great stressful activity. We should always concern about the security from theft or fire. On the hand, when we get businesses, we can enjoy our life working in the business. It has been known to be true that the people who have jobs are likely to live longer that those who do not. My grandparent still have their own business which is small bakery shop, although they are over seventies, they are healthy and satisfied with everything. Thus, getting a business can be a enjoyable activity. </SI2></BO2>

<TS>I stongly agree with games are not important any less adult than the child. This opinion dues to the two reasons : provinding refreshment , improvement of social realationship.</TS> </IN>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, games devolop social relationships. </MI2> <SI2>
Not only child, but also adult has a limit relationship; collegues are usually regarded only as co-workers so between them, there are lack of initativeness.

<CO>There are so many games one can have in every day life. Through game one can refresh oneself certainly and have a chance to improve relationships of other people. That will enable adults to enjoy their life. For this reasons, it is natural that importance of games is applied to adults as much as children. </CO>

Some people will say it will cause adverse effect on their community since it will bring environment pollution and traffic congestion. On the other hand, others will say that it will make positive effect on their community since it will develope their community and provide more jobs to people who have no job. <TS>In my opinion, I prefer the latter idea because my town is not developed yet. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>In the first place</TR>, a large factory will cause disadvantages to the community since it will cause environment contamination and traffic jam. </MI1> <SI1>If a large factory is built, it will release dirty waters and dirty airs from chimneys. It can cause water pollution and air pollution to the community. Furthermore, a large number of people and cars from other community will come to the town. So there will be serious traffic jam. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the other hand</TR>, a large factory will cause advantages since it will develope our town and provide new job to people from the factory. </MI2> <SI2>If a new factory is built in our

852&Some people think that the family is the most important influence on young adults. Other people think that friends are the most important influence on young adults. Which view do you agree with? Use examples to support your positions.,::,"<IN>As people grow up, they have contacted many persons from parents to university professors. Some people may say that young adults, between 16 to 19 years old, are more influenced by the family, because they are still young. <TS>However, I think, high teens are more affected by friends, since they spend most of their time together and develop their characters after the friends. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, young adults spend a lot of time with friends. </MI1> <SI1>In general, as the society become complicated and busy, the family members can hardly have time to get together except for the dinner time. On the contrary, young people can meet their friend almost in any place from school, library, playground, and even cafeteria where they work for part time job. When I was in high school, I spent most of the time, that is except for the sleeping time, with some friends studying, playing and going on movies. Therefore, through spending a huge amount of time with friends, the young adults are likely to be influence by them. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, friends can make a good model for young people. </MI2> <SI2>As a rule, when people are still young, they imitate their parents and determine their future after them. However, as they grow older and they become to know some friends, the situation changes. One may follow some friends who are clever and honest and make them his or her future model. Once there was a friend who was so diligent and studied hard that he always got the highest grade in my class. I tried to make an effort not to fall behind him, therefore I could graduate the high school with honors with him. As that case shows, young adults can develop good quality owing to friends. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, some people may argue that young adults are still more in the surrounding of the family, so that the friends can make little influence on them. I think, however, friends are the most influential factors to the young adults, for their frequent contacts and the possibility of good examples. </CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, schools can make time for introduction and information about the schools and students. </MI1> <SI1>In general, students who come from other schools do not feel comfortable at new surroundings. If they have time for getting the information of the schools and introducing themselves to the students they can easily accustomed to the new school life. I have been through many different schools, because my father have been public school teacher.

As that case illustrates, schools can help the newly moved students providing the communication time. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, schools need to take care of new students on and on. </MI2> <SI2>As a rule, since the newcomers have unique taste due to the different regional background, they tend to be despised or isolated by other students.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we can have energy in the dinning room. </MI1> <SI1>In general, above all, people should eat for survival. Without eating something people can never do anything.

Since childhood, I make it a rule to have breakfast in the dinning room at home with parents.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, literacy program can assist the illiterate to adapt themselves to civilized society. </MI1> <SI1>In general, unlike the old culture, almost all media are written in letters.

When children are young, what they see, what they hear and what they feel greatly affect building their personality.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, I think that communication between children and parents is most important to understand one another. </MI1> <SI1>Many parents tend to ignore children's opinion.

That adults think nothing can be what children think very important. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Children cannot act like adults but many parents expect their children to act mutually although they are still young. </MI2> <SI2>Children need a time to be mutual. Everybody knows that children' spoiling clothes is natural but many parents cannot put up with it and yell and scream to their children. Sometimes, parents give their children a hard time not because of children's faults but because of their anger. If parents want to teach their children carefulness, they should speak to their children in a voice of sweet reason. Otherwise, children cannot understand why they receive a hard time and do not reflect on their conduct. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>Children are not parent's possession. </MI3> <SI3>In Korea, many parents push their children into their expectations. My father wanted to be a doctor but he could make it because my grandfather passed away when my father was a high school student. Unfortunately, my father push my first brother into a doctor and they fought a lot. Children have rights to do whatever they want to do as long as it is wholesome. Parents can give an advice but should not push their children. </SI3></BO3>

861&Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>Teachers are very important because they affect students in various ways. Thus, teachers should have some good qualites: fairness, honesty, patience and good teaching skill.  The principal can evaluate teachers but it is students who exactly know who is the best teacher. <TS>I agree that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, we can say that teaching skill is one of the most important qualites of teachers. </MI1> <SI1>Although a teacher is intellegent, if he or she has no skill to teach, students would lose their interst in studying. Students know who has a good skill because they receive teaching from teachers. When I was a high school student, our history teacher looked know everything but he spoke too quietly to hear and he just read books. All students were sleeping at the history class. I was not sure if the principal knew this or not but I was sure that all my classmates disliked his teaching style. If we had participated the evaluation of teacher, our history teacher have tried to change his teaching style. The advice from students would be the best way for teachers to know if they are doing well or not. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, teachers are advisors as well. </MI2> <SI2>Whenever students have problems, they can meet teachers. If teachers avoid this, students hardly solve their problems. when I was a middle school student, one of my classmates ran away. She didn't show up at school for more than 4 days. My teacher tried to find her and finally she found her at a shelter. My teacher listened to her story and gave her an advice. After that, my teacher send my classmate a letter frequently. I think she was a really good teacher. Although she are not excellect at teaching, I would like to chose her as the best teacher if schools give me a chance to evaluate teachers. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In summary</TR>, I think students know teachers more than anyone. Of cousre, it is risk that only students evaluate their teachers because of immature or bias.

Therefore, I disagree with that statement. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, to succeed in life, people should be satisfied with the life. </MI1> <SI1>If people making a lot of money never contend with what they have and what they do, then the life becomes miserable. On the contrary, people who earn a little money, but are satisfied with the present position, can lead a better life than those greedy people. My grandfather, who is 70 years old and does not have much money, run a small bakery shop. He enjoys cooking and making bread so much that I never enter that shop without seeing a smile on his face. As that smile vividly shows, people should be happy with the work and life to lead a successful life. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, people should be earnest in their works. </MI2> <SI2>In general, people consider their jobs to be just necessary evil, so they are likely to passive in doing work. On the other hand, some people should make great efforts to do and carry their works. We can witness that many famous painters made a marvelous masterpiece after numerous trials and errors. Once I saw my grandfather make a cake for my birthday party, he was so absorbed in his work that I could not even talk to him. Thus, people who are devoted to their works deserve to be called successful. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, there can be no denying the fact that the wealth is one criterion of success and without a reasonable money people can not live a plentiful life. However, I think, besides money, two mentioned conditions : satisfaction with the work and earnestness to the work, are necessary for successful people. If people should be called really successful in life, they should have those material, mental and spiritual prerequisites.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, having the opportunity of communication is a matter of the attitude which people have on life. </MI1> <SI1>Some outgoing person may contact many people and have frequent dialogue with them.

My family members enjoy watching television almost everyday from action movies to baseball games. However, among them my mother and my brother likes to talk to siblings but other members do not. As that example illustrates, television has little effect on the communication among people . </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, television can create new themes of communication. </MI2> <SI2>In general, almost all people watch something no matter what program may be on television everyday and they tend to tell other people something on television what they saw and what captured their mind. Therefore because of the television, they are more likely to converse with others. My office, which is made up of 10 people who have different taste, is usually full of dialogues about the television program aired previous day such as sex scandals between celebrities and talk show about complicated financial problem around country. <TR>Thus</TR>, through television, people can have more chance to communicate each other. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, there can be no denying the fact that as the television program develops, the possibility of watching television is likely to increase.

The first immigrant Korean enjoys the Chinese New Year although they have been lived in Canada for a long time.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Above all</TR>, person to person contact in complaint can lessen the possibility of misunderstanding. </MI1> <SI1>In general, people are likely to have outdated or even wrong information about products or services which they want to have, so that they can be upset or angry with the price or the quality.

When I brought it home and tested something, I found that it did not have some functions. Then I ran to the shop and told the shop owner about that, but soon I realized that the camcorder that I saw in the catalogue was different one during the conversation with him.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the high school is not able to give those lessons efficiently. </MI1> <SI1>In general, the high school provides a huge number of so called essential classes, such as mathematics, world history, and biology etc. So, there is hardly ever room for other classes. Besides they can not hire teachers who have excellent skills and careers, due to the lack of limited money. In such a poor circumstances, students are not likely to get good art and music classes. I could hardly recall good memory of art and music class which one teacher took chare in and gave only two written tests a year. Therefore they can hardly get good lessons of those classes in high school for lack of the prerequisites. </SI1></BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, there exist other opportunities for such classes. </MI2> <SI2>Students who are interested in art and music can learn and practice lessons and skills outside schools.

My sister, who is now professional pianist, had to get lessons from university student who majored in music during the high school year and went into the university to major in music. As that case vividly indicates, students in high school can get such lessons better by other ways. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In summary</TR>, in principle, it is preferable for all students who have aptitude for music and art to have such classes in high school. In practice, however, for the lack of good condition of those classes and the existence of good alternative of high school classes, I would rather recommend that it is not necessary for all of them to have those classes. Students can be good musicians or painters by means of lessons outside high schools. </CO>

879&Some high school require all students to wear school uniforms. Other high schools permit students to decide what to wear to school. Which of these two school policies do you think is better? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.,::,"<IN>It has long been argued in our country that whether we should allow high school students to wear their own clothes or not. Some people may say that it is better for the students to choose to put on their own clothes, because they can carry out the school life freely with convenient clothes. <TS>I think, however, demanding them to wear uniforms is the preferable choice, since it can help them concentrate on their studies and keep in harmony with other students. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, requiring the students in high school to wear uniforms is beneficial to the study. </MI1> <SI1>In general, as in the age of 16 to 19, the students tend to be sensitive to others’ behavior or outer appearance. If they are allowed to choose their own clothes, then they are likely to select more good looking and expensive clothes because of jealousy. On the contrary, when they have to wear same clothes, they need not waste energy on such trivial things. I have been through with those two policies. When I had on uniform, I easily came to devote myself to the study. As that case vividly illustrates, school uniforms can improve the study. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, school uniforms can contribute the harmony of the schools. </MI2> <SI2>As a rule, when the students have on different kinds of clothes, the sense of the unity is likely to collapse, because of the tendency that people evaluate people by their outer appearance. On the other hand, when all the member of schools put on the same clothes, they can easily get to the harmony. Besides, teachers are likely to evaluate the students only by their grades or behavior. When I chose my own clothes in high school, the students tended to divided some groups by their clothes, so there was some unpleasant mood in the classroom. Thus, school uniforms can help the schools to unite their member closely together. </SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the zoo can provide us live lessons. </MI1> <SI1>In general, although we can encounter a large number of animals through encyclopedia and documentary television program, we can hardly feel the real aspects of living things.

According to the position or mood of the readers, the whole story can be translated totally different.

So, current working environment demand for new change in employment. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, we can no longer keep the traditional employment system in the perspective of business profit. </MI2> <SI2>In old days when the family members had same jobs, the sense of lifetime employment was possible. However, these days most of the people get a variety of jobs and the owner of the company are likely to think highly of his or her profit. Therefore, when some workers showed inability of work or there is urgent need for decreasing the cost of the company, some employers have to leave the work. My father had to find a new job, according to the downsizing policy of the company. As that case vividly show, the pursuit of the gain in business makes it almost impossible to get lifetime employment. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, in principle, it is good for all workers to carry out their workers as long as possible.

When it comes to using lands, some people may argue that it is better for land to be used for building houses and factories, because there are urgent need for them. <TS>I think, however, it is preferable for land to be untouched, since uncultivated land is beneficial to both the community and wild life. </TS></IN>

Thus, there is hardly any need to build such buildings these days. Besides, our life has become more unhealthy and unhappy with those building, since they use a lot of energy and release a large amount of harmful liquid and gases. If the land is to be undeveloped, then those nuisances can not happen any more. Then we can take a walk with family members or play some sports with friends over the land, Therefore, preserving the land is beneficial to the community. </SI1></BO1>

However, after new apartment complex and some shopping mall were set up on that land, I could no longer witness that gorgeous scenery. If some lands are to be undeveloped, a large number of animals can live and beautiful plants can grow on them. Therefore, uncultivated lands can be a excellent home to the wild life. </SI2></BO2>

Now the time has arrived when we think our planet as the common place where human beings and wild life can live together. </CO>

896&Some people trust their first impressions about a person’s character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. Other people do not judge a person’s character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. Compare these two attitudes. Which attitude do you agree with? Support your choice with specific examples.,::,"<IN>It has been known to be true that we encounter a lot of persons who have different traits. When it comes to the evaluation of persons, some people may say they can catch the personality, because outer appearance is a vital indication of what a person is. <TS>However, I would rather oppose that opinion, because people have their own preference and they can hardly understand the person’s real character in such a short time. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, people’s prejudice can lead people to make a false understanding of the person. </MI1> <SI1>In general, according to the diversity of the society, people tend to have their own unique tastes about person. Some outgoing persons are likely to have a good opinion about a person who tells frank opinion openly. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, some reserved people are fond of a person who show polite and quiet manner. Thus according to their trait, people have completely different evaluation about the same person. Once I introduced my girlfriend who liked taking to others to my family members, to my surprise, the response was divide into two groups : my parents thought her rater rude but my sister consider her very frank. As that case vividly shows, the evaluation of the first impression is a matter of one’s preference. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, people can catch only small portions of the character of a person. </MI2> <SI2>As a rule, when meeting others, people tend to behave more cautiously that they really are, since they are not familiar with them and they do not want to make trouble with him by showing their real personality. Therefore, people can hardly know what the person is at first meeting. As in my case, although I really like taking to other people about my concerns, I never express those topics to a person who I meet for the first time, so even my girlfriend though me as a reserved person at first. So, the first impression means just initial indication of a person and that is all. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, there are, of course, some people who show their real characters from the beginning to the end. Nevertheless, on the whole, the first impression has such a possibility of misleading that we should not overestimate and depend on it when we judge a person.

904&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN>Television is one of the great inventions. People can’t imagine their lives without television. Nowadays, there is a lot of media such as newspaper, magazine and Internet. <TS>But TV is the best way to communicate among friends and family.</TS> We can know what’s going on the world. It makes us discuss and exchange each opinion about one issue or topic. TV promotes to communicate among friends and family.</IN>

<BO1><MI1>I’ll give you how television helps people communicate each other. </MI1> <SI1>The first of examples, in family, there is very funny and interesting TV program which every family is interested in. while the program is showing, all family approach to TV. Naturally, they can talk about this program and communication can develop toward how family members spend their time today. TV can be a good motivation to start to communicate among family. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second of all</TR>, there are many educational programs and news for adults and students. </MI2> <SI2>In school and at home, family or friends can discuss about today’s new issue. All issues have two sides, disagree or agree. Some people agree to some issue and other people disagree to the issue. Watching educational programs such as documentary programs is good method to develop students’ thought when they communicate between friends and teachers. <TR>Therefore,</TR> TV helps people communicate more and more. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>The last of examples how TV makes communication among people, in my country, Korea, there was some popular soap drama that was very famous among all age groups. </MI3> <SI3>When this drama was showing, just few people were walking around street such as downtown streets or some bars. As soon as people finished their works, they came back to their home. <TR>At that time,</TR> in the street there was no traffic and no crimes no drunken people. Because they spent time at home with their families and family can feel love each other. I confirm that TV can tie to family in love. So family can have enough time to communicate by the soap TV drama. </SI3></BO3>  

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, TV has made more communication among friends and family. If we don’t have TV, we are very difficult to find the topic in a group. TV makes people’s relationships more naturally by communication. TV gives us more opportunity to communicate each other. </CO>

From this point, I can guess why I need friends and what the friends must be like. <TS>So, I agree that it is better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances, although others think it oppositely. A few close friends can enhance the quality of relationship better, and reduces stress to know new people. <TR>In addition,</TR> making a few friends can be more efficient considering available time and efforts.</TS> </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the quality of relationship is much higher in case of making a few friends. </MI1> <SI1>We can know each other's character and trait pretty well. So, we can easily understand how he or she feels and behave. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when my friend is in the trouble, I can give best advice for himself because I understand him.</EX> By this process, we are able to build more and more strong relationships. It will eventually strengthen our relationship. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, it will be more stress especially for me to meet various people. </MI2> <SI2>Because I am introvert, it is not easy to meet new people very often. <TR>In my case,</TR> having a few friends and stronger relationship is more comfortable. Whenever I try to make a lot acquaintances, it really gives me stress. <EX>For example, I used to become nervous whenever I meet new people at first. And, I am concerned even about something like appearance. I don't want to imagine that I has to meet lot of new acquaintances.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Last</TR>, having a few buddy is more efficient in term of time investment. </MI3> <SI3>If I try to make lots of acquaintance, it will take much time. <TR>In addition</TR>, the relationship is maybe not so strong. It is because we can not share much time together. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I attended some class in university, I decided to memorize and know the face of all students.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, participating in the field related to the subject is more effective way to motivate students. </MI1> <SI1>The rationale behind this is that it is easier for students to understand something by working in the real world. <TR>In other words,</TR> It is a better way to act than just listen. <EX>The best example of this is seen from when I participated in internship programs. I major in Mathematics. <TR>In the class,</TR> professor said that Math is utilized in the field of insurance and how it is used. <TR>At that time,</TR> I do not interest in that field. <TR>However</TR>, after I worked in Samsung Insurance as an intern, I was very impressed in Math.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, ability of teacher is one of the most important factors to help students be fascinated with the subject. </MI2> <SI2>This is because students are likely to be interested in overall study as well as the subject how they like their teacher. <EX><TR>To illustrate this point,</TR> Helen Keller, who could neither hear nor see, was hard to get to study.<TR> At first</TR>, Helen Keller was likely to give up easily and she thought that she was so crippled that she could not learn anything. <TR>However,</TR> Anne Sullivan, who is her private teacher, struggled to divert her attitude from negatives.

Without the teacher`s passion, it would be impossible for Helen Keller to begin learning something</EX>. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In a nutshell</TR>, It is good way to teach students how the subject is used. <TR>However</TR>, I strongly argue that firsthand experience and efforts of teachers is more imperative. My reason, as above stated, could encourage students to be intrigued in the subject as well as study. </CO>

933&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Children should wait to begin learning a foreign language until they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN>Many people usually refer nowadays as “global generation”, which represent that whole world is connected to one. In this situation, we can say knowing a foreign language is the most important and strong weapon in this society. <TS>I, <TR>however</TR>, believe children should not begin learning a foreign language until they start school for some reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, learning first language is more important for children because it provides a basic understanding of a language. </MI1> <SI1>When they learn and study their first language, they get to know grammar, especially the structure of sentences. In this way, they would feel easier when they start learning a second language at school. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, A student felt more confident on second language before going to school while B student did not. After first semester, B student got better result on Spanish class than result A student had. The school teacher clarified on this result by saying that B student could get better grade than A student since B student has had better understanding of the structure of language. According to this school teacher, the understanding of basic element in language is more important than starting studying foreign language earlier.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, I believe it is not late for them to start learning foreign language after going to school. </MI2> <SI2>Many people say the younger ones are the better at learning a foreign language. According to one article from Joseon, there is no big difference between the one who have already started learning it before school and another who have just started. They continued stating that both children are still at the same level in foreign language skills and beginning point does not really matter on their ability to speak foreign language for those younger ones. <TR>For this reason,</TR> I do not think children should start learning a foreign language before school starts. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To summarize</TR>, understanding the basis grammar of their first language is the most important thing for children, and it is not late to start learning it after school starts.

<BO1><MI1></TR>To begin with</TR>, government and university can not force to students to take history classes All students have a right that they choose what they want to take. </MI1> <SI1>Even if they take the history classes due to requirement, they may not concentrate the class. When students choose subjects that they want to take, they can motivate from learning what they really want to know. According to a study conducted by a team of researchers at Harvard University, students are unable to study hard when they are forced by taking requirement classes. The study shows that students put in more effort when placed determining decision themselves. As far as choosing subject is concerned, it would never forced.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, planning has a limitation. </MI1> <SI1>That is, there is no perfect planning in this fast changing society. <TR>Thus</TR>, people had better be creative to make a best solution. A famous scholar Nassim Taleb insists that human's reason and knowledge has a clear limitation. <EX>He shows one example. Many economists have made numerous economic models, which were for the purpose of predicting future correctly. <TR>In other words</TR>, by planning economic policies carefully based on their economic models, they thought it would help society to be a better place. <TR>However</TR>, it was wrong. In 2008, financial crises hit the world's economy severely. None of the models predicted that there could be economic crisis in the near future.</EX> Taleb refers to this situation as 'Black swan.' The term 'black swan' means that no one can precisely predict what will happen in the future. <TR>In contrast</TR>, being creative and giving spontaneous solutions or improvisations can be a excellent way to overcome many difficulties. <EX>In the economic crises, whereas economists did not respond to difficulties effectively, investors who were ingenuous and had no long-term planning adapted themselves to the changing circumstances and made huge profits.</EX> From this example, I can conclude that being creative is a better choice. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, many successes can be derived from creativity, not from planning. </MI2> <SI2>Although planning carefully gives stability to people, it cannot make huge success. Creativity is different. By being ingenious, people are able to make creative solution and attract many attentions, which leads to great success. <EX>Steve Jobs is a clear example. When he launched his company Apple and produced cell-phone, all cell-phone making entrepreneurs focused on just phone technology. <TR>However</TR>, he thought differently and adopted many new features to his iPhone, from internet technology to fashionable design. Due to satisfying customer's expectations, Apple now becomes a No.1 company in the world. If he had just followed a traditional way and planned his company's strategy equivalent to other companies, he could not have succeeded like today.</EX> </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, I firmly believe that being creative should be emphasized as much as possible, because it is a new solution to succeed in the modern society. Encouraging people to be ingenious should not be disregarded as absurdity or irrationality. </CO>

Exams encourage students to learn.,::,"<IN>Some people maintain that exams are unnecessary, as it only causes stress. <TR>In this sense,</TR> a few schools already discarded policy to take a test. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this statement and believe exams encourage students to learn.</TS> My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, exams motivate students to learn as it gives students the arranged amount of study until the scheduled date. </MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words, exams induce students to look back at their books which would be out of their eyes if it were not for the exams. No test makes students loose, since they think they all know about the contents, just because they had the class before and it disencourages them to study. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, I was in a high school where the policy was to not to take a test to relieve stress of students. It really had an impact for students including me, and I didn't study at all. I didn't have any incentive to do study. <TR>In contrast</TR>, after realizing that students' intellectual ability is going down, the school modified the policy to take a test every semester. Then students initiated studying, also accepting the evaluation that their ability was deteriorated.</EX> </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, exams foster competence amongst students which would encourage students to study. </MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it another way,</TR> students care about the test score and their rivals. <TR>Thus</TR>, when a student see that his or her rival studying in free time, it is likely that the student would also study, not to be loitered. An analogous example studied in Seould National University shows this precisely. In marathon, runners tend to form groups sepereately and the groups make runners to keep up with their rivals. They do not go faster or slower than the group members, but they just follow them. Even though it's speed is faster than one runner can afford, the runner follows the group and get a better result because of his mind not to be defeated by his rivals. This shows how competence benefits each person, and can be samely applied to student who has his own rival on studying. </SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it is hard for famous celebrities and sport players to keep their own privacy. </MI1> <SI1>Since they are famous and well-known, it is not easy for them to go outside and do whatever they want to do since their fans are looking at them. <TR>Plus,</TR> these days people quickly find out where the famous movie star is or what he or she is doing right now by tweeter and facebook.<TR> As a result</TR>, the celebrities and famous athletes often look for the place where they can keep their privacy, and these places cost usually much higher than any other regular places. <TR>In this manner</TR>, they spend much money on any activities that they do outside, <TR>thus</TR> it is reasonable to earn higher salary than other normal people do.<EX><TR> For example,</TR> according to one article about one famous figure skating star, Yuna Kim, she replied that she has spent much money eating her supper at some places where there are no many people visit after she won the gold medal in 2010 Vancouver Olyimpics and became famous. When she was in one restaurant, many people noticed her and kept asking for signature and pictures while eating. After this event, she starts finding places that not many people visit. She continues saying that these places usually cost much higher than any other places. Not only Yuna Kim, but many other famous ones deserve to earn much money as they spend much money than common people. </EX></SI1></BO1>


<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, many celebrities or famous sport players invest on themselves. </MI2> <SI2>As they are well-known, they need to prepare and keep improving their ability or skills on whatever they do. <TR>In this way</TR>, they often spent more time on their practice and spent more money as well for the equipment or clothing. <TR>Thus</TR>, it is right to earn more money for these people. One city in South Korea has the most popular and famous baseball team, Lotte Giants. Many players start gathering for practice 6 hours before the actual game starts.

<BO1><MI1></TR>To begin with</TR>, companies should invest in motivating the employees for better efficiency. </MI1> <SI1>Enhancing the skills of employees are valuable, and high competency of employees are desired. <TR>However</TR>, no highly skilled employee can beat a motivated one in terms of efficiency and eagerness to get the work done. Einstein once said, genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. I firmly believe that work efficacy is indeed the ultimate objectives of the companies in order to make high profit. Experts have discovered that these welfare policies have a strong correlation with the efficiency of employees. Motivating the employees by making the workplace pleasant and comfortable has a strong impact on the output given by employees. Many trend-setting companies have adopted many policies such as flexible work hours, and invested in facilities such as in-house gyms, billiards, table tennis, yoga, therapist, etc. to make the office more employee friendly and to help relieve the stress of its employees</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, relationship between employees are important when working towards a single goal. </MI2> <SI2>While many employees feel that their colleagues and peers are potential rivals, we cannot deny the fact that companies needs its employees to cooperate and work as a team. By investing in activities that build and strengthen relationship between employees, companies can expect the employees to collaborate from everyday tasks to billion-dollar projects. <EX>From my personal experience, my company provides a myriad of activities that bond employees, and ultimately enables employees to work seamlessly as a team. By participating in such activities, camaraderie inevitably began to build, and this extended to real work too. </EX>I have always found it much easier to accost a colleague and make work-related request when I am well acquainted with him or her. Companies are oriented towards a single goal, and cooperation among employees is crucial as this would not only get the work done, but create a synergy effect that elevates the standard of work. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In a nutshell</TR>, while an employee skill set is a desired trait, the impact of motivation and employee cooperation far outweigh the number of advantages provided to the company. <TR>In this regard</TR>, I strongly feel that companies should invest in aspects other than employee training. </CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, improved public transportation systems can boost economy.</MI1> <SI1>In the past, people are tired of going to their companies because the companies are far away from people’s house. So, most people got a job near their house regardless of people’s desires. But, these days, as public transportation systems have improved, people can commute on their companies far from their house by using public transportation. According to a study of the researchers by Harvard University in 2009, the employment rate in Seoul had exponentially increased and the study found out that most people of employees resided in the rural areas far from their companies because of construction of subway system. This shows that improved public transportation play a significant role in creating job openings. </SI1></BO1>

We can agree that the primary reason of writing a book is to transfer its content to readers and make them understood. <TR>In addition</TR>, knowledge gained from books is a efficient and effective to learn many things within a short period of time. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, just for a couple of days, people can learn many aspects about Japan even if they do not visit it.</EX> </IN>

This is because people remember and use knowledge not only by using brain, but also using all senses. It means that people usually use all five senses, such as eye, nose, or ear to get knowledge derived from experience. The term 'implicit knowledge' clearly shows this point. It helps people embody their experienced knowledge to their memory and body, leading them to remember knowledge as long as possible. Many studies reveal that knowledge obtained from experience endure longer time to people due to the reasons addressed above. <TR>For instance,</TR> although people do not get skills how to drive a car by book, they can usually do well because of their knowledge gained by using all senses, from seeing to motion. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, a large number of requisite knowledge in a daily life is knowledge from experience, not from specialized books. </MI2> <SI2>I agree that mathematics skills, principle of physics and any subject which is complicating are crucial for improvement of human society. <TR>However</TR>, this is just for a few specialized scholars. I firmly support the idea that many basic skills from experience in a routine life is more important to common people.

At that time, I read lots of tennis related magazines. <TR>However</TR>, to know from books is one thing and to play tennis is another.

"956&Nowadays, students pay more attention to politics than in the past.",::,"<IN>It is often said that today's students are less interested in politics than in the past. <TS><TR>On the other hand,</TR> I believe that they pay more attention to politics than in the past because politics can enable students to cope with their stress and succeed in career.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, having idea on politics allows students to learn to deal with stress. </MI1> <SI1>
This is due to the fact that learning politics can distract students from their worries and stress related to understanding their friends. <TR>Therefore,</TR> this informative and practical method may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as to recharge energy. <EX>According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, there was a difference between two groups of high school students in managing their pressure on making new friends. Students in Group A who took politics in middle school and knew how to be a friend with new people were more satisfied with their school lives than those in Group B who did not learn about politics at all. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, those in Group B had a hard time to adjust to new school because they did not have a friend and felt lonely.</EX> This implies that the knowledge with politics serves as a safe and effective way to let out frustration and stress in relation with others. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> political skill has a direct correlation with success in career. </MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that students with good political skill make good suggestions, leading to the growth of company. <TR>Moreover</TR>, as modern society has become competitive and politically diverse, today's job markets require job candidates with such qualities. According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2010, the employment interview was the most important component in hiring practice, taking up to more than 70 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at the applicant's knowledge and skills of politics, mostly related to interacting with others. This implies that having good idea on politics is a secure way for students to prepare for their future. </SI2></BO2>

This is because people earn more leisure time than before and many jobs today are related to entertainment.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, since an available leisure time has been increased, people today have had enough time to enjoy themselves. </MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific,</TR> as science and technology have been developed drastically, factories and offices have various kinds of automatic systems so companies don't require their employees to work much time. <TR>To illustrate this</TR>, a 2012 report conducted by the Ministry of Labor in Korea shows that the annual working hours of an ordinary worker in 2010 is 3000 hours, while it was 3600 hours in 1960. The report also claims that due to the increase of a leisure time, people spend much time and money on things related to entertainment businesses such as watching movies, traveling, playing sports, and so on. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of the statement above</TR>, today in many cases, things that a person should do correspond to things that a person enjoys, which looks like that people just enjoy their lives without doing nothing important. </MI2> <SI2><TR>Specifically</TR>, as society evolves from uniform and hierarchical structure to individual and various one, individuals become freer of searching for jobs. It means that there are a variety of jobs out there and many of them coincide with entertainment. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my uncles, a skin scuba diver, spends most of his time on oceans.

<BO1><MI1>Looking back to Korea’s traditional community, a value that dominated our culture was collaboration and staying in unison with neighbors. </MI1> <SI1>With the emergence of a new idea, individualism, this firmly held belief was pushed out our way and people quickly took to the idea of living individual lives, less caring about others’ point of view or conventional values imposed upon them by society. The new phenomena seemed novel, since it freed people from having to work for the good of “the whole society” instead of pursuing personal interests. The enforcement of individual rights which was intended to make our society better, nonetheless, has backfired in that it has led to lack of empathy for others and the rampancy of apathy. </SI1></BO1>

The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out but, <TR>as far as I am concerned</TR>, I prefer to eat out.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. </IN>

<BO1><MI1></TR>To begin with</TR>, it is beneficial to eat out since we are able to enjoy various kinds of world’s food in restaurants. </MI1> <SI1><TR>Nowadays</TR>, there are so many restaurants from all over the world such as Mexican, Spanish or Thai restaurants. Eating out has strong advantage to experience those sorts of world’s food. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my family decided to have dinner out at least once a month and try a variety of kinds of world’s dishes. Each time, one of the family members chooses what to eat and other members ought to follow his decision whether someone does not like his option or not. This policy proved beneficial because all of the members found that there are a lot of delicious and healthy dishes from all over the world. My family still maintains this successful plan and I am really sure that rest of my family members also anticipate the next surprising eating out.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, eating out provides a good opportunity to experience a diversity of foods from other countries. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, there is no need to burden ourselves to do dishes or make foods. </MI2> <SI2>Most of mothers usually spend a large amount of time on preparing dishes for family. It could be irritating for mothers to make dishes for every day. <TR>Thus,</TR> eating out could be a solution for mothers since they do not need to worry about those burdensome works.<EX> According to a recent research from Oxford University, the families who eat out regularly shows a high level of sense of happiness while the families who rarely eat out presents relatively lower level of that. The researchers examined the reason for this and they found that the top rationale was that the family members feel doing dishes or preparing meals are quite boring and tedious. <TR>Therefore</TR>, the families prefer to eat out and it help for them to improve their sense of happiness</EX>. <TR>In this sense,</TR> eating out has a strong advantage to avoid boring things and it would be beneficial for family’s happiness. </SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it can be harmful for people who want to have a secured job if they habe tried many different jobs beforehand. </MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, people should search for a good job and stick to it otherwise they can give a bad signal to employers. <EX>In 2012, Harvard business school research team investigated Fortune 500 companies' human resource managers to find out what characteristic they really wanted for their potential employees. <TR>To our surprise</TR>, language proficiency or good grades were not their top priority. They regarded 'loyalty' as the most important factor when hiring workers. <TR>To put it in another way,</TR> they hated those who tried too many different jobs before applying for their company. They thought these applicants were not loyal to company, easy to go out voluntarily if they were unsatisfied with their job, and not patient to much stress in the workplace. <TR>Rather</TR>, they highly liked to hire who had no prior experience and possessed fresh mind.</EX> To avoid the possibility that regarded as a mistrusted person, people should not try several chances before getting a long-term job. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, people can substitute taking several job risks with many internship programs. </MI2> <SI2><TR>These days</TR>, many colleges and corporations provide various internship programs for to-be workers. By experience internship programs several times, people can find out what their real interest is and what kinds of factors they consider the most for a long-term work. After knowing these things, people can apply for the most suitable job to them and it can help them not to move among many jobs. <TR>In addition</TR>, applying for an internship is easier to get a chance than trying to find out a real job. With a small effort, time and cost, people can discover their true interest and priority. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, I highly support the idea that people should not try several jobs, and had better stick to a first job. One legendary CEO in South Korea recollected his memory, saying that 'Although it was hard to figure out whether my first job was suit to me at that time, I finally can conclude that it was my best choice I have ever made in my life.

968&All teachers are required to update their knowledge every five years,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether teachers ought to update their knowledge every five years. The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR>, I agree with the statement.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. </IN>

<BO1><MI1></TR>To begin with</TR>, teachers should revise their knowledge following changes in the world. </MI1> <SI1>In a modern society, information and knowledge change so quickly that things believed to be true would be converted into false at even a day. <TR>Therefore</TR>, living in the era, teachers should be forced to update their knowledge. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a high school student, I had a very old teacher and he was about to retire from his work. His class was so infamous since he taught students seriously old theories Students requested the teacher to deal with contemporary knowledge but he did not care at all.</EX> <TR>In the end,</TR> we were taught absolutely useless knowledge for a year. <TR>In this regard</TR>, teachers should be required to update their knowledge on regular period. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, if teachers are to be asked to update their knowledge and this policy is to be settled, quality of education would be improved significantly. </MI2> <SI2>Suppose this policy is settled firmly then teachers ought to try to improve their own knowledge. There is an adequate example for this situation. <EX>One of my friends’ schools adopted this sort of policy to its teachers. The teachers were provided proper opportunities and conditions to update their knowledge. Teachers were pleased at those chances since they also thought that they needed those opportunities. After several years, it is proved that the quality of teaching augmented dramatically and the school rewarded for “innovative school of the year.”</EX> <TR>In this sense</TR>, this plan would incline the quality of teaching and students will get benefits from it. </SI2></BO2>

In this essay, I will be two reasons for opinion. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, helping from their parents helps the young people to get practical advices. </MI1> <SI1>Because parents underwent countless success and failure, they have insight into the world. <TR>In other words</TR>, they could gain an upper-hand in finishing their assignment. <EX><TR>To illustrate this point</TR>, when I was in high school, my homework was that choose to what kinds of major in university is better for me. I was so confuse that which major would be better for me between Business and Math. Although Business looks like more prospective but I was fasnated with Math. After carefully consideration, I turned to my father for help. As he told me that he had the same experience when he selected major. As he was go-better when he studiedMath, he decided to major in Math. <TR>As a result</TR>, he could get enjoying jobs related to the major, and he was highly-paid. <TR>After that</TR>, I determined to decide to major in Math. If I had not done so, I would not be able to finish my work completely.</EX> </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, when it comes to getting stressed out, finishing their work alone is not beneficial. </MI2> <SI2>Thesedays, a number of the young people are stressed out because they are under pressure to have to complete their work just alone. From making food to getting a lot of information for assignment, it seems evitable to get stressed out. <TR>To be specific</TR>, if children get homework that they should make a variety of cookie, it could be stressful work to make it themselves. <TR>In addition</TR>, if children had little experience about finding books or using computer, it would be also desperate.<TR> On the other hand,</TR> if parents help these work, children could relieve stress. </SI2></BO2>

970&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to complain in person than in writing.,::,"<IN>Writing is a better method to express my opinion rather than speaking, since it offers me a time to prepare. <TS><TR>However</TR>, relating to complaining about some problems, it is better to speak in person than to write the letter. <TR>Thus</TR>, I agree with the statement and this is strongly substantiated by the points represented below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, this is because the object that has been complained by me also has a time to prepare if I write a letter. </MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, I lose chance to satisfy my complain since I gave the object a time to ready. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, if I complain in person, I can examine all the details and rules that support my idea and there are more possibility to accomplish my requirement. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I had a problem with my cell phone recently. My phone was a little bit broken since I first bought it and it finally collapsed after 1 week I bought it. I wrote a letter to improve my situation. <TR>However</TR>, the corporation made plausible excuse that contradict my argument, and rejected to give a new one. After my visiting cell phone store I bought, they realized that it was not my fault, and then gave me a new one, saying sorry.</EX> </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, there are more probabilities to socialize with the people. </MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it another way,</TR> by making a good relationship during complaining, it is more likely to solve problems in a desired way. <EX>There was a terrible accident recently, that a person who was not satisfied with the tone of the letter from his employer killed the employer. It would not have happened if they met each other and commuicate in good manner.</EX> There is also a research that justify my opinion. For the 300 neighbors in Seoul who are friendly each other, ther were no legal conflict. <TR>However</TR> in other places, which are also located in Seoul showed many problems and even sued each other. This shows how important to have a relationship with the people who have problems to be solved. </SI2></BO2>

971&One of the most characteristics of a good political or a business leader is the ability to accept responsibility for mistakes.,::,"<IN><TS>Qualifications politicians and company managers should have can be various according to individual but I think that the most important trait of a good leader is to admit to their mistakes caused by themselves.</TS> There are several reasons I could discuss to support my argument so I would limit my discussion to the two that are the most relevant to the topic. </IN>

<BO1><MI1>All the people make a mistake when deciding something. We occasionally say that since we are a human, it is natural to commit mistakes. </MI1> <SI1> <TR>However</TR>, most of the people have an aversion on denying mistakes and errors arouse by their hands because denying their mistake is equal to telling a lie. Some might say that acknowledging the mistake have a harm effect on a person`s career and ability, which result in the loss of important advantages but, rather, to avoid can cause more serious result. <EX>Let`s give an example. A company which has made varied groceries for a long time and has been known for their taste was accused of dead insect within a noodle. She took photos and uploaded them on her internet blog. As the fact spread widely and rapidly between people, the company should take a step immediately. After a few days, CEO of the company admitted their mistake apologizing to consumers and promised retrieving all the grocery in the market and strengthening all procedures of making and checking a food. Even though initially, there are so many appeals, protests and reproaches from consumers, as time elapsed many consumers started again buying the company`s products. If the company`s leaders did not take action swiftly and shifted the responsibility, consumers would not purchase the product permanently. A leader who avoiding their fault can escape from a flying arrow and pass their mistake on to other, but ultimately, he will lose their crucial surrounding people. This is why leaders have to admit their mistake.</EX> </SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, aggregating small environmentally friendly actions of individuals can be transformed into a tremendous result. </MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, even though a tiny effort of an individual might be small and insignificant, a big change can be realized if each effort of individuals gathers. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a few years ago a small city in Korea had a serious air pollution problem. Since there was drastic increase of cars in roads in the city, the air pollution got worse. In order to solve the problem, officers of the city made a campaign to public about using less own vehicles. Since almost everyone was aware of this serious problem, many people took public transportation instead of using their own cars. <TR>Finally,</TR> the air pollution level considerably was reduced thanks to efforts of the every person in the city. </EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of the claim above</TR>, initiatives which are concerned with environment but do not require individuals to take any action are likely to be inefficient. </MI2> <SI2><TR>Specifically</TR>, since issues of protecting environment are complicated, many nations spend considerable money on there or cooperate together to control them. <TR>However</TR>, since people would do the same thing that they did before without motivation for changing their attitude or behaviors, plans lack of individual efforts can be failed. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, a decade years ago the government of Korea started a plan improving the quality of the Han-river in Seoul. It spent nearly thousands of million dollars on the plan. <TR>However</TR>, the problem was the citizen who passed by there and did not stop throwing garbage to the river. <TR>Frequently</TR>, people came out to the river and did their laundries. <TR>As a result</TR>, the plan cost a lot but the quality of the water did not get better at all. If the plan had made people behave well, the result would have been different. </EX></SI2></BO2>

They say that it has more advantages than a way to make students take designated classes for mandatory. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>in my opinion</TR>, it is a bad idea to allow high school students to choose their classes freely.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, schools would be in very tight schedules if they allow students to take classes they want. </MI1> <SI1>Today, high school students are even too hectic and stressed out to follow regular courses because they have to get high scores from the tests. <TR>Moreover</TR>, they have to prepare for entering to universities. <TR>Therefore</TR>, there are no extra times for teaching subjects students choose because schedules are saturated with basic courses. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there are schools specialized in science and mathematics for gifted students in Korea. They have distinctive departments for each majors and make students accumulate credits by choosing classes freely. Since they are allowed to choose their classes themselves, they have to finish regular classes in a year. <TR>Thus</TR>, they say that they even feel too nervous when a clock sounds for a second even though they are talented in studying. <TR>Ultimately</TR>, students are in too tight schedules because they have to finish both regular classes and additional classes they choose. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, the classes could be declined as ‘playing classes’. </MI2> <SI2>Since there are some students who are not interested in studying, they would flock with each other and can distract the classes.

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, teachers and students would be confused to take courses because all students over their classes are mixed together. </MI3> <SI3><TR>First</TR>, teachers would have difficulties of checking attendances of students because students in a class are dispersed to many classes. <TR>Second</TR>, students would be distressed because there are many students who do not know each other. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was in a school, there were many students, who went to their homes stealthily instead of participating in club activities. <TR>However</TR>, homeroom teachers could not know who went to homes or be late for classes because all teachers who instruct the activities were too busy to send attendance records to the homeroom teachers. </SI3></BO3>

Our short-term memories can only store between five and nine things at once. This means the productivity’s efficiency is drastically reduced when a person do many works at the same time. There was a survey made by the famous magazine “the Forbes” proving that human’s brain loses up about 70% of their memory when they work on a task. If a person tries to do several tasks at same time, the person loses 90% of the memories related to the works in an hour. <TR>Thus</TR>, human was not born with the ability to multitask. </SI1></BO1>

Later both groups were interviewed and the result showed that Group A was more enthusiastic in teaching students, whereas Group B showed just a plain behavior and were not really passionate.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, higher salary can help teachers offer students more materials and better information. </MI2> <SI2>This is because teachers can buy some educational tools and can educate themselves by spending increased salaries. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my uncle was an English grammar teacher in the middle school. <TR>However</TR>, my uncle never practiced English speaking. <TR>Therefore</TR>, he could not speak English very well.

980&University students should be required to attend classes.,::,"<IN>Since matriculating in college, I have seen many students frequently forgoing classes and others taking attendance seriously and observed the impact of this difference on academic achievement. Some maintain that regular attendance of class is not a critical component of effective performance but usually nothing is further from the truth referring to the testimonies of considerable number of students on college academics. Quite a few professors would accept it as undeniable truth that students taking classes seriously are more prone to succeed in class than those who are not. Besides what final grade implies, many other factors come into play in determining the characteristics of college students when it comes to attending classes. <TS>I will summarize some of the findings that suggest the importance of regular participation of classes to students who hope for success both in and out of college classes.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Attending lecture teaches you basic responsibility as a student to be successful in academic and career life. </MI1> <SI1>Students encounters several obligations as a learner in classes such as arriving in class on time, submitting homework and assignment, preparing for tests and so forth. It is one of grading criteria striving to prove that students are qualified and diligent candidates for an excellent grade. To ensure excellent performance on those necessitates regular attendance of class to check back professor’s lectures and know what is going on and when is the due date of assignment. Completion of tasks in classes imparts students the basic characteristics of taking responsibility and working diligently to succeed in any job outside classes as constituents of society and workforce. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>One learns broad scope of knowledge that is not coming from books and other accommodations by participating in classes. </MI2> <SI2>I personally speculate that regular attendance of lectures foster better understanding of materials and provide vast information to be focused on that is not in books. <TR>Moreover</TR>, lecture component of classes is a panoramic view of what professors expect me to know and what the test questions will be like. Books usually contain comprehensive range of materials yet lack the ability to highlight vital information. <TR>In addition</TR>, through attending classes, one obtains valuable opportunities to participate in discussion with classmates and professors. By interacting with and asking professors inquiries, students come to learn what was previously unknown and confronts opposing viewpoints, which is not achieved through reading tons of books on class materials. </SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>How attending lecture improves grade is simple yet multidimensional fundamentals. </MI3> <SI3>From my four years of college experience, I can confidently insist that there is no better strategy than attending classes regularly to be a good test taker. Unless I went through basic ideas of each lecture and set aside time for complementing this knowledge, I used to cram for the test night before and the test result was devastating when I did that. The best tactic is to study diligently every week, but I soon realized this is accomplished only by being in every class. I came to approach the topics easily and tackle information only when sit there to listen to lectures and take notes. Besides preparing me for exams, attending lecture improved my overall grade by helping homework problems and answering some of my questions. </SI3></BO3>

<CO>Whether it is generally agreed or disagreed, I think every story of students prove that attending class is essential to success in college classes. Along with teaching you fundamental responsibility as a student and job candidates, class participation provides information outside books and other viewpoints on issues. <TR>What’s more</TR>, attending lecture better prepares you for exams and improves your overall grade by accommodating academic performance. Although some professors do not integrate class attendance into students’ grade, I think it should be a universal requirement for college students. </CO>

981&Do you agree or disagree with following statement? Nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion.,::,"<IN>Since the world is developing as time passes, people who fulfilled their essential needs began to concern about their external things such as personal appearance and fashion. <TS><TR>However</TR>, it is getting exuberant and people put too much emphasis on them.</TS> I totally agree with the statement, and this is greatly substantiated by the reasons presented below. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, some people even are taking risks to improve their appearance. </MI1> <SI1>To put it another way, even though they are aware of the danger they should risk, some people are still wanting and taking cosmetic surgery. According to the reasearch of science lab in Seoul National University, every cosmetic surgery has more than 1% of possibility that might lead to death of the object and the objects are told before the surgery begins. <TR>Nevertheless</TR>, there are not much people who stop surgery and of course, 1% of people end up their lives doing the surgery. They just lose their lives in an attempt to be a little more attractive outward. This proves for what extent people are concerned about their appearance and that it is too much if think rationally. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, annually changing fashion trends also shows that people are putting too much concern on their fashion. </MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words</TR>, new fashion trends are altering old ones rapidly because people desire to be differentiated with others. <TR>Thus</TR>, in every season, completely different sorts of clothings compared to previous year are exhibited in magazines. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> almost all of my friends go to shopping when season changes, because clothings they have are already out of date.</EX> New arrivals are full in department stores, and there are filled with numerous people who want to buy new clothings. The formal presentation of Sinsagae Department store also shows that more than 15% of profit is gained by fashion-related products. This surely authenticate people are paying too much attention on fashion. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To summarize</TR>, there is a proverb that says, ""If you want to know about a person, look at one's demeanor."" Flourishing cosmetic industries and fashion industries testify that many people are paying too much attention on their personal appearance and fashion. To be a better society, it would be nice if they pay attention to both inner and outer portions. </CO>

982&Most problems which affect your society will be solved during your lifetime.,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether most problems in society will be solved in this century. People from different walks of life may take different stances on this issue. <TS><TR>Personally</TR>, I believe that most social problems are likely to be solved in my lifetime, and there are two reasons that could validate my position.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>The first point is that environmental pollution would be solved by worldwide efforts. </MI1> <SI1>This is widely accepted that environmental destruction is a serious problem that should not be over looked. Especially, the production and use of fossil fuels causes serious damage to the environment by releasing greenhouse gas and depleting the ozone layer. <TR>As this regard</TR>, many countries has concerned about such problem and made all-out efforts to reduce the leading causes of global warming. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, they have tried to pass a international law related to restriction on the use of gasoline and diesel fuel.</EX> <TR>In response to this</TR>, the global automobile industry make effort to develop cars that use echo-friendly energy. This kind of responses from industries and company have positive effects on recovering the environment. Also many people change the way of consumption, buying eco-friendly products I. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason is that advanced technology would get rid of poverty.</MI2><SI2> It is no secret that food is significant matter for people to live. <TR>Thus</TR>, from past to present, I has tried to save people from poverty. <TR>Currently</TR>, scientist develop a novel technology which can distribute food sources effectively.

Children should not make important decisions alone",::,"<IN>Along with vast societal advancements, some issues are gaining popularity among the populace, one of which is whether children should be left to make important decisions alone. <TS>In view of today’s communal conditions, it would be inappropriate to let children make important decisions all by themselves; however it would be more suitable to guide them and oversee them to make right choices.</TS> Amidst the insurmountable bases which formulated my stand, seemingly there are two eye-catching facets. </IN>

<BO1><MI1>The initial motive for my stand that is exceptionally evident is that the problems that children face these days are too complicated. </MI1> <SI1>It is simply too hard for children to estimate what their choice would eventually turn out. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when children choose which subject to take at school they tend to choose a subject with less burden or simply follow their friends. <TR>However</TR>, there are some essential prerequisite subjects that they need to take in order to understand more difficult subjects to come. <EX>One of my friend, who wanted to become a software developer, stopped taking math classes after 7th grade because he found it very boring. He thought there was no connection between computer and math. Apparently he failed to get an admission for the computer science department and regrets his foolish decision greatly. </EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>A further cause why I am for the same opinion with aforesaid explanation is that children do not have ability to be responsible for their decisions. </MI2> <SI2>Sometimes a wrong decision might cost thousands of dollars to others and the person who made such decision. <TR>However</TR>, children do not posses such amount of money or legal responsibility for the damage they have done.

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, it is not appropriate to let children make important decisions alone because problems they face are too complicated and they are usually not responsible for what they have done. Anchored on aforesaid evaluations and arguments we can conclusively say that children should not make important decisions alone. <TR>However</TR>, everything has two sides, it would not be wise to oppress children and tie their hands because they need to develop sense of self-esteem.

984&Playing computer games is a waste of time. Children should not be allowed to play them.,::,"<IN>Some people argue that playing computer games is fun and get their stress out. <TS><TR>However</TR>, since there are more negative effects of enjoying computer games than positive ones, I think that children should not be allowed to play them.</TS> This is because computer games contain harmful contents such as violence or sex, and children can be addicted to the games easily, which ruins their grades. </IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all<TR>, many computer games have violent or sexual features, which give negative influences on children's personality development. </MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, if children repeatedly play games related to shooting guns and killing others, they get used to those actions and can be confused between the game and the real world where they live. <EX>For example, last year a ten years old kid shot his friend with his father's bullet in U.S.A. The kid said that his friend made him angry for a tiny fault so he killed him. The police who investigated on him found out that he constantly played a cruel shooting game so he became aggressive.</EX> This example shows a negative effect of playing computer games. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, addiction to computer games causes children to get poor academic performance. </MI2> <SI2><TR>Specifically</TR>, many people can be easily addicted to computer games because the games have features that make people continue to play. Especially, since children in general have less ability to control themselves, they are more likely to be addicted and it leads to getting poor grades from their school. <TR>For instance</TR>, a report conducted by a famous psychologist shows that children addicted to playing computer games have lower grades from school than ordinary children. The expert explains that those game-addicted children easily fail to control their time and have less concentration skill on study. </SI2></BO2>

Even in western society, they viewed nature as the products to use for their own establishment. It has not been so long that we began to care about nature, though it is little. There are distinct features that show how earth has affected by human activities. Many other creatures living on earth was just considered trivial. According to research conducted by UN, from 1900 to 1950, more than 20% of all the insects in the world extincted because they have no habitat to live in which is caused by human activity. Even more, 50% of remaining insects extinced in the period of 1950 to 2000 by human-related activities.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that the opinions of celebrities give less stress for younger people. </MI1> <SI1>In current society, younger people are really stressed out. <EX>This reminds me of a time when I was sophomore in university. I was able to decide a candidate among several candidates because one figure I have respect presented his opinion on his Social Network Service. My parents read newspaper every morning, and watch the news whenever they watch television. I <TR>however</TR>, do not like watching the news because it is too much stressful, so it was pretty difficult for me to decide whom to be selected. <TR>One day</TR>, my favorite actor Kim posted his opinion about politician and I agreed with him. Eventually I choose one candidate whose politic philosophy accord with Kim’s opinion. If Kim were not to post his opinion about politics, I would not be able to decide a candidate and receive stress. </EX>As my experience shows, opinions of celebrities help younger people not be stressed out. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, another reason for my thinking this way is that the opinions of celebrities are more efficient for younger people than for older people. </MI2> <SI2>Success is very important in our lives. A recent newspaper article I read on the Korea Herald revealed some interesting findings. According to a survey, the amount of young CEO who are affected from celebrities has increased twofold in the past 5 years. The subjects mention that the opinions of celebrities are more efficient than those of their friends, and families. This is because many young people do watch television, use smart phone, and read books. <TR>In contrast</TR>, older people watch television, use smart phone, and read books less than younger people. Through these activities, it is easy to access to thought and opinion of eminent people. This result clearly shows that opinions of celebrities are more important for many younger people. </SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, with the reasons mentioned above, I believe that I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic. </CO>
