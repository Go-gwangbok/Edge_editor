"353&Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN>There are some people who believe that success is purely a matter of luck. Like what they say, luck is an important feature of every success story. <TS>Every successful people appear to have some kind of attitude that makes them fearlessly put themselves in a peril, and also, it is essential to have the ability to take chances.</TS> These are, however, the things that will only come after a certain thing has been done. That certain thing is a careful, thorough planning and preparation.</IN>

<BO1><MI1>Why do planning and preparation have to be done before you go on to take risks and chances?</MI1><SI1> That's because they are the very basis of success- in other words, thorough planning and preparation is a solid grounding to success. It's like, without having your own solid building site, you cannot expect to build anything, nor can you even expect the bricks and other building equiments to arrive. Without careful planning and preparation beforehand, you won't be able to even have a chance to take a risk or to seize the chance that comes.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Besides</TR>, let's say, even though you had not done any planning or preparation at all, a chance came to you by a pure luck.</MI2><SI2> Even if such a thing happened, you still wouldn't be able to fully take that chance and get the full benefit of it. Maybe you wouldn't even recognise a chance came... You need to do the planning and preparation to obtain a precise knowledge of what you are aiming for and what will help you to achieve that aim. </SI2>Hoping for a success with no preparation is just like hoping for straight As in exams with no preparations.</BO2>

<CO>There are success stories that tells you that they achieved such success by grabbing a fabulous chance that came across them. That fabulous chance does not just come to anybody- behind every success stories there are always hidden efforts and careful plannings. Chances only come to those who are ready to take the chance. To those without a careful planning and preparation, no chance will be given. Everything comes in order and so does success. Without a thorough planning and preparation, nothing will come. Nothing.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,The essay does not have a strong topic or thesis statement that allows for the author to make great argumnets or examples to prove any real point besides the generic fact that planning might help a person. It doesn't quite prove that planning leads or causes succes..,//
