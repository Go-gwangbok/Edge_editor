Scientist should take responsibility for their inventions when they have the potential to be dangerous to humans.	::	<IN>Some people believe that scientist should not take responsibility for their inventions when they have the potential to be dangerous to humans because this people think that inventions which are developed by scientists are so useful for living of human. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I think that they should have responsibility for their inventions when they have dangerous factors.</TS> There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that they have known negative effect of their inventions. And the other reason is that taking responsibility can give scientists opportunity to develop their studies.</IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> scientists know that they are creating something that has the potential to cause serious destruction. <TR>As a result,</TR> they should share the moral responsibility.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when the atom bomb was developed, Robert Opphenheimer knew that the atom bomb can cause to kill many people and to make cities devastated. But he made the atom bomb and it contributed to break out the second world war.</EX> <SI1><TR>Finally,</TR> creating the atom bomb exchanged the lives of people.</SI1> This example shows that scientist should take the responsibility for their inventions.</BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> if scientist has responsibility, they can have a chance to develop their research.</MI2> <SI2>Taking responsibility can make that scientists are concerned about public opinion through the internet or news. So they can earn feedback quickly on their creations and it can be foundation to advance the inventions of high quality. <TR>As a result,</TR> taking responsibility for scientist invention bring about improvement of society.</SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> scientists already know that how their creation dangerous and scientist also have an opportunity to develop their creations.

Your thesis statement is good and so is your first reason, but the second reason is weak and requires more explanation.  Also, check your facts - Oppenheimer built the atom bomb in the middle of the second world war, and he did not fully realize the danger of it.  That is one weak point in your argument - sometimes scientists DON'T know that their inventions will be used negatively.  Overall, you have organized this essay very well, and your transitions are great.  Excellent structure, and good use of vocabulary.	//
What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.	::	<IN>As more and more people are seeking after a job where it offers a fine salary, people begin to realize that having a good supervisor is another important fact when considering for a job. In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>For starters,</TR> good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees promote faster and that is what they do in their position at work.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In addition,</TR> this not only make the employees enhance their positions but paves the way to make company a better reputation by having good leaders.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my older sister, who finished graduate school, got a job where it gives enough salary. <TR>Afterwards,</TR> my sister had a supervisor who had a very strong leadership. Since the boss led my sister very well with good judgement and nice advices, she promoted much faster than her friends from graduate school.</EX> This implies that strong leadership is a very important characteristic of a good supervisor.<BO1>  <BO2><TR>Secondly,</TR> friendly leader is probably what the all employees are wishful to have at their work place. <SI2>This is because most of the workers from all over the world suffer from stresses at work because of high pressure from boss or because of unfriendly environment.<SI2><MI2><TR>However,</TR> if a leader is very friendly, that will create much comfortable atmosphere where all of the employees can work with such enjoyment and that will eventually lead to a long term work.</MI2> <EX><TR>To be more detailed,</TR> there was a survey among the workers from renowned company about the reason why they work in the long term. <TR>Not surprisingly,</TR> about half of them answered because of the high name value of the company, but other half of them responded that it is because of good leaders who are very friendly.</EX> This definitely implies the important quality of a good supervisor is a amiable personality.</BO2>  <CO><TR>On the whole,</TR> even though the jury is still out, I firmly believe that having a good leadership and friendly personality is the most significant traits among others because of faster promotion and enjoyable atmosphere at work.</CO>	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	4	::	This is an excellent essay.

You have received a gift of money. The money is enough to buy either a piece of jewelry you like or tickets to a concert you want to attend.

The jewelry could be valuable in realistic. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly recommend visiting the concert instead of buying a piece of jewelry for two points.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1>First point is that people hardly need worrying about losing memories.</MI1> A piece of jewelry would make people worry about losing it. Because of these worries, people can suffer from their mental stress. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> the memory is not going anywhere. <TR>Moreover,</TR> the impression that people could get from the concert would makes people happy. <SI1>With the help of the concert, people could refreshed and concentrate in their work much better by relieving stress form daily life.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when people get a lottery, they might be happy at first. <TR>However,</TR> there is a chance that it could be stolen or lost.

The ability to read and write is more important today than in the past. Do you agree or disagree?	::	<IN>A lot of controversy exists over whether the literacy ability is more significant nowadays than in the past.

Which do you prefer working alone or working with a team?  	::	<IN>Co-working and collaboration are hot issues today. The society is more complex than before which means that there is no definitive answer for problem solving in these days. <TR>Thus,</TR> we need to listen carefully and to understand deeply the other's voices.

The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.  	::	<IN>Some people say that it is important to cooperate with others well today than in the past. <TS><TR>However,</TR> on the other hand, I think that it is more important in the past than now to cooperate with people for the following reasons : people were not able to make up their living if they do not cooperate and because they have neighbours very close to them, it was important to cooperate.</TS> </IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> it was important to cooperate with others to help out each other when they need some help.</MI1> This is due to the fact that people had to make all things by themselves at that time and those works required a lot of labor sometimes like when you are building a house or planting rice. It was not easy for them to do those things by themselves as it took lots of time and effort. <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> there was a research done by Seoul National University showing comparison between the past and now how things got simpler and easier by the technology development.

Your points are well-made and very clear.  Your writing is fluid and you use good examples.  I like that your writing style is a little bit scientific, in that you state your point, back it up with reason and example, and then say "Therefore, that is why I feel this way." It is a very clear ending point.  Nice work.	//
The purpose of television should be for education, not for entertainment. Do you agree or disagree?	::	<IN>The world we are living in has changed significantly from the beginning.

Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own.	::	<IN>There is an argument over whether Because environmental issues are very complex, individual people can do nothing about them on their own. <TS>I disagree that individual people can’t do anything about environmental issues for two reasons. <TR>First,</TR> the reason of global warming which is the biggest environmental problem is carbon emissions from cars. <TR>Second,</TR> individual people can have a great impact on environmental issues through the Internet.</TS> </IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> carbon emissions from cars have a negative effect on environment.</MI1> Some people might say that only government can solve the environmental problems since it is too complex. <TR>However,</TR> let me show an example to prove why individual people can help to solve the environmental issues. <EX>Human beings are currently experiencing the warmest temperatures in history. It is true that global warming has a negative effect on mankind throughout the world. Floods and landslides took the lives of countless people as well as placing affected areas at health risk. European nations were no exception. Many areas there were flooded or suffered wildfire.<TR> Sadly,</TR> it was extremely costly to ensure that all victims were able to put their lives back together.</EX> <MI1>Carbon emissions from cars and other human activities are largely responsible for global warming.</MI1> <SI1>Various measures are being taken by governments to handle this problem. Efforts to develop better technology for solar and wind energy are gaining momentum.  Governments ask people to use subways and buses on their way to home and work rather than driving their own cars. Driving less and using public transportations can be done by people’s individual efforts.</SI1> This shows that individual people can help to solve environmental problems by driving less and using public transportation. </BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> environmental issues can be affected by individual people thanks to Internet.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my house is located near the industrial area. One day, I found that some factories in that area emit harmful chemicals to the river. So I put a post on electronic bulletin in the government website. Because of my report, factories should fine a lot of money and the environmental regulations in that area are strengthened.</EX> This proves that individual efforts through the internet can help to improve environmental situation. </BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I disagree that individual people can’t do anything about environmental issues for the reasons I have mentioned above. <TR>First,</TR> carbon emissions from cars have a negative effect on environment. <TR>Second,</TR> environmental issues can be affected by individual people thanks to Internet.</CO>  	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	Another great essay.

I would put your main idea and supporting idea first, and then work into the example.	//
In order to stay well-informed, people should get information from various news sources.	::	<IN>It is evident that in our current society, getting news from a variety of media has tremendous importance in our lives and it is common thing.  Opinions are divided over the taking information from various sources is needed to people in order to be well informed. I do not agree with this statement for two reasons.  <TR>Firstly,</TR> different view of many sources is confusing. <TR>Moreover,</TR> I think getting information from various news sources keep people from deep understanding.</IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>More than anything else,</TR> people would be confused when they get information from a lot of news sources, because each media has different opinion about one fact. <TR>Thus</TR> people cannot be in well informed.</MI1> <EX>This reminds me of the time when I traveled to some countries of Africa in college years. While there, I was highly shocked by the large number of people who were suffering from starvation and AIDS.  Naturally I become to have interest about problem of poverty in Africa countries. So, when I came back to the Korea, I searched information about those countries that I visited from many websites. I read lots of articles,<TR> however,</TR> each of them has different contents. Some sources said that countries’ government in Africa does not spend their money improving quality of people’s lives. <TR>In contrast,</TR> other news said that their government cannot afford to support their nation, and serious poverty is caused by not enough aid from advanced countries. <TR>Therefore,</TR> after I saw these sources, I could not know the real truth and confused due to the totally different information.</EX><TR> As my experience shows,</TR> the information from various materials makes people to be confused.</BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition,</TR> I think it is impossible to have deep understanding without enough time for one source.</MI2> Let me explain my case that can support my claim. <EX>When I was in high school, I had to submit report about global warming in the class. I was eagerly in that class, so thought that getting lots of information is best way to know the issue. <TR>Thus,</TR> I tried to find information as many as possible both in library and in video posted in the Internet. <TR>However,</TR> it was impossible for me to fully understand all detail of my all collected sources because of enormous quantity of information. <TR>Thus,</TR> teacher of that class gave me a comment that I have a just superficial knowledge, and suggested me to read just one thesis many times than to glance many articles to stay in well informed.</EX> <TR>In this sense,</TR> we can definitely notice that if we obtain information from many new sources, we cannot totally understand all of it. </BO2>  <CO><TR>As mentioned above regarding the issue,</TR> I think people are not able to stay well informed when they get information from many news media for following reasons. First reason is that people are confused by different information from variety of news sources. Furthermore, lots of news materials prevent people from fully understanding of exact fact.  <TS><TR>In a nutshell,</TR> finding information from lots of new sources is not beneficial to stay well informed.</TS></CO> 	::	5	::	3	::	4	::	5	::	4	::	3	::	3	::	4	::	5	::	This essay is a little sloppy.

People learn more by watching television than by reading books.	::	<IN>People might argue that people learn more by reading book than watching television. <TS><TR>On the other hand,</TR> I believe that people learn more by watching television for the following reasons : visual aids help people understand better and television provides all kinds of information all around the world.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> people can understand better by looking at the visual aids provided by television.</MI1> There will be no misunderstanding of picturing things unlike the books. <SI1>Because books are written in words, describing things, there can be misunderstanding if one understand the description wrongly and think of the thing the other way.</SI1> <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> my little brother was studying about wild life animals.

Exams encourage students to learn.	::	<IN>There is a controversy over whether examinations are necessarily needed for stduents to study. Some people argue that exams are not encouraging since they make students feel stressed out and thus hinder students from learning harder. <TS><TR>In contrast,</TR> I strongly believe that exams encourage students to learn since it is a stimulus for studying hard and it is an objective evaluation to know one's level.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> exams have a positive effect on students' learning by giving them a positive stimulus.</MI1> This is because students would like to get a good grade on the test and receive recognition from their teacher, parents and friends. Most students, even students who usually do not study cram the exams before the midterms and finals. <EX>A recent study best illustrates this point. Researchers divide students into two groups. After giving each groups a English vocabulary list and making them memorize it for twenty minutes, they conduct the quiz. The average grade of the one group who was been told in advance that there would be a test was much higher than the grade of the other group who was not warned before the test. It turned out that the students in the first group concentrated on studying vocabularies while the other students felt idle not worried about the test.</EX> <SI1><TR>That is,</TR> the existence of the exams affect students' attitude toward learning.</SI1></BO1>  </BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> Exam is a good opportunity that students can exactly know about their level in their learning.</MI2> <SI2>This is because exams let students acknowledge which part they are good at and which part they need to improve more. Thanks to such feedback, students would study the weak point harder for a better understanding.</SI2> <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> when I took an English speaking course in college, my professor had a test that students should interview in English with him. <TR>At first,</TR> the thought of speaking English in front of him gave me too much pressure. <TR>However,</TR> after the test he could accurately point out my mistakes such as tail-tones that I did not notice. If I had not been for the speaking test, I would have not known my mistaken pronounciation. <TR>As a result,</TR> I am practicing to get rid of the tail tones and it is improving.</EX></BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I definitely agree that an exam is a helpful tool for students since they stimulate students to focus on studying more and students realize themselves if they are keeping with the class  and the topic. <TR>On the whole,</TR> students need exams that play a pivotal role on learning to develop the students' studying.</CO>  	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	Very good essay.

Students learn more important things in life inside the classroom than outside the classroom.	::	<IN>In today’s globalized society, it is widely believed that students learn more in their classroom rather than outside the classroom. Some people advocate that students can learn more in classrooms because there are teachers’ help, peers who study together and academic atmosphere. <TR>However,</TR> I disagree with this view. <TS>I firmly believe that students can learn not only academic knowledge but also important life lessons outside the classes.</TS> This is because first, they can relieve their stress and second, students can broaden their perspective by doing extracurricular activities.</IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> learning outside the classrooms is more important because it helps students relieve their stress and restore the health.</MI1> <TR>To be more specific,</TR> when students leave their classroom, they can feel free and enjoy their leisure time which as a result allows them to manage their stress, maintain health and build a quality life. <SI1> <TR>Actually,</TR> stress is a major cause of several diseases, short life span and dissatisfying life in general. As such, people on modern society should actively find the ways to reduce their stress and stay healthy. Students can do this when they are released from the school.<SI1> <EX>When I was young, school time was really stressful because I had to stay ahead and absorb information without rest. When I came back home, I went to bed immediately due to severe fatigue. My parents wanted to help me, so they planned to go to trip with me. After the trip I felt happy and I could forget about stressful aspect of my life. My health state was also enhanced. Through this experience, I realized that we cannot live quality life without outclass activities. <TR>Therefore,</TR> parents and teachers should offer some entertainment for students to enjoy outside of classroom.</EX></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Also,</TR> students can broaden their perspective by extracurricular activities outside the school.</MI2>  <TR>In other words,</TR> classrooms in school are some kind of closed society. Students’ views are limited because they always meet same people. Playing or doing something outside help students become more open-minded which as result allows them to better understand other cultures, different life styles and perspectives. <SI2>As modern society is becoming increasingly globalized, today’s world requires people with a strong understand of international view. Students are able to grow people whom the world wants by experiences from out of classes.</SI2> <EX><TR>To illustrate,</TR> Steven Jobs who is the founder of Apple Company made great accomplishments in his life time. I read online that he was really successful because he was global-minded and culturally sensitive.  He did this by going outside, meeting different people, traveling other country. <TR>In other words,</TR> he enjoyed his leisure time outside the school or company.</EX> <TR>Thus,</TR> it is legitimated to say that students should have their own time that can be used outside the campus.<BO2>  <CO><TR>All things considered,</TR> It is my belief that my argument regarding to this topic is effectively and precisely delivered with reasons mentioned above. Never should we forget that this issue may have a huge effect on our future.</CO>  	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	In my opinion, this is an A+ essay.

Children should wait until they start school to learn a foreign language.	::	<IN>It is commonly believed that children should master their own mother languages and wait until they start school to learn a foreign language. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I disagree with the statement because children learn better and quicker at early childhood, children are exposed to other languages before they enter schools, and there are growing numbers of immigrant and multicultural families.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> children learn foreign languages better and quicker when they are at early childhood.</MI1> <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my cousin moved to New Jersey with his 5years old daughter two years ago. I remember my cousin worrying about his daughter when she first entered the kindergarten. He worried about his daughter because of the language barrier and if she'd get bullied by her classmates. <TR>However,</TR> I went to visit my cousin last month and I was surprised to see how my niece spoke English so fluently with almost perfect pronunciation. My cousin also told me that sometimes his daughter corrects him with pronunciations and he is very proud of his daughter being even more fluent English speaker than himself.</EX></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> it is inevitable for young people to learn other languages before entering schools.</MI2> <TR>That is,</TR> there are English words everywhere in Korea. <EX>Whenever I turn on the TV, internet or even walk around the streets, I see alphabets.</EX> <SI1>Children are exposed to English at a very young age even though they are not all English speakers.

You organized your essay pretty well, and backed up most of your points well, especially the one with the example of your cousin.  I think the last point about multicultural families could be stronger.  It is worth pointing out that these children that grow up speaking two languages have an advantage over children that grow up speaking one.	//
We should let children realize their faults and mistakes on their own.  	::	<IN>There are some different opinions among people regarding whether it is proper to let children be in troubles until they realize what will happen to them. <TS>Although it is true that children can develop a sense of independence and a skill to handle some troubles they are undergoing, I believe that those ones are not the duty of adults, who are required to take care of their children so carefully.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons to support my idea.</IN>  <BO1><MI1>To begin with, with children having little experience, they are not capable of discriminating the good from the bad.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Specifically,</TR> children are no more than ten years old, which shows that they have spent little time accumulating valuable experiences that can make them learn how to expect their behaviors.

It just needs to be reworded.  Your main points are very clear and well stated, as well as your supporting statements, but your examples are lacking a little bit.  Your first example of chopsticks does not really seem to be the kind of trouble the topic requires.  In contrast, your second example is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum - if parents let their kids solve dangerous problems they would not be considered fit parents.  I think it is a little extreme for this topic.  Try to search for examples somewhere in the middle.	//

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to watch serious movies that are designed to make you think than to watch movies that are primarily designed to amuse or entertain.	::	<IN>For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 6000 years, sources of entertainment has always existed. <TR>Nowadays,</TR> watching movies is the most popular way of spending free time. There are largely two genres of movies: comedy movies, and serious movies. Some may argue that the movies primarily designed to amuse or entertain people are better. <TS><TR>Nevertheless,</TR> serious movies are more preferable to most of the people for two reasons: they make people ponder about social issues, and contain the director’s life experiences and wisdom that are worth spreading.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> serious movies help people to think about the social issues, which they rarely discuss about.</MI1> <SI1>There certain problems of the society which are uncomfortable to talk about with friends or co-workers, such as capital punishment, selfish human nature, or sexual crimes.</SI1> Yet, serious movies often deal with the social issues that are touchy. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> Batman series: Batman begins, Dark knight, and Dark knight returns, directed by Christopher Nolan, is about the hero who saves the city, but only receive blames from the citizens and considered as convict. The movie can be seen as one of the silly super hero movies that only children would love. <TR>Yet,</TR> surprisingly, the series of movies deal with the drawbacks of the society so well that even made my brother to think about why does people have to be so selfish.</EX> If it were not for the batman series, he would be still ignorant with the problems of our society.<BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that,</TR> the director’s life experiences and knowledge that are worth spreading are comprised in serious movies.</MI2> <SI2>Living in the world with the overflowing information requires, indirect experiences, in order to learn everything. <TR>Therefore,</TR> people often read to gain knowledge that is summarized or organized by other people.</SI2> <SI3><TR>Recently,</TR> movies are replacing the role of books, because it delivers information and someone else’s experiences with more details, which makes easier and efficient for the viewer to comprehend and learn.</SI3> <SI4><TR>Sadly,</TR> not all the genres of movies can do the jobs. Especially, humorous movies cannot covey any thoughts or experiences, because their primary job is to amuse and arouse laughter from people.</SI4> <EX><TR>To be specific,</TR> there is a comedy movie named glory of the family. It is a Korean movie that depicts the life to a Korean gangster family that always gets into the trouble. There is no distinct storyline, and only exaggerated gestures and silly dialogues. Everyone who watched the movie says that it was funny, but says that they did not learn anything from the movie. On the other hand, since serious movies are designed to deliver messages, they contain the subjects that spur people to think deeply.</EX><BO2>  <CO>Comedy movies are amusing and fun and entertaining. They help people to release their stress and to get away from the reality for a moment. <TR>Nonetheless,</TR> unlike from watching serious movies, no productive results can be expected from watching comedy movies. <TR>As a result,<TR> watching the movies that are deep and message containing is definitely better than watching the movies that are only interesting and humorous.</CO> 	::	4	::	3	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	4	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	This essay is put together a little strangely.  Your thesis is all right, but the second point you make is unclear.  I'm not sure what you mean.  It seems like your second point should be that comedies overshadow important issues.  You say some interesting things in your second paragraph, but they don't flow very well with the rest of your argument.  There are two distinct ideas in there, and they should be reorganized so they fit better.	//
Human activities have enhanced and improved the Earth.	::	<IN>As the technology is advancing, there is a lot of controversy over whether the Earth have been improved and enriched by human activities. <TS>I firmly believe that people have brought exorbitant damage to the Earth by destroying the environment and decreasing the diversity of nature.</TS> </IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> human activities have a negative impact on the earth more than a positive effect since human activities exploited the natural resources.</MI1> <TR>That is,</TR> in order for people to live conveniently and affluently, they have thoughtlessly built the basic infrastructures, buildings and factories at the expense of the environment. <SI1><TR>Also,</TR> although cars made people's life more convenient, the air pollution was worsen because of the gases emitted by cars.</SI1> <EX>Industrial Revolution plainly demonstrates this point well. During this period, people was occupied with replacing lands and forests with numerous factories. They cleared away the woodlands and forests to build as many factories as they could. <TR>After all,</TR> the deforestation made the land susceptible to flooding and erosion. <TR>Hence,</TR> people literally devastated the environment.</EX></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> people's actions reduced the variety of foliages and faunas.</MI2> This is because people put their own interests as the first priority than any other living creatures. People does not hesitate to abuse or even worse slaughter animals to meet the desire, which cause the increased endangered animals. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> as salmon is popular among people nowadays, the demand for it is greatly increasing. Despite the limited resources, fishers are obsessed with catching them to maximize profits. They try to catch salmons more than they are allowed to do by laws and do not care about whether they are being extinct or not.</EX> <SI2><TR>Therefore,</TR> the number of endangered animals and plants are greatly soaring.</SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> I strongly believe that people's selfish activities negatively affected the earth since people exploited the environment and decreased the diversity of wildlife. People should not behave as if they had own the earth, but rather they they should try to protect it by living together with the Earth. </CO>  	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	A very strong essay.

If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change?

Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Other think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.	::	<IN>Some people might say " I don't need a teacher. I can learn things all by myself!". I don't think it is unreasonable to say this, unless he or she has a proper knowledge. <TR>However,</TR> when it comes to me, I definately need a teacher to motivate me and lead me to a right path. <TS>Since I don't have a ability to concentrate on a task, nor the deep knowledge of subjects,I obviously need somebody who can teach me.</TS> </IN>  <BO1>To begin with, as I mentioned above, I'm not a well-informed man with broad vision. If so, I would say that I can learn solitarily. <TR>But,</TR> since my knowledge of subjects are yet shallow, I need a teacher. <MI1>Most teachers got a broad vision on what they teach and thus they can give me a proper knowledge in effective way.</MI1> Since they are professionals, they can promptly and accurately give me a knowledge. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> If I am learning science without teacher, I will have hard time fixing what I should memorize or not, what I should highlight or not and so on.

Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Other think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.	::	<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether people learn better by themselves or with a teacher. Some people may say studying by one's self is much productive means to learn since they have their own styles of learning. <TS><TR>However, as far as I am concerned,</TR> I firmly believe that study with a teacher is more profitable way to study because it saves much time and gives proper assessment.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>For starters</TR>, studying with a teacher benefits students by saving time.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Normally</TR>, there are times when students have some difficulties with solving problems and finding solutions to that. Even with the descriptions of the problem, students occasionally do not understand why the answer is related to the problem. <TR>Thus,</TR> it leads to considerable time for students to grasp. <TR>However</TR>, if students study with a teacher, this time issue can be settled. <EX>According to my firsthand experience, I once had a difficult time when solving math problems by myself, and wasted a significant amount of time to find solutions. <TR>Nevertheless,</TR> I found a tutor who can give me a right solutions with a very detailed steps. <TR>Hence</TR>, I could understand the subject to the fullest and step onto the next material much faster which paved the way for me to gain more knowledge.</EX></SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, study with a teacher is also an effective way to learn since teachers give out the appropriate assessment to students.</MI2> <SI2><TR>That is</TR>, by letting students to realize what is their weak point on the material, they can enhance their overall grades. <EX><TR>To be more specific</TR>, there were two groups in writing class with given topic. One group was evaluated with a teacher on their essay, and the other group was checking mistakes on their own. <TR>Not surprisingly,</TR> the first group with a teacher better performed with their writings when they handed their final draft. This outcome was possible by virtue of teacher's proper evaluation in which students could notice their defects of writing skill, and showed much improvement. <TR>In contrast,</TR> second group who did not get an assessment from teacher did not show any development on the writings because of their limited and objective perspectives.</EX></SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>On the whole, even the jury is still out</TR>, I am consistent with my rationales.

Is it more important to be able to work with a group of people on a team or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.	::	<IN>There are many kinds of people who like work with others or alone. <TR>Of course</TR>, it depends largely on the characteristics of work, with some work accomplished easily with a group of members, otherwise achieved easily alone. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I think that working alone is more efficient to accomplish a job for some reasons below.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First,</TR> if we work alone, we can set a schedule freely without others’ interference.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Of course,</TR> there are few jobs that we can achieve alone, but when the job is well distributed to people independently, this would eventually save time dramatically. <TR>In this case,</TR> members should know their specific role in a job. Once a person exactly knows what he should do for the job, he can schedule and plan about the steps of the job with comfortable mind rather than interfered by others such as supervisors. <EX>According to a survey, one student got a higher score when studying alone, with concentration on what he had learned, than others who study with others. This is because not only they cannot concentrate on studying, but also competitive atmosphere oppresses the students, which cause them to have uncomfortable mind.</EX> Although group members can help what someone is doing, independent job make a person finish the job efficiently in comfortable atmosphere.</SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, since it is difficult to know entirely about group members such as personality of a person, we can get some trouble when we work with others.</MI2> <SI2><EX>The results of group projects, for example, are often highly influenced depending on the members.</EX> <TR>Actually</TR>, there is no “I” in a group. The group members are required to work together as a team. In most cases, <TR>however</TR>, members differ from one another mostly in preference, having different opinion from others. In the case that group members do not cooperate with others and work passively, the group will disband. We often overlook the fact that somebody’s behavior would be same as when he works. <TR>However,</TR> it is not always true.

The best way to truly relax and to reduce stress is to spend time alone.  	::	<IN>Many people believe that the best way to relax and to reduce stress is to spend time with other people such as family or friends. They think people would feel cozy and comfortable if they are surrounded by close people. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I firmly believe that it is very important to spend time by ourselves to relax following two reasons: <TR>First</TR>, majority of stress is actually coming from people around us and <TR>second</TR>, we can do whatever we want when we're alone.</TS></IN>           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, spending time with others is not always an affective way to reduce stress because oftentimes our stress derives from the people around us.</MI1> <SI1>Thesedays we have more chances to meet different kinds of people than past.

Sometime it is fun to meet those people, but it could be tired to fit or get along with them. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I worked as a intern two years ago, I had a boss from India. She was nice person, but had different working style when dealing with projects which makes me feel uncomfotable.

It is more important to choose subjects you are interested in than to choose subjects to prepare for a job or career.	::	<IN>Some people choose subjects just to enhance his career or future's job, while others select their subjects that he is interested in. <TS><TR>In my opinion,</TR> I will choose subjects I am interested in.

A scientist has to share his new discovery with scientists all over the world.  	::	<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether a scientist should share his new discovery with scientists all over the world or not. Some may say scientist should keep the new discovery as private for its country's own prestige. <TS><TR>However</TR>, as far as I am concerned, I belive it is more beneficial when all the scientists from the world share their discoveries because of: further development and not waste of money.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>In the first place</TR>, the primary reason for my opinion is that we can achieve something better. <TR>That is</TR>, by sharing thoughts, ideas, concepts, and discoveries, scientists from all over the world, can collaborate their efforts and achieve greater succuess.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>To be more specific</TR>, malaria is a disease which is well known as a serious disease that cannot be cured easily. <TR>However</TR>, I read an article recently about the topic of 'development of medicine for malaria'.

When Korean scientist, known as Bok Kim, had discovered the first idea about how to successfully lauch the space ship on the moon. <TR>However</TR>, this whole process was operating secretely with governments' financial support from preventing the idea from exposing to other country. <TR>In fact</TR>, in 1969,which was before the period of Bok's success, there was a breakthrough in US about a man named 'Neil A. Armstrong', who firstly succeeded launching on the moon. <TR>Therefore,</TR> all the works and investment of Kim returned as a huge waste, and if he had shared the discoveries with other scientists, he would not have been in such a feeling of despair and loss of money at least.</EX></SI2> <TR>Consequently</TR>, I strongly insist on sharing discoveries.</BO2>  <CO><TR>Take all these reasons into account</TR>, I strongly believe sharing inventions will benefit the scientists in the worldwide  because it will definitely pave the way for the better achievement and not spending excessive money on individual's work.</CO>	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	Great essay.

However, the organization and writing is a little bit sloppy.  Clean it up a bit and you will have an excellent essay.  Try not to use "to be specific" so much - you are not getting much more specific.  You can easily add the sentence without that part.  It will sound fine.  Also, try to make your thesis statement stronger.  You have written in two sentences something that would be much stronger in one sentence only.	//

Exams encourage students to learn.	::	<IN>It is often said that exams helps students to learn.

It is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than doing physical exercises.	::	<IN>It is often said that watching a movie or reading a book is the best way for people to relax. <TS><TR>On  the other hand, in my opinion,</TR> exercising is a better way. There are several reasons to support  my argument so I will limit to the two that I feel are the most related to the topic.<TR> First</TR>,  exercising is a more effective way for people to relieve their stress. <TR>Also,</TR> by exercising, people  can make deep relationship with their friends.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people can feel better relaxation after doing physical activities than just reading a book in a home.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that exercising distracts people from worries and stress. This simple and quick escape from the reality can serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> reading a book can stress people due to its complex and profound contents. <EX>According to a study conducted by the department of education of Seoul National University of Korea in 2007, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in managing academic pressure. Students in Group A exercised regularly and cooperated with each other with playing sports but those in Group B rarely engaged in such activities and just read a book in their rooms. The researcher found that the former group were more satisfied with their school lives than the latter group. <TR>Moreover</TR>, students in Group B were involved in dangerous activities such as drinking and smoking to cope with their stress. This implies that exercising is a more appropriate way to relax.</EX></SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, by playing sports, people can make better relationship which help people to relax themselves.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that while doing physical exercises, people cooperate with their friends and make more communication each other. It is very imperative because modern society is increasingly becoming competitive. <TR>Therefore,</TR> with such relationship, they can feel more relaxation and consolation, which cannot be made by just reading a book. <EX>This reminds me of my story. When I was a high school student, I felt lots of stress and was nervous due to the lack of relationship with my friends. <TR>Thus</TR>, I tried to exercised every day in order to forget about it. When I played a basketball alone, some friends asked me to play together. We could make friendship easily with playing sports and I could solve my problems.

Television destroy communication among friends and family. Do you agree?	::	<IN>There is an argument concerning whether television destroy communication among friends and family. <TR>In fact</TR>, it is true that television takes people's time to  communicate each other. But it doesn't mean a television disturbs communication among family or friend. <TS>I think television helps communications between one's and other's. I will briefly explain some reasons for this in this essay.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1></TR>First of all</TR>, a television can creates many communication topics.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>To explain,</TR> a few years ago there was a very popular audition program named Superstar K. in every Friday night. After this program, there are many opinion's about the program. Some friends who didn't watch the program couldn't participate in talk.</EX> <TR>Also,</TR> in family members, we can talk lots of things with our parents. <TR>Generally</TR>, almost son and daughter doesn't have common communication topic with their parents. <TR>However</TR>, a television can provide a common topic such as teenager crime or game addiction or many things. <TR>Through this</TR>, people can communicate with their parents, so a relationship between people and their parent can get better. In this sense, television can help to communication.</SI1></BO>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, television can develop a relationship among people.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For example</TR>, many students like sports such as soccer. These students often watch soccer game through a television in their school. <TR>From these act</TR>, their friendship can be developed.</EX> <TR>In addition</TR>, a television can gather a family. In modern society many people are very busy. Since they are really busy, they don't have time to meet their family. But some entertainment television programs can gather some families. <TR>Consequently</TR>, some television programs help family gathering and communications. <TR>Thus</TR> watching television is good at communication with family members.</SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>In summary</TR>, I disagree with the statement that television can destroy a family or friend's communication on account of some reasons I mentioned above: not only does the topic providing function that a television has, but it also help to develop about family member's or friend's relationship.</CO>  	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	3	::	4	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	This is a good essay, and it can be a great essay with a few small changes.

So, in your thesis statement, instead of saying "I AGREE that advice from YOUNGER people is more valuable than older people", use the originial idea - "I DISAGREE that advice from older people is better than from younger people."  Finally, try to organize your ideas a little better - the second paragraph gets confusing.

The expression “Never, never give up” means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

As we can often see, people change their mind, way, and goal to calibrate what he can do better.

One can learn about a person from the type of friends that the person has.	::	<IN>There are different opinions among people regarding whether one’s characteristics can be shown through some of friends who he or her has. <TS>Although it is true that people have a tendency to hang out someone who has a similar interest, I totally believe that friends cannot reflect people’s real personality. </TS>In this essay, I will present two possible reasons to support my idea.</IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, as our society is becoming complex, people can have more chances to get involved in a variety of people who have different backgrounds and personalities.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Specifically</TR>, in the past, it might have been possible to see one’s personality through who his friends are since there were only limited groups that people could form as a social network. <TR>However</TR>, today people are likely to have much more various groups of different people and willing to meet someone who has lived entirely different life from themselves. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my brother are usually surrounded by those who always bring books to read and I often see them including my brother enter the library. Some people can expect that my brother is quite inactive and likes sedentary lifestyles. <TR>However</TR>, my brother also enjoys very active activities like playing soccer and basketball. His close friends are kinds of the book worm and they actually do not like running and kicking the ball, but my brother does not want to be involved in only one type of people.</EX> <TR>In this regard,</TR> one’s characteristics cannot be expected easily though who is one’s friends.</SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, with the scientific technology developed, people can watch famous people’s lives and it is much easier to say that they are affected by celebrities on TV rather than their normal friends.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To specify this</TR>, some people argue that peer pressure are very critical aspects that play important roles in developing children’s personalities and behaviors. Though being shown in school, this trend is losing its power and work out less than it used to. Children can be surrounded by TV and Internet everywhere and get information about famous people who they like and imitate. They do not focus on what their friends behave and think because the most important thing to children of today is what famous people said on TV yesterday. <EX>According to the research conducted by one prominent education institute, almost eighty percent of respondents in elementary school answer that they want to mimic the way celebrities who they like behave and talk and some children said that they become happy when they behave like famous people on TV.</EX> <TR>In this regard </TR>, peer pressure is not significant aspect that affect children’s lives.</SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, not only do people tend to be related with groups of various people and get together with different people but also it is not friend who affect people’s behavior or thoughts but famous people on TV who substantially have effects on people’s almost entire aspects. <TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly assert that one’s friends cannot play a critical role in affecting who one is.</CO>	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	3	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	This is a good essay, but it has the same problem that your other essays have: transitions.

People can benefit more from traveling around their own countries than traveling to foreign countries.	::	<IN>For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8000 years, people were constantly curious about other regions that they have not visited; therefore, they choose to travel. Some people prefer to travel around their own countries. <TS><TR>Nevertheless</TR>, I strongly believe that traveling to other exotic countries is much better for to specific reasons: other nations have variety of distinct cultures that cannot be found in people’s own countries and people already know a lot about their own countries.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many different people in many different other regions form different cultures appropriate for the environment they live in.</MI1> <SI1>Unless, people visit the place and experience the cultures cannot be learned or felt. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I have visited the United States about 3 years ago. I thought I already knew enough about the U.S. because of all the indirect experiences from watching American movies and listening to pop songs. Most of the parts were exactly the same as I had imagined, but there were a few cultures they I did not expect. People in the U.S. smiled and said hi to the strangers when they had eye contact. <TR>Moreover</TR>, the most surprisingly, all the drivers drove their cars to the sideways when they heard the siren from an ambulance. It was a mind blowing experience for me. I was not even surprised this much when I have visited the Grand Canyon.</EX> If I only traveled my nation, I never could have experienced such valuable experiences.</SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, long term habitation in one country provides enough information to know approximately everything about one’s country.</MI2> <SI2>The schools teach the history of the country, real life experiences allow one to learn the culture of the country, and the media provides extensive amount of information about the country. With all the knowledge provided and given from the nation, one becomes to know everything about the country. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I have a grandfather who has live in Korea for 85 years. He even has participated in the Korean War. Because he has lived in Korea for a long period he knows everything: the food, forgotten dialects, and the land marks. To the people like him, the trip around country is meaningless. He always says to me; “go experience the world, where you can enjoy unexpected incidents.”</EX></SI2></BO2>  <CO>Traveling has a number of merits and local tour is also beneficial. <TR>However</TR>, people already have abundant knowledge about their countries and they can experience the cultures that cannot be found in their home countries; hence it is better to go on a trip to foreign countries than to their own nations.</CO>   	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	AN A+ essay!

Government should support scientific research even if it does not have any practical purpose.  	::	<IN>Many people say that if there is not any practical purpose, government should stop supporting scientific research. <TS><TR>However, in my opinion</TR>, government should continue with support for scientific research for the following reasons : for one's country to get ready for the future and it has potential power needed.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, how much scientific research done properly may determine the power of the country.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that countries are competing with these scientific knowledge and information as the technology now has developed alot and there are only a few ways to show their power.

It is better to work at the same company for a long time rather than change jobs several times.	::	<IN>There is an argument whether remaining at the same company for a long time is better choice than shifting jobs frequently. <TS>I agree that people should maintain their jobs for a good amount of time for their own good.

The opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people.	::	<IN>A large number of people might assert that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to older people than to younger people. <TS><TR>Contrary to the popular belief</TR>, I agree to the statement that the opinions of celebrities are more important and influential to young people than to older people for the following two reasons: benefiting recruitment, and relieving stress.</TS></IN>                <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the opinions of celebrities are more crucial and influential to young people than to older people as noticing the opinions guarantees success in career.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that the when people listens to the talk of celebrities, they can understand the social issues very effectively because the celebrities usually appears to variety of media and express their thoughts. <TR>Moreover</TR>, as modern society is becoming increasingly globalized and competitive, today’s job markets require a job candidate with such quality to comprehend social issues.  <TR>In addition</TR> as most of young people need to get a job, while older people most likely to already have occupation, the importance and the effect of the opinions of celebrities are bigger to young people. <EX>According to the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2009, the employment interview was the most important component in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent of the final call. The interviewers looked at the job applicant's knowledge and skills, mostly related to social issues such as terrorism or warfare.</EX></SI1></BO1>               <BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, the point of views of famous people is more vital and powerful to younger generation as the views enable younger people to release more stress.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that listening to the opinions can make people to release their stress when the opinion matches with own. And, young people tend to have more stress than older people as they more suffers from recruitment problem, financial problem, and social problems. <TR>Therefore</TR>, young people are more affected by the opinions as they have more stress to let off. <EX>According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2005, there was a significant difference between two groups of people in managing their pressure.

Your reasoning is weak, especially in the second paragraph.  I fail to see the correlation between celebrity opinion and getting a job.  Celebrities may have opinions, but they may not be experts.  A person can easily form an opinion by reading the news and doing research.  Your example does not show that celebrities have any influence on interviews, just that the knowledge a person has does.  In the third paragraph, the argument that listening to celebrities' opinions relieves stress sounds a bit silly. Also, if you are going to make a statement like "young people have more stress than older people," you need to qualify that statement with research or examples.  Otherwise, it is just your opinion. Your layout and organization is good, but it doesn't sound like you know what you're talking about in this essay.  I would think about it a little more.  If you really believe in these points, you need to find more examples and research to convince your audience.	//
Watching movie in the theater is better than watching at home.	::	<IN><TR>Nowadays</TR>, many people emphasize on convenience and pleasure than anything else. <TR>Therefore</TR>, their preferences of movie place might vary greatly depending on the individuals’ perspectives. Some people would apt to watch it at their own place and the others might prefer another location. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, as jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I will choose watching at home with the reasons as follows.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people could have more freedom and less restriction (when) being at home.</MI1> <TR>In other words</TR>, home is more convenient than cinema because people can do things whatever they desire without much concern. <SI1><EX>Take my case as an example. I have strange habit with respect to lying down on the floor or surfing internet while watching films.

Moreover, cinema and home screen render same level of gratification to the viewers with invented technology. <TR>As a consequence</TR>, as verdict may still be out, I strongly disagree with the statement.

When people immigrate, should they adapt to the new country or keep their old customs?	::	<IN>As people have developed the transportation system, people can easily immigrate to another country. Some people may think they should keep their customs for keeping their own spirit and trying not to lose their root. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I strongly believe that people should adapt to the new country for two reasons.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1>One reason is that people can build hearth relationships by adapt themselves to new country.</MI1> <SI1>When people try to get together with other people who came from abroad, there are few conflicts for religious reasons. Thus, these conflicts could be an obstacle for having relationships with other people. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my friends who came from Arab country cannot eat pork. When he worked at the computer company, his boss prefers to have office dinner at the pork restaurant. <TR>Therefore</TR>, when the office dinner be held in pork restaurant, he has to avoid. <TR>As a result</TR>, he hardly gives positive impression to his boss. <TR>For this reason</TR>, keeping customs could affect to have positive relationships with other person.</EX></SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2>The other reason is that people would face with problems with the food.</MI2> <SI1>When people move to another county, one of the main problems is the food.

This is because each of the specialized workers work together, more products are made. It is apparent that company with good team work with others has far more achievements than the company who does not. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, according to Korean Statistics, companies that showed more cooperation accomplished 60% more than the group which did not.</EX> This shows that the company that has the ability to cooperate with each worker has more competitiveness.</SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR> cooperation between each other is significant for doing work with more fun and easily.</MI2> <SI2>As society is getting more complicated, the tasks are getting complicated too. <TR>However</TR>, when people have the ability to cooperate, they will be less stressful. This is because cooperation is the result of social skills of each worker.

Some people say that we go to school and learn what we need in our life; that is called education, but the best education is taught by our parents. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I do not know how to cook even I read a cookbook. <TR>However</TR>, my mother can cook many different foods compared to the book.

Even teachers in school cannot do it. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> most Asian parents are really devoted to their children. They support everything for their children until they got married or after marriage. <TR>Unfortunately</TR>, most of children usually think that telling their experience and support is parents’ duty for themselves.</EX> Parents just want to help us to live better without them.

People are incapable of being satisfied with what they have; they always want what they don't have	::	<IN>It is often said that people are unable to happy with what they have. Some people may be opposed to this statement because being satisfied with the present provides stability and comfort to people. <TS><TR>However</TR>, in my opinion, people tend to try to obtain and achieve new things such as cell phone, degree and new apartment because of motivation and not being far behind.</TS></IN>   <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, desire for new achievement can encourage people to put more efforts in their lives.</TR> <SI1>One significant reason is that fulfilling new goals is excellent motivation for people to be successful. <EX>From my personal experience, when I was in second years in middle school, I was a bored student who isn’t interested in studying. My grade was always far behind other students. In summer vacations, my parents suggest that they will buy new shoes to me that I wanted to buy. This encouraged me to pay more attention in the class by asking questions to teachers, going over every night. <TR>At the end</TR>, my overall scores in mid terms had significantly improved from D+ to A- and I could get my fancy shoes. Thanks to this experience, I become into studying, and entered good university upon graduation.</EX></SI1></BO1>   <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, being pleasant with the present prevents people from high qualified lives.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact since people are over-competitive in a slow economy, staying in one position gives rise to fall behind other competitors. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, one close senior in my university, named Hye Jin, her long dream was to enter Samsung electronics. She made dream come true by joining study group, asking advice to an academic advisor, and preparing for the interview. <TR>However</TR>, since she already achieved her goal, she satisfied with her position by doing nothing. In contrast, her colleagues kept developed their abilities ranging from TOEIC scores to taking online courses at home. <TR>In the end</TR>, she received bad performance evaluation, whereas others got promotion.</EX></SI2></BO1>  <CO><TR>In sum</TR>, I firmly believe that longing for new things is a better choice than staying in the present. This is because it makes a person more passionate and prevents from being behind. <TR>All in all</TR>, the importance of these benefits cannot underestimated to survive in modern society.</CO>  	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	This is an excellent essay!

Art and music class should be required in young children’s school like science and math class.	::	<IN>There is an argument whether young children need to have an artistic experience in school. <TS>I agree that schools should offer Art and music classes and help its students learn to value the arts. It is because the arts allow children to learn two critical skills: thinking originally and relieving academic stress.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the arts can be an effective training method to improve creative thinking skills that are essential for success in learning and success in life.</MI1> <SI1>In Art and music classes, students can learn how to express their own thoughts in their own ways while appreciating and understanding a great painter’s masterpiece or an excellent piece of music; that brings out students’ creativity and originality. Creativity prepares them with the flexible skills they will need in other classes including math and science class. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, Albert Einstein, who contributed so much to science, had a great creativity that he even sat on eggs to hatch them.</EX> <TR>Also</TR>, originality will serve students well when they go out into the world because the world does not need Tom, Dick, and Harry anymore. It needs one specific person incomparable to any. <TR>Moreover</TR>, since learning about the arts require flexibility in thinking and takes a long time, it is good to start when students are young, so that they can expand their thinking capability and think creatively.</SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, enjoying the arts relieve students’ academic stress.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Many distinguished scholars including the above-mentioned scientist, Albert Einstein, who enjoyed playing violin through his life, treasured the arts as a stress reliever, because it refreshed and inspired their minds.</EX> <TR>For example</TR>, when people sing a song or listen to music, the melodies of music banish all other thoughts from their minds, so that they can restart with the fresh ideas after the music is gone. This shows that how effective it is to enjoy the arts as a stress reliever for students.</SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I agree that school should provide quality art education for young student for the reasons I have mentioned above.</CO>  	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	This is the best essay I have read so far.  As far as content goes, you have got a strong argument and you present it very very well.  Excellent work.  Great organization of ideas as well.  I would suggest making your thesis into one strong sentence.  I would also suggest taking out the Tom Dick and Harry comment - it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Try to make this point in a clearer way.  Finally, in your last paragraph, it seems that Einstein is the example, not the explanation about what happens when people play music.  That is your supporting argument.  All in all an excellent essay that was a pleasure to read.	//
Professional athletes do not deserve to the high salaries that they are paid.	::	<IN>There is an argument over whether professional athletes do not deserve to the high salaries that they are paid. <TS>I disagree with the statement that professional athletes should deserve lower salaries than now for two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, famous athletes can provide big enjoyment to millions of people. <TR>Second</TR>, only a few players earn much money after the severe competition.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, millions of people can be happy because of famous athletes</MI1>. <SI1>Some people might say that professional athletes draw too high salaries. <TR>However</TR>, I will give an example to prove why professional players should deserve to the high salaries. An uncertain and unstable economic climate has been dominant across the world for a long time. <TR>Obviously</TR>, almost every part of the world is affected by a financial problem in one economy. <TR>Not surprisingly</TR>, employers always look for better qualified and more experienced workers. This trend forces job applicants to build more job experiences and obtain more job certificates. Colleges and Universities are also expected to train their students better for their future careers with practical job education. Even employed people also lead a hectic life preparing themselves for challenging and difficult tasks. Like this, today’s millions of people are under a lot of stress. <TR>However</TR>, professional athletes can help them to relieve their stress with big joy. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a few years ago, our county got into the semi-final round in the World Cup because of some star-players’ helps. This result drew big enjoyment to millions of people. <TR>Consequently</TR>, they could relieve their stress and better focused on their job.</EX> <TR>Naturally</TR>, nobody complained about the star players’ high payment. This proves that the professional players should draw a high salary since they give big joy to many people.</SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, only a few athletes who experienced fierce competition could get high salaries.</MI2> <SI2><EX>One of my friends is a professional athlete who is paid a lot of money. When he was in middle school, he spent most of his time playing basketball. He even didn’t have time to socialize with other people since he needed to practice a lot to get into the high school which had an outstanding basketball team in the city. After entering the high school, he also needed to compete with many basketball players to be hired by professional basketball team. He could be a professional basketball player after this suffering process. <TR>At that time</TR>, he was an only player who was scouted by the professional basketball team in the city. Most of his friends who played basketball with him gave up becoming professional players due to this tough track or couldn’t be selected by the team due to their relatively lacking skills. This shows that professional players should get high salaries since only a few athletes could get high payment.</EX></SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I disagree with the statement that professional athletes should deserve lower salaries than now for the reasons I have mentioned above. <TR>First</TR>, millions of people can be happy because of famous athletes. <TR>Second</TR>, only a few athletes who experienced fierce competition could get high salaries.</CO>	::	4	::	5	::	4	::	4	::	4	::	4	::	3	::	4	::	4	::	This essay is all right.  The second paragraph assumes far too much about the stressful lives of people without giving much proof.  Also, even though a few star players get an astonishing amount of money, the other professional players still get a pretty big paycheck, even if it isn't as big.  Your argument seems weak to me.  Try to make your thesis statement into one strong statement, and don't just repeat yourself in the conclusion.	//
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should not pay to use public transportation.	::	<IN>It is evident that in our current society government policy has tremendous importance in our current life. Some people think that making public transportation free will cause a huge financial loss for government. <TS>I, <TR>however</TR>, believe that government should make public transportation free for citizens. There are several reasons for me to discuss my arguments so I will limit to the two which I feel are relevant to the topic: the concepts of efficiency and environment.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR> the most important reason for me to think this way is that government will use taxpayer’s money efficiently.</MI1> <SI1>It is imperative for government to allocate and use limited resources in country wisely. <TR>Thus</TR>, it can be said that it is better to make public transportation free because it will increase work efficiency of people who use public transportation. <EX>A recent news report I read on Korea Medical News Network revealed some interesting findings. <TR>Essentially</TR>, people who uses public transportation to work had lower stress level compared to people drive their own car to work. In the study in the article, many people driving their own car claimed that traffic jam causes a lot of stress. <TR>In the result</TR>, they experienced distraction and could not concentrate while they are working. This example clearly shows that government should make public transportation free in order to increase work efficiency. </EX></SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR> another reason which proves my point is that using public transportation will play a significant role in solving environmental problems.</MI2> <SI2>If government make public transportation free, the number of people who drives their own car will decrease. <TR>As a result</TR>, air pollution caused by car emission will be reduced and air will be cleaner.<EX>A really good example can be seen in Pittsburgh, a city in United States. The city made public transportation free to promote clean air in downtown in late 20th century. Individuals happily participated because not only was it free, but also they knew it was for the environment. The number of people who uses public transportation instead of their own car has been doubled. This contributed to reduce greenhouse gas, primary causes of air pollution. This indicates that government should make public transportation free because of environmental issues.</EX></SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>All these things considered</TR>, with the reasons I mentioned above, I believe that I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic.</CO>  	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	Great essay!  This is a very well-defended and well-organized argument.  Please try to turn your thesis statement into one strong sentence.

Many people have a close relationship with their pets. These people treat their birds, cats, or other animals as members of their family. In your opinion, are such relationships good? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	::	<IN>Dogs have been one of human’s closest friends for thousands of years. It is not only that limited to dogs, but birds, cats, and other animals as well. Some people even raise snakes in their houses. <TR>In addition</TR>, when their pets die, people feel sorrow as their parents have died. <TS><TR>Consequently</TR>, having a close relationship with pets allows people to feel stability, not ruined, and gives energy. </TS></IN>           <BO1><MI1> Having a close relationship with pets helps people to feel stability.</MI1> <SI1>People can actually release their stress just by looking at them because pets act cute. <EX>I once saw an article about benefits of having pets. The article said that pets help people to release stress by being friends to humans. <TR>For example,</TR> when a person is in sorrow, pets know that and consulate them.</EX> Everyone might know that it feels like the world is going to end when they are in grief. <TR>However</TR>, it helps a lot when somebody, for instance, it can be dog, cat, bird or anything, stays with them. <EX><TR>Furthermore</TR>, there was a research held by a university to know if pets are influential to a person’s life. They gave dogs, pigs, and cows to children who have mental illness. By playing, feeding, and being friends to each other, the children’s mental diseases were almost alleviated. </EX></SI1></BO1>           <BO2><MI2> People know the value of themselves when they have a close relationship with pets.</MI2> <SI2>This is especially true to some people who are living alone and old. Most of the old think they are old enough and feel ruined. <TR>However</TR>, when they raise pets, they are raising someone who needs their attention. By raising the pets, people can know how valuable people they actually are. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I was in depression when I was in high school. I cried everyday for no reason when I was at home with my dog, and I felt like I am ruined. <TR>However</TR>, whenever I cried, my little dog came to me and played tricks on me. I was really annoyed at first, but by responding to my dog, I thought I must live since someone, my dog, needs me. This is my experience, but I heard about many other people who were in same situation I was in, and overcame with their pets.</EX></SI2></BO2>            <BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, having a close relationship with pets is good for gaining energy.</MI3> <SI3>Usually, the animals we treat as our families are very small. By looking at them, people feel like they are looking at their babies’. Some people who do not like pets might oppose to this idea, but their mind will change if they raise pets. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my family first started to grow my pet, Sky, even though I did not like dogs. My mother did not like it either, but all of my family members except two of us liked it, so we chose to raise her. Before I took her from the pet store, I thought I would have tough life. <TR>However</TR>, it was not. She always encourages me when I am at home and just by looking at her, I could gain energy. This is only in my case, but other people who did not like animals at first but changed their minds by raising them would think as just as I think.</EX></SI3></BO3>            <CO>Animals are best friends to humans. Although animals and humans have different languages and appearances, they can communicate by spirit. People having a close relationship with their pets can have positive impacts on both humans and pets. Pets can live without concerning their predators, like those living in the wild. <TR>In addition</TR>, people can feel stability and would know they are valuable people. Having a good relationship with them also gives energy. To be physically fulfilled, it is better to have a close relationship with their pets.</CO>	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	A well-organized essay with good points and very heartfelt examples.

Parents should not allow their children to watch television so that they can do well at school.  	::	<IN>We, human being, have never had something more influential than television throughout the history. Since its invention, television started to spread out through all over the world, with developing technologies improving its quality. As it influences on the entire world in short period of time, many side effects such as television addiction, violent or sexual contents, and health related problems started to appear, and parents started to worry about their children’s watching television since they are susceptible to television addiction and violent or sexual contents, and it can hamper their school works. <TS><TR>However,</TR> television can be educationally beneficial to children when it is used correctly, so parent should allow their children to watch it.<TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, television has so many educational programs that help children’s learning academic things that are directly related to their school.</MI1> <SI1>Most parents only focus on negative aspects of television, <TR>however</TR>, and if they stop their children watching it, the children will miss many benefits. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, in Korea, there is a broadcasting station called EBS (Educational Broadcasting Station), and it has only educational programs for children and teenagers. Since the lectures in the programs follow the standard school’s curriculum, students can watch them after school. From watching that programs, which are mostly lectures, children will definitely get help in understanding and learning things that are related to school. Additionally, teachers of the programs sometimes can teach watchers better than school teachers since they are more experienced and qualified.</EX></SI2></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, programs like news, scientific documentaries, and debating programs, not directly related to schools’ curriculums though, can increase children’s overall intelligence and can give diverse information.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Before my preschool, even though I could not understand perfectly, I watched so many scientific documentaries that deal with many kinds of studies such as geography, biology, ecology, and sociology. I could get much information and general knowledge about the subjects from watching television, and understood school’s lectures so easily when I entered preschool. <TR>Furthermore<TR>, even now I get many chances to think and learn about politics, and social problems by watching news and debating programs.</EX></SI2></BO2>  	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	This is an excellent essay except for one thing: where is your conclusion?	//
Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.  	::	<IN>Some people think that it is better to stay quiet and keep a friendship by letting a friend make a mistake. <TS><TR>Nevertheless</TR> I strongly believe that the friends should prevent each other from making mistakes even though there is a risk of losing each other, because friends are suppose look after each other, and if a word of advice ruins a friendship then, it would eventually be ruined someday.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, Friends should worry about each other and move forward together in a positive way.</MI1> <SI1>A friend who just let the other friend make a mistake is not a true friend. As Martin Luther King Jr. said “Nothing in the world is more dangerous than the sincere ignorance,” ignoring is not helpful for anybody, especially for a friend. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was in high school, I decided not to go to college and to start to work right after the graduation. Everybody in my class whom I considered as my friends knew about it, but no one said anything about it. <TR>Back then</TR>, I thought I made the right decision. <TR>Yet</TR>, one of my friends from other class has heard my situation and came to convince me to go to college. He said that I can see the bigger world and achieve more if I go to college. I eventually became convinced and now I go to Princeton University and study economics. If it were not for that friend, I may be flipping patties at McDonoald’s.</EX></SI1></BO1>  <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, a friend who turns his or her back because of a sincere word of advice would not stay as a friend for a long time anyway.</MI2> <SI2>A True friend rather feels grateful about the advice and the friendship even strengthens. <TR>To be specific</TR>, according to research conducted by the National Research Foundation of Korea, about 80 percent of the people answered that they want true words from their friends when they are taking foolish actions. <TR>Moreover</TR>, 75 percent of the people said they might feel bad at first, but would thank the friend who has given an advice consequently. <TR>Therefore</TR>, people do not have to worry about destroying their friendship over giving helpful advice.<SI2></BO2>  <CO>Some people do not prevent their friends from making a mistake for some reasons. <TR>Nonetheless</TR>, friends should look after each other in any circumstances and should not be afraid of giving correcting friends because true friends acknowledge advice. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is better to be brave and stop a friend from making a mistake than to let them suffer from making a mistake. </CO>	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	4	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	5	::	Your thesis statement is very strong in this essay!

Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.  	::	<IN>Travel is the best way to refresh one’s mind and soul. By getting to know different places and people, we create memorable moments that will be remembered for the rest of our lives. <TS>Although some people may assert that travel is to have personal time alone, I firmly believe that the trip will be even more enjoyable with a companion.

When I was on a trip to San Diego, I had to wake up early in the morning to see a sunrise since my fellow traveler urged me to.

Many parts of the world are losing important natural resources, such as forests, animals, or clean water. Choose one resource that is disappearing and why it needs to be saved.	::	<IN>I think everything in this world is important. <TR>Therefore</TR>, choosing only one resource depends on personal philosophy about what is the most important. So the resource that I am considering as the most critical one in this world is forest for humanity. I suppose that many of people thinking about this topic may choose forest. I am going to talk my overview about this topic with two reasons.</IN>  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, forest is first and the most important species of 'chain of prey'.</MI1> have you ever heard of 'chain of prey'? <SI1>it means that if A species is disappeared, B species which consider disappeared A species as prey will loose their prey. <TR>Therefore</TR> B species will die as soon as A species is removed. all these explanation about 'chain of prey' is to talk about how important forest is.

Follow the food chain from a tree in the forest to what eats the tree to what eats the animal that eats the tree.  Your current explanation is too general and doesn't really have much to do with the forest at all.

Always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship. 	::	<IN>Some people might think that people doesn't always need to tell the truth depend on the situations. <TR>However</TR> I have different opinion. <TS>I believe that always telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship for the following reasons.</TS></IN>    <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, Once you lose your trust from somebody, it is difficult to restore the faith.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, relationship is like a glass with full of faith: when the glass get break, it's hard to put it back together and impossible to make as same as it is before. <TR>Of course</TR>, a single lie won't break the relationship right away in some special relationship. <TR>However</TR> the lie will make a crack in the relationship and it will eventually break the glass. <TR>Therefore</TR>, there is no acceptable lie when it comes to the relationship because faith is hard to restore to its original state.<SI1></BO1>   <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, relationship is long-term thing not a instant.</MI2> <SI1>Some people might think lying is sometime better than telling truth because it's easier. <TR>However</TR>, like I mention before, relationship is not a instant thing. It's more like long-term thing. If you lie to someone for your convenience, it might feel easier than telling truth but once the lie turn out it will make the situation more worse than you imagine. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, telling truth might be hard to say but it is way better choice if you consider the further future.</SI2></BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, relationship is all about the faith. Some people might think that a single lie are acceptable in some situation but it is not true. It is because even a single lie can break the faith and it is harder to back it originally and also it will eventually make the situation worse in the long-term. <TR>Therefore</TR> I strongly believe that we should tell the truth in any relationship no matter what.</CO>	::	5	::	4	::	4	::	4	::	3	::	4	::	4	::	4	::	4	::	You are saying some good things in this essay, but your arguments would be stronger with examples.

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People behave differently when they wear different clothes. Do you agree that different clothes influence the way people behave? Use specific examples to support your answer.	::	<IN>Some people say that it clothes are not related with people's behaviors. They insist that whatever clothes people wear, they will act according to their own characters.<TS> <TR>However</TR>, I do think that wearing different clothes affects our behaviors for two different reasons. <TR>First</TR>, uniforms make you act in a certain way whatever they are made for. <TR>Second,</TR> different clothes have different materials.</TS></IN>  <BO1><MI1>Uniforms are made for their own purposes, and saparate a certain group from the others.Therefore, people wearing an uniform automatically follow the group they are belonged to.</MI1> <SI1><EX>Let me take my experience as an example. When I was in high school, I had to wear a school uniform. Whenever I was wearing it, everyone could know where I was from and even what my name was, so these eyes made me be careful and behave in the way how students should be.</EX></SI1></BO1>  <BO2>We all know that clothes are made for different purposes and have different materials to serve that purpose. Formal dresses are made for fancy events. They are usually formal and fabulous, but we don't wear these clothes in daily basis; it is hard to feel comfortable in them compared to our pajamas. Although they are not as fancy as formal clothes, there is no clothes as good as pajamas for our bed times. It was reported that the first thing most people do after thay get home is changing their clothes to rest.</BO2>  <CO><TR>In conclusion, at first glance,</TR> it doesn't look like our behaviors are related to what we wear. <TR>However</TR> I strongly insist that our actions are depended on the clothes we wear for the reasons I have mentioned above. When we wear uniforms, we act according to the group that our uniforms indicate, and clothes made out of different materials make us act in different ways.</CO>  	::	5	::	4	::	3	::	3	::	4	::	2	::	2	::	3	::	3	::	This essay needs a lot of work.
