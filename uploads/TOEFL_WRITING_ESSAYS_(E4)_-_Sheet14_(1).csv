examples to support your opinion.",::,"<IN>What do you think of the most important room in your house? <TS>I believe that livingroom is the most important in my house, because it is a place which family meet and we receive guests.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>The livingroom is a place where family meet.</MI1> <SI1>Usually family are scattered during the day time but they meet at livingroom in the night. At livingroom, they watch television or talk to each other or read newspaper. The livingroom play an important part in connecting family. We have many conversations at livingroom. <TR>For instance,</TR> parent ask their children &quotWhat was the best part of the day for you?&quot These questions and answers make family it possible to understand each other very well. <TR>In other words</TR>, I think that livingroom is a rest and conversation place.

<BO2><MI2>The livingroom is a place where we receive guests.</MI2> <SI2>Most of guests are received in livingroom. <TR>For this reason</TR>, I think livingroom is image of a home. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when you visit your friend's house, if his or her livingroom is very clean and all tied up, you think he or she are a diligent person.

2&Some people like doing work by hand. Others prefer using machines. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ,::,"<IN>Using machines have lots of merits like cost and time efficiency and effectiveness. <TS>But I prefer working by hand because that has its own characters. Hand made goods is distinctive, personal, and valuable.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Hand made goods are different from the manufactured products.</MI1> <SI1>Every piece is distinctive. If you look at the hand made pottery, each one has it’s own character and personality. Even though some might be little irregular in shape, those become a charm to the pottery. Manufactured pottery, uniform in shape and less expensive, is not unique.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Made by someone, not some factory, make the goods personal.</MI2> <SI2>Specially made by somebody you love, it is priceless. I have children who love making cards and notes for me and other people they like. Sometimes their creation doesn’t look good like store bought, but that is very special for me.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>Working by hand is time consuming job.</MI3> <SI3>In modern society, time is money. A person put his valuable time in the process of making, which can be done by the machine in no time. That makes the hand made goods more valuable than manufactured ones.</SI3></BO3>

<BO1><MI1>In museums of the new place, we can experience many things that we cannot have in our hometown.</MI1> <SI1>Some museums provide not only things that we can see, but also things that we can touch or smell or etc. <EX>Science museum can be a good example.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, travelers visit the museums for enjoying unfamiliar culture.</MI1> <SI1>Many, if not most, museums have their own unique programs to offer their visitors like imitation antique parlor, birtual faculty for being a ancestors or custome event like traditional fashion show.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, travelers go to the museum in order to know the culture of visiting country for short time.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In general</TR>, history is the fastest way to know presence. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, Museum is the house where have the representative collections of the country’s history. <TR>Thus</TR>, going museum is easy way to know what cultural basis the country have. <EX><TR>Actually</TR>, I have several European friends who study Korean language and culture.

gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why? ",::,"<IN>Two very common ways of gaining knowldges are through books and experinces. Many people argue about in choosing the better method. <TS><TR>In my point of view</TR>, i prefer books to experience.</TS> There are some reasons for it.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, books contain greater amount of knowledge.</MI1> <SI1>Books are based on personal life, scientific facts, fantasy and so on. <TR>In contrast</TR>, gaining knowledge through experience may be applicable, but limited; for you can't experience everything contained in books. <TR>Therefore</TR> gaining knowledge through books is more efficient.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, there are knowledges that can only be acquired through books such as geographical and historical knowledge.</MI2> <SI2>Our life span and is short. <TR>Thus</TR>, travelling every single place on the earth is impossible.

"6&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts.

Some people think that relacing and enjoying a good novel is a waste of time. <TR>Instead</TR>, they firmly believe that beneficial reading only comes from nonfictional works. <TR>Unfortunately</TR>, the poeple who believe this to be true don't understand the importance of novels. <TS><TR>In fact</TR>, fictional works affect people in many different ways.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, fiction can stimulate one's imagination and creativity.</MI1> <SI1>People can dream of new world by reading fiction. That can link to innovational invention. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one person had thought about going to the moon.

It makes it sound like you really know what you are talking about.  
There are a few organizational things that need to be addressed as well. Your introduction is excellent, but you are missing a thesis statement.  The thesis statement is meant to summarize what you are going to talk about. Ex. &quotI believe fiction is important because it stimulates creativity, which leads to innovation.&quot My only other complaint is that you use a lot of transitions for a short essay.

7&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Grades(marks) encourage students to learn. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN>I think that people who consider grades as negligible sections of a student’s life have a bad choice. <TS>I agree that grades encourage students to learn.</TS> <MI1>In many colleges or universities, lots of students do a lot of homeworks enthusiastically, study hard for tests, and really want to advance their grades. So grades encourage students to concentrate on their lectures and to prepare hard for their examinations.</MI1> <MI2>Finally grades let students have great and enthusiastic campus lives.</MI2> Following is my specific ideas to support my opinion about a grade’s effects on a student’s studying.</IN>

<BO1><SI1>To get better grades, students concentrate on their lectures. <TR>Sometimes</TR>, they participate in their lectures, announce presentations, or ask questions to their professors. In this process, they get not only much better grades but also more information about their major subjects.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2>Many students worry and are scared by a variety of exams. <SI2>From a quiz to final exam, students prepare to their tests by studying their subjects. The reason they prepare for exams is to get better grades. And sometimes by being on Dean’s list, they have confidence in their abilities to study well. <TR>In contrast</TR>, if colleges regard grades or marks as a negligible part of campus life, student will not study hard for their lectures or exams. <TR>Consequently</TR>, they will have less knowledge about their majors in this atmosphere than otherwise.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In this passage</TR>, I explain why students need to get certain grades and how grades encourage students to study. Because of grades, marks, or scholarships, many students show great diligence in their campus lives. <TR>For instance</TR>, they concentrate on their lectures and prepare hard for their exams. <TR>In conclusion</TR>, I think it is evident that grades encourage students to learn and grades and scholarships are essential parts of school.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,4,::,2,::,4,::,2,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,"This essay really needs some organization.

It could be because of their desires to get highly educated or to gain new experiences. <TS>But among all these reasons I think the most critical reason is because people are wanting to get lucrative jobs.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To exemplife this</TR>, more and more students are enrolling economics, business and law courses.</MI1> <SI1>This is because these courses will help them to attain high paying jobs in the future.

<BO2><TR>However</TR>, the popularity in courses such as chemistry, geology and ethics are decreasing because they lead to those jobs, which make one to study alot but with less profits. If this gets worse, our society might not have people like geologist and chemist but only lawyers and businessmen.</BO2> 

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, many people if not all, are wanting to get highly educated to get lucrative jobs.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the award and prize give him or her wealth.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, the Novel Prize or Pulitzer Prize is useful in many case because it give him or her vast wealth, social status, and international fame. <TR>In fact</TR>, the Novel Prize, which divided into five fields, physics, chemistry, medical, peace and literature, gives to only one man every year.</EX> <TR>Furthermore</TR>, the awards given by Olympic or Physical competition also enable athletes to acquire the rewards.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, the man or woman who receive awards are able to warrant the social status.</MI2> <SI2>If the man or woman receive the famous and powerful prize, he or she become famous.

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, he or she can feel happy.</MI3> <SI3><TR>As a matter of fact</TR>, the people who receive prize are able to feel pleasant first.

<BO1><MI1>In the former days people usually passed down their jobs to their children.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Therefore</TR>, it would have been easy to teach their children how they needed to act. <TR>However</TR>, the jobs have become more complicated these days and people don't usually follow what their parents did and do.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, not all students have the same abilities for acquiring some knowledge.</MI1> <SI1>It might be hard for some poor students to follow the higher education. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one high school in South Korea, some classes are divided into three classes by teachers : high class, middle class, and low class.

<BO1>There are several reasons for reading books to lean something. <MI1><TR>First</TR>，the topics which books can deal with are vary whereas what we can actually experience is very limited.</MI1> <SI1>We read books to enjoy or to go through things we cannot possibly experience in a real world.</SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, I have enjoyed reading books in the library.</MI1> <SI1>Since childhood, I liked reading books due to the influence of the fact that my father was a novelist.

I was totally amused by the incidents and people of ancient and modern world, therefore I traveled many countries around the world. Since I could check out the history books for a month, I usually carried them out during my trip to other countries.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, students usually have no choice to select in courses.</MI1> <SI1>They just take classes 
what they are given, even when they do not want to take them. In these class, 
generally, students don't pay attention to teachers or do other things which are not 
related to the class. They can't think of any motive by themselves. I think the most

their mind to what they want to do, and need to do. Of course, some unexpected

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a good neighbor is a person who provides a sense of family in the community.</MI1> <SI1>These days because cities have become complex, apathy prevails. Even some people don't know who live in a next door, and it is why people feel solitude in a multitude. To be a good neighbor, we have to pay attention to people in the community as family and help them. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> there is a program as &quotThe Neighborhood Watch&quot. Through &quotThe Neighborhood Watch&quot, many of the residents of a neighborhood form an organization that lookout any strange happenings in the neighborhood.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, a good neighbor have to respect other's privacy.</MI2> <SI2>In the past of our country, neighbors are so close that it causes invasion of privacy.

"201& It has been said, &quotNot everything that is learned is contained in books.&quot 
Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important?

They gain knowledge through expreiences and from books. <TS><TR>As for me</TR>, knowldege gained through experiences is more important than that from the books, because knowledge gained from experiences could give the unlimited and explicit knowledge.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, gaining the knowledge from experiences is no limited to any condition.</MI1> <SI1><TR>However</TR>, books has some limits that books are available only to anyone who are able to read and write. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when we teach the language babies, we do not give a baby books.

239&Some high schools require all students to wear school uniforms. Other schools permit students to decide what to wear to school. Which of these two school policies to you think is better?,::,"<IN><TS>I firmly believe that students must wear the school uniforms. Even though it interferes the students' freedom of choosing clothes, wearing school uniforms offer two significant advantages.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, school uniforms bind a school's students together spiritually as well as apparently.</MI1> <SI1>When people see those students wearing same clothes, they easily figure out that they are in same school. <TR>Further</TR>, the students themselves can notice students in their school any time outside of the school. Why is this important? I think it is important because it gives them a sense of unity. As one who is abroad feels patriotism when he sees his national flag, a student feels particular love toward his school when he sees someone wearing the same school uniform that he is wearing. If students wear whatever they want to, they wouldn't be able to feel that kind of feelings, which is very important for the development of the school. </SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, school uniforms relieve those who cannot buy as many as clothes other students can buy.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Everyone in a school do not have enough money.

Surely, not everyone will feel a sense of inferiority only because they can't afford nice shoes and expensive clothes. <TR>However</TR>, we can often see those who steal money to buy better clothes just because they want to have good clothes or bags that their friends have. We need to prevent that kind of situation as much as possible. I am certain that school uniform will help decrease a sense of inferiority. School uniforms will help students make their friends with no regard with their wealth as well.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, we can learn from advertisements a sense of fashion which can enrich our lives.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, during the 2002 Korean Japan World Cup I watched the advertisements about the red shirts and clothes which included the Korean flag. <TR>For a while</TR>, I realized that many peple supported for Korean team in red.

259&How do movies or television influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.,::,"<IN><TS><TR>I think that</TR> movies or television may substantially influence people's behavior. <TR>First of all</TR>, in order to argue my thought, it must be assumed that movies or television are more preferred to other mass media or book in killing time and enjoying everyday leisure time easily.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>My opinion can be bolstered by the fact that people usually tend to imitate a movie star or a popular talent whom they really like.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Generally speaking</TR>, movies, or melodramas and advertisements of television program usually create the vogue of life style. This vogue is directly related to the behavior of purchasing the specific commodity. The following explanation shows how the vogue of life style created artificially in movies or television can result in the behavior of purchasing the specific commodity. Sponsors or advertisers cast the popular movie star or the famous talent and order them to advertise their commodities covertly, so the performance of the popular movie star or the famous talent may reflect their intention. <TR>Eventually</TR>, this mean that sponsor or advertiser can manipulate and control the life style of people who want to resemble the popular movie star or the famous talent.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2>Smoking may be the representative example which can explain this process properly.</MI2> It is convinced that smoking is absolutely harmful to health. <SI2>But if primary actor's smoking in movies or dramas of television is seen to be splendid, people who want to resemble the popular movie star or the famous talent is apt to smoke despite knowing the fact that smoking is absolutely harmful to health. <TR>Adversely</TR>, if the story of a popular movie or melodrama is that a man's smoking cause his children or wife to have the lung cancer and result in the break of the family, even a chain-smoker may seriously think about the smoking effect to his family and make an effort to stop smoking. <TR>There is one more example.</TR> <EX>We remember that movie star, Rock Hudson conceded himself to be AIDS patient and warned us not to have incongruous sexual intercourses in television a few years ago.

<CO><TR>In sum</TR>, It can be concluded that movie or television can influence people's behavior whether positively or negatively. The reasons can be summarized in two aspects.

260&how do movies or television influence people 's behavior? use reason specific examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>Now days, we are contacted with many kinds of media. <TS>Typical media are both movie and TV. They influence our behavior in usual life. Movie or TV is giving some advantages and disadvantages to ours. I tell this next.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, movie or TV influences good effects to our behavior.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, 10 years ago, I watched TV which program name is “The success people”: contents about success people’ story until they stand their position.

The reasons why academic interest is the most strong motivation to attend college or university are two.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the establishment purpose and the function of college or university are most closely related to academic interest among other factors.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, internet addresses of colleges or universities almost include 'edu' meaning education or 'ac' meaning academy. This shows indirectly what the establishment purpose and the function of college or university are.</EX> <TR>Second</TR>, besides satisfying students' academic interest, college or university can provide students with interesting experience through various circles, membership with many alumni and information useful to career preparation, but never provide students only with these secondary advantages without satisfying students' academic interest. Because the prime purpose of college or university is to satisfy people who decides to attend college or university due to academic interest. To attend college or university due to academic interest may add some advantages to career preparation but career preparation is not much related to attending college or university. <TR>In other word</TR>, this means that career preparation which does not require academic interest or increased knowledge in college or university may not give people the motivation to attend college or university. And if career preparation requires academic interest or increased knowledge in college or university, the motivation to attend college or university also should be academic interest, although people's ultimate purpose is to get a job after graduation.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2>There are two examples which can explain the reason why the academic interest is more considered than other factors.</MI2> <SI2><EX>First is the various humanities and social science majors, occupying the average 50% of all majors which the respective colleges or universities provide. Many people continued attending college or university in order to study humanities and social science even though these majors provide relatively less opportunities to get a job than other majors.</EX> This shows that many people's decision makings to attend are matched to academic interest. <EX><TR>On the other hand</TR>, the careers which warrant good pay and more opportunities to get a job also require the academic interest and increased knowledge related to the careers in most cases. So this also means that even many people who decide to choose popular major in order to get a good career, seriously must consider their academic interest.</EX> <TR>Secondly</TR>, as most of all counselors point out, the decision making of attending only due to other advantages without considering academic interest can result in losing the precious opportunity cost in each people's life. Because college or university provide the advantages and information useful to the people who primarily consider their academic interest or increased knowledge.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In sum</TR>, it can be concluded that academic interest may be the most strong motivation among many factors to be considered. The reasons to this conclusion are two. First is the basic function and the prime purpose of college or university for satisfying people's academic interest. Second is that the advantages which college or university provides besides increased knowledge can be much more useful to people who primarily consider academic interest than people who don't primarily consider academic interest. And The examples supporting these reasons are two. First is many people continuing to choose the relatively more difficult majors like humanities and social science majors in getting a job.

"271&Do you think private companies, where they make pollution, have to pay more money for cleanup action?

Some people may argue that private companies should take more responsibility for the pollution, because they make more money at the cost of messing up the environment. <TS><TR>I think</TR>, <TR>however</TR>, there is no reason to demand more money from the private companies, because of the two facts : the principle of equity and the bad effect on economy. </TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, it is unfair for only private companies to pay more money for the cleanup.</MI1> <SI1>In the sense of civil and criminal rights, one should not be blamed for the result which he or she does not make. If the private companies should pay additional money only because of the fact that they generally make a lot of money, it is some kind of discrimination. All private companies are not always responsible for the pollution. Recent development of technology has brought about new environment-friendly companies which do not contaminate the surroundings at all. <TR>Besides</TR>, consumers and public companies are sometimes the cause of the pollution : diffusing car gases and pollutants into the air. <TR>Therefore</TR>, Demanding the private companies to 
spend more money for clean is against justice.</SI1></BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, it makes the economy unstable.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In general</TR>, private companies tend to seek more money from their products, so they are likely to raise the price as possible as they can.

If the company want to succeed in what they do, the first thing they must keep is strong motivation for the purpose.</SI1></BO1>

"306&It has been said, &quotNot everything that is learned is contained in books&quot Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important.",::,"<IN>There are a number of ways in learning something in our lives. When it comes to the best way for that purpose, some may choose an indirect method, such as reading books or listening to others' talk, because they can save time and energy. <TS>I think, however, personal experience is better way, since it is a definite method and we can learn a lot from it.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we can learn something well through personal experience.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In general</TR>, we can get a broad range of knowledge by reading books, however, such knowledge is only located in our brains and sometimes useless. <EX><TR>When I was young, I tried to learned how to swim so I bought a guide book and mastered it utterly. <TR>In spite of such effort</TR>, I could not swim at all. <TR>So</TR>, I joined swimming class and after numerous trials and errors, I finally got to know how to swim.</EX> <TR>As that incident vividly illustrates</TR>, hands-on experience can make us master something.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, we can get a lot of lessons by personal experience.</MI2> <SI2><TR>As a rule</TR>, we have read a lot of books about good personalities, such as willingness to accept responsibilities, however, we are less likely to get and practice those traits. because of the lack of chances for them.

Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country?

Some people would like to make a agriculture research center, while others want to erect a business center. <TS><TR>In my case</TR>, I highly recommend that we should build a business center because we can import the crops at less cost and we can earn more money when we do business.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, economically importing the agricultural products is more beneficial than to raise some plants here.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In Korea</TR>, there are many mountains. <TR>In other words</TR>, there are few farms.

<BO2><MI2><TR>What's more</TR>, agriculture research center study keeping the soil and water from pollution.</MI2> <SI2><TR>Generally</TR>, soil and water is involved to people's health directly.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the subway is always on time, so you don't have to worry about being late.</MI1> <SI1>Think about driving your car to get somewhere.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Above all</TR>, right emotions can be built by studying art and music.</MI1> <SI1><TR>General speaking</TR>, students who studied art and music have right emotions and stability in mind than who did not. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my freinds has played piano since he was eight years old.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we can develop our intelligence from playing games.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In general</TR>, if we are to play with others and to defeat them, we have to make a good strategy and apply it to the games properly. <TR>Therefore<TR>in the course of playing games, we are likely to advance our abilities and become more clever. I have learned korean chess from my father in my childhood and played with others numerous times. <TR>Since the situation in korean chess is so diverse and complicated</TR>, I have developed my ability to predict and confront future situation. <TR>As that experience vividly illustrates</TR>, playing game can make us more intelligent.</SI1></BO1>

I have been in study-group in college and group members used to play basket ball. <TR>Through the team-play</TR>, I have learned some priceless lessons : willingness to accept the responsibility and a mind for fair play.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, no one denies the fact that there are, of course some bad games, such as gamblings and lottery games and they can hardly give any lesson about life.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we can make something ours completely.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In general</TR>, when we learn something, we may read the article about that or we may consult friends and family members about that.

<BO1><MI1>The most important reason is that having close relationship with someone who has quite different taste and not agreeable personality gives us a chance to know about ourselves.</MI1> <SI1>It might not be easy to keep company with someone quite different from ourselves. In this relaionship, we come to find more disagreement and discord than agreement and accord. We might quarrel over what kind of movie to go to see or what to have for lunch.

347&Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and should spend most of their time on school studies. Others believe that young children should spend most of their time playing. Compare these two views. Which view do you agree with?

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the other hand</TR>, there could be disadvantageous for children to lose their heyday.</MI2> <SI2>If parents push them to study hard, children are likely to lose their interests on their jobs, studying. The study is not fun any more to them. I am sure that chilren who must go school in the early morning are definitely under stress. <TR>Moreover</TR>, another negative impact is that children cannot play with other people. <TR>As you know</TR, a sense of cooperation is essential to do social lives in adult's lives. I believe that the best time to learn these thoughs are in childhood while playing game with their friends. <TR>For these reasons>/TR>, I highly recommend that parents should consider seriously before deciding on the children's early study. </BO2>

<BO1><MI1>Music and art can be good means to help students study other subjects.</MI1> <SI1>Art has been a main subject used from ancient times to teach students, because it was believed that most studies were related each other.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a decisive element for the sum of money depends on the rareness of the talent which individuals have.</MI1> <SI1>Let’s compare two career white color office workers commonly found in a job market and accountants that have such a specified skill.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a zoo has a great influence on the learning of children.</MI1> <SI1>Precisely it works as an actual learning field in which the young people’s studying is taking place. The young hear the crying of animals, see the nature and numerous colors, touch not a doll but an actual organism and depict what living creatures like elephants, lions and etc. look like and display outspoken idea that how kids themselves feel about them. Even young learners stand the ample chances of feeding the animals in the zoo. Information learned is firmly set by the engaged context by and large. <TR>In this way</TR>, outting to the zoo means kids have an effective biology class.</SI1> <TR>In short</TR>, going to the zoo and accumulating experiences with live animals and nature would bear so good learning result that the zoo must exist in a local community. </BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, the zoo offers the place that people take rests.</MI2> <SI2>In industrialized society, a great deal of green and woods have been absent for decades. <TR>As a result of that</TR>, there are not many places for all the family members to refresh their tired body from a work or school. In the zoo, not only are children allowed to be exposed to the nature and animals but also parents can relax on grass. <TR>In addition</TR>, some zoos have amusing rides and program a kind of show like dolphin show which is unquestionably a unique experience.</SI2> <TR>Thus</TR>, both children and parents have fun and can appreciate the leisure time in the zoo. <TR>In this sense</TR>, a zoo functions as a useful place for the regional people. </BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR> two reasons I back up that a zoo achieves meaningful purposes, the formal is that a zoo is utilized for the growing young to give a contextulized learning environment which will spur their senses. The latter is that members of family altogether enjoy their precious relaxation hours at the same time in the zoo.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"The author organized a balanced and well written approach to write this essay.

401&Teacher should be paid according to their students’ performance.,::,"<IN>As teacher gradually plays an important role in the education of children, many people insist that teachers who make students get good grades should be gotten paid more. They believe that this measure fairly improves the school system and result in cultivating better students. <TS>In my opinion, however, it is a ridiculous way to change the school and cause negative outputs.</TS> There are several bases for why I agree with this perception and I want to delve into some of the significant ones here.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the trial to pay more according to students’ score makes teacher forget their genuine role.</MI1> <SI1>Once that measure is executed, teachers will strongly force all students to study hard to get better results on tests. Even though there are students who want to be athletes, painters or musicians and these jobs largely do not need to be good at studying, teachers oppress with study.
The most important role for teacher is to encourage students to find what they want to do and help them achieve their dreams, but the measure prevents teachers from doing their own roles. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a high school student, my school paid more to the teachers who led students to get good grades on test. Although our baseball team was famous in the city with regard to its level, players had to accomplish a certain level of grades and this brought about the lack of a practice. <TR>Finally</TR>, they failed to get the champion at the tournament in the city again. This manner definitely keeps teachers from developing students.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, because students’ scores cannot prove the abilities of teachers, the way is unfair and improper.</MI2> <SI2>That is because the subjects that each teacher deals with are very different and its difficulty is also not same. That means students get different grades according to subjects on average. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, while most of the students get low grades on math test, they usually get good scores on language or sociology. So, if we introduce the new policy, it will become unfair to some teachers. They may even try to make exam easy for better students’ grades to reap more profits and this will degrades school’s quality. In this regard, this measure cannot provide reasonable salary for teachers.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, this paying system discourages teachers to fulfill their real role and gives them unfair salary. Judging with grades is uncomfortable and stressful to the teachers as well as students. We had better focus on more substantial factors than superficial results to advance school system and education.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Good essay!

402&Students can study more effectively if they do project in a group,::,"<IN>Some people say that students can study more effectively if they do project in a group. <TS>Personally, I strongly agree with the opnion for the folloning two reasons. <TR>most of all</TR>, students can collect a variety of important information more easily from goup studies.</TS> <TR>In addition</TR>, they can make better decisions by sharing their opnions.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, a goup study is benefical to get useful information more easily by sharing tasks with study members.</MI1> <SI1>Of course, studying alone can achieve a desirable result in thier academic perfprmance. <TR>However</TR>, the process is limited to collect data and search for a variety of information in that an individual should collect all of the required information in the designated time. <EX>Let me take my experience for example, when I was a university student, I had to seach for a substantial amount of data to do an assignment related with a neuroplastcity in a neuroscience class. Most of the sudents in the class had trouble gathering informaion because the assignment was too difficult and intricated to take it individually.<TR>Consquently</TR>, the professor was disappointed with the results of students’ assignment, so he made some groups in which students took part. He changed the assignment from an individual project to a goup project. We could choose a divided part of the project and got a diversity of useful information. After doing the project, all of the students could realized the effect  and importance of the group study. In this regard, studying in a group is benefical to make good results by collecting  useful information in a short period of time.</EX></SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, students can find a decisive idea to solve complicated problems  by discussing  together.</MI2> <SI2>Of course,  group studies tend to be  controlled  by a leader to make the right decision. <TR>However</TR>, students can make the right decision through member’s diverse opinions. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> I had to regularly take part in the discussion  about the quality improvements of our work place. It was hard to make appropriate subjects and processes, and thus I and my co-workers had to spend amount of time and effort  making a good decision. At the begining of the discussion, we couldn’t find appropriate ways. As time goes by, we used to dramatically make significant aehievements by sharing differnt opinions. In this sense, students can solve any intricated problems by discussing together.</EX></SI2></BO2>

 <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>,  studying in a group has a benefical influence on students’ academic performances. This is because they can take useful information more easily by dividing their roles and make a good decision by discussing together.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Good essay!

405&Most people can solve their important problems on their own and with their families.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, parents have a wealth of experience in many aspects of life, and are thus able to provide practical assistance to their sons and daughters.</MI1> <SI1>As parents have accumulated their own know-how in their careers or lives, they have many resources and skills with which to teach and guide their sons and daughters. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my parents helped me to solve my problems when I was first started working at a motor company.

406&imagine that there is a plan to build a new motion picture theater in your community. Do you favor or oppose this plan? why? use specific examples and reasons to support your opinion.,::,"<IN><TS>I oppose above opinion that a new motion theater is built in our community.</TS> Building a new motion theater can cause a traffic problem. In addition, people in our society already have many different leisure activities. <TR>Therefore</TR>, constructing a new theater will be waste of resources. Now I explain why building a new motion theater should not be fulfilled.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, I know that the plan will cause a traffic congestion in our society.</MI1> <EX><SI1>Since there are some researches that conducted by study groups. The research mentions that opening of theater gives rise to significant traffic congestions. It shows that one example. In October, one theater opens in Junju. But it has not enough parking lots and access roads. <TR>Consequently</TR>, people who want to go theater park their cars on streets and Police officers appear to solve that problem.</EX> <EX>Another survey prove that making theater arouse 30% higher traffic inflow in society. When one community that has 3 hundred thousand populations builds a new theater, they gather more than thirty -thousand visitors in a month. It tells us that thirty thousand visitors can drive to community. <TR>Therefore</TR>, we always consider that the project will be the main culprit of traffic problem.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Second reason</TR>, to oppose the plan is that “Why should a new motion theater be built in our community?”</MI2> <SI2>Our society has many leisure programs such as sports, mountains, shopping center and already has one normal theater. Today, a lot of people spend spare time and they also have various pastimes. They spend the time to ascend mountains and visit friend’s house. But they don’t always want to visit the motion theater. Indeed we have already normal theater and it still fine.<EX> <TR>For example</TR>, my family enjoy watching movies. But we don’t want to see the movie in a motion theater in that it is uncomfortable and sometimes can be disgusted since it shakes people. Also the motion theater movie ticket is more expensive than ordinary movie’s. <TR>Eventually</TR>, my family don’t spend more money to be shaken when watching movie.</EX> Though the motion theater can be a good choice, many people don’t wish to go that. If the common theater that we have already gotten did not be in our community, many people would consent the project. <TR>However</TR>, we own the theater and motion theater is not essential.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, it is not necessary for us to build a new motion theater. We have better different alternatives. The problems that I said above statement don’t happen as we decide not to implement the plan. <TR>Consequently</TR>, I firmly disagree the project to build a new motion theater in our community.</CO>

407& Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion?,::,"<IN>One of my friends has one motto in his life, that is, 'Carpe diem.' That means, we have to enjoy our life whenever it is possible. Following this motto, my friend consumes his money as much as he can if he has it, so he does not have any savings account. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with his life style and firmly believe that we should save money for some time in the future.</TS> And my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, we have to prepare our future properly by accumulating some money in our accounts.</MI1> <SI1>In other words, we need money to pursue our dream and prepare for turning-point in our life. If we just spend money we have at once, we cannot make our truly important things come true. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I am a high-school student in small county in South Korea. Although I live in a rural place, I have a big dream, to become a doctor and to buy a good house in the big city. It requires a lot of money. If I do not think about my future and real crucial things that I want to have, it is all right for me to spend my small money right away. <TR>But</TR>, it will be certainly regretful when I reach at the age that I really need some money to become a doctor and buy a good apartment, as I will not have any money at that time due to my inconsiderate behavior. It would be better to save my money for my future, even though I have to sacrifice the pleasure moment of the present, as it helps me to pursue my real hope in my life.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, as we may run into some unexpected accidents, it is wise to hoard our money.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it another way,</TR> we need to save some money because we human are not totally rational and cannot expect all of the happenings in the future. In economics terms, savings for the future from this reason are referred as 'precautionary motive savings,' and it explains a valid reason why it is clever for people to have savings account. <EX>According to a study conducted by a well-known professor in Tokyo University, those who spent less than average people by 20% were more likely to prepare for some unexpected accidents, such as cancer and car crashing. They could afford their fee for hospital and live a longer and happier life by the help of their savings. This example clearly supports the view that we need to save some money for our bright future.</EX></SI2></BO2>
<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, I recommend everyone in our society to save some money, compulsorily by government if it is possible, for it can help us to pursue our true dreams and prepare for some tragedies. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I think 'Carpe diem' should not be interpreted as a word that supports we should spend money as much as we can, but as a phrase that leads us to live faithfully, by seeing over the present.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Good essay and well organized.

408&what are some characteristics of good supervisor at work?,::,"<IN>When it comes to requirements of a good supervisor, some people may argue that a good supervisor needs to get variety of skills, such as leadership, patience, etc. <TS><TR>however</TR>, I have a different idea. I strongly believe that it is important that the best supervisor trust in and respect for his or her employees.</TS> There are two reasons for my position.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the trust between supervisor and employees is necessary for them.</MI1> <SI1>It is known to be true that when they are trusted, people feel happiest and work efficiently. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, suppose that there was a theft in my company and I was there when it happened. Some supervisors would ask about that situation directly and may not believe me. <TR>As a result</TR>, I could not work in the company together, but if supervisor write me an e-mail and note that demonstrates his or her trust in me first, and ask me for some insight into the issue so I will not be embarrassed and don’t have to quit my job.</EX> As a famous proverb say, “Trust is an emotional glue”.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, a good supervisor respect for his or her co-workers.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In general</TR>, some supervisors think that only employees or lower-grade co-workers have to receive order and dictation. This is old-date idea. Respecting each other is more powerful than only ordering in attachment. <EX>The recent study by the Stanford Research Institute shows that even though over 80 percent of employees who have been respected form their supervisors want to continue to stay in workplace, about 30 percent of employees who did not feel such emotion do. According to the study, what supervisors respect for his or her employees is effective for making attachment. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, the research explains that supervisors who show respect in their employees could make their company happy.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, young people can find what kind of job is appropriate to them by experiencing diverse jobs.</MI1> <SI1>It is necessary for them to select  an appropriate  job to which they can devoted themselves with happiness. This is because such a desirable and satisfied job make them happier.  <EX>Take my closest friend for example, he worked  at a big construction company after graduation from his university witout any experience of other job fields. <TR>However</TR>, he always complained about his hard work and unsatisfied taskes in his company.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, a variety of job experiences help them to achieve  better results in their job.</MI2> <SI2>Nowadays, a diversity of  jobs is becoming more and more complexed than before. However, the interrelationship between jobs is also becoming intensified.  <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is hard to make sucessful results with one job experience.   <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my co-worker had an additional job experience before working in our company.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, if we leave the environment being polluted, we have to not only spend enormous money, but also exert infinite endeavor to recover our nature.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To be specific</TR>, environment is so complex and broad that once a balance is broken, it is very difficult to make it to the original state.

Some people may think that playing with many people is more fun and pleasure than paly with a few friends. <TS>In my opinion, <TR>However</TR>, playing with a few friends is better because it is hard to spend enjoyable time if there is many friends and it is more easy to conservate more private conservation with a few friends.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, spending a enjoyable time with a many friends is impossible.</MI1> <SI1>This is because it there is many people, it is too noisy and also it is too confused.

415&It is more important for students to understand concepts and ideas than to learn facts.,::,"<IN>It is evident that in our currently society, learning is an tremendous importance in our lives. Some people think that it is more important for students to understand concepts and ideas, while others do not. <TS>I, <TR>however</TR>, believe that it is more important for students to learn facts.</TS> There are several reasons that I discuss to support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. <TR>First</TR>, it is very efficient. </TR>Also</TR>, it is not receive a lot of stress.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important for my feeling this way is that learning facts can save a lot of time. In commonly society, time is very important in our lives.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Thus</TR>, it can be said that if students learn facts, they will get a lot of information faster because they do not spend time to understand ideas. <EX>Take my sister, for example. Her major is physics. She saved a lot time to study final exam because he always learned facts without understanding concepts. It only took her 2 days to finish studying final exam. <TR>However</TR>, it took over a week for her friends. This difference can be attributed to the fact that most concepts of physics was difficult to understand. As this experience clearly shows that it is more efficient to learn facts because students can save a lot of time.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, another important reason for my feeling this way is that students can receive a lot of stress.</MI2> <SI2>Many people nowadays stressed out. If students have to understand concepts, they will receive too much stress which leads to health problems. <EX>This reminds of the time when I was sophomore in high school. I struggled from stress to study because I was not able to   understand my philosophy. I could not sleep for 2 weeks because I had to study philosophy. Philosophy is very hard to understand because these materials are too much and there are a variety of opinions about philosophy. So I am not totally dismissing the importance of understanding concepts and ideas but learning facts gives less stress.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
 <CO>All things considered that with the reasons mentioned above, I believe that I have sufficiently and adequately explained my position on the matters regarding this topic.</CO>

416&Parents should let children learn from their mistakes,::,"<IN>Some people say that parents should let their children from their mistakes. Personally, I strongly agree with this opnion for the following reasons. <TS>Exessive intervention of parents can make their children to have a depndent personality with a low self-esteem.</TS> <TR>In addition</TR>, children can develop problem solving abilities through their mistakes.</IN>

  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, parents who interfere in their children’s mistakes excessively make their children dependently.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Of course</TR>, parents are regarded as a important role model and they have a significiant influence on children’s psycological developement. <TR>However</TR>, children tends to develop their independence and self-esteem by fixing their own mistakes so parent’s excessvie intervntions for their mistakes can get rid of chances for their children to develop their self-respect. <EX>A recent research from the Ministry of Education in Korea shows how the behavior of parents is important. In the researh, children were given a paper to draw their own apperance in order to exam their self-esteem. Children with a high self-esteem were inclined to picture their apearance as a completed and lage one. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, the other children with a low self-esteem described themselves as a shobby and small. The researcher investigated the realtionship between them and their parents using a difficult task they attemped together. After the examaination, the investigator was suprised with the reasult that children who received more interventions for mistakes from their parents tended to show a decreased self-esteem.</EX> This means that parents’ exorbitant intervntions restrict the development of children’s self- respect. In this regard, parents should control the strong attention for their children to develop their appropriated inpendece and self-respect.</SI1></BO1>

  <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, children can improve their problem solving ability through mistakes they can make.</MI2> <SI2>Most people believe that the problem solving ability is the most significiant factor in success because most of the successful people agree that they could be in a road to success by developing the ability to fix and solve the problems in their childhood period. <EX>The researcher that I mentioned above claims that children with a high self-esteem tended to solve many difficult tasks more easily than the others with a low one. <TR>Also</TR>, they attained a varety of academic achievements with strong patience in their schools since they had a good problem soving ability. In this sense, children can make an essential ability to achieve their success from fixing thier mistakes.</EX></SI2></BO2>

  <CO><TR>In conslusion</TR>, parents have to give their children amount of chances to fix mistakes up.

"417& Students are influnced more by their students than by their teachers.

The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I agree with the given statement.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoints as follows.</IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, students are the groups who spend most of their times together. <TR>In other words</TR>, they are under same conditions in a same unit by studying, having lunch together or even having little gossip in lady’s room.</MI1> <SI1><EX>From my personal experience, I had a serious eating disorder, when I was in high school, mostly it was bulimia but sometimes anorexia also happened to me during that period. The symptom started to come to the surface when I got into second year in the school. I was very depressed most of my times and had no self-esteem at all, so that I was very unhappy with my whole life. This was because i thought I am fat even though I was a healthy weight. <TR>However</TR>, one day, one of my friends asked me about what is bothering you these days. <TR>So</TR>, I told her everything and I do not know how to overcome. She listened very carefully what I am saying and gave me a couple of advices; <TR>First</TR>, take positive attitudes toward everything in the world, <TR>second</TR>, acknowledge that you are the most important thing in this world, so be confident yourself. <TR>As a result</TR>, I got through those severe and crucial disorders with the help of my dearest friend. <TR>In this regard</TR>, friends are more influential to students than to teachers.</EX></SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>On the contrary</TR>, students simply affect each other.</MI2> <SI2>Differently put, they share everything that happens in their life, such as news of celebrities, new fashion trends or even talking about what they will do after graduation. This is because they have a lot of things that they can share together. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was in junior high school, my friends and I were in trouble which high school we have to apply for. Since the problem occurred to us, we talked and discussed about it every single day. <TR>In the end</TR>, we found that not only our friendship had been improved but also our goals to find suitable school for us had been on its actual way through having  thorough discussions each other. <TR>In this respect</TR>, students can benefits from each other because they are under almost same situation and have equal problems.</EX></SI2></BO2>

 <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of that students get more influenced by their friends than by their teachers. <TR>Once again</TR>, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe the two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represents the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim.</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, Saving money is important preparation for emergency in future.</MI1> <SI1>We don't know what comes to our life like car accident, health problems and so on. This is because all happening and accidents always generate to us very quietly and accidently. <TR>For that</TR>, we have to prepare about that situation, mostly related with money and monetary problems.<EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my uncle was the person who did not care about his bank work like saving money or invest some part for his future. <TR>Also</TR>, he was too active person to meet friends and hang out with people.

The research was related with people’s life after retirement as they were too old to work in their job field. There were two groups: one lived with joyful and having no problem to live without their income and they just kept their life with hobby and enjoyable activity like climbing, fishing and traveling, the other group was keeping to earn the money after retirement and most of them did gain lower money from part time job or labor work place for buying some food or maintaining their life. The big difference between two groups was discovered by research team. That was the amount of saving money in their young age when they can earn a enough money to save and spend.</EX> That research is shown to us, if we don’t save money in young age, we couldn’t have a relax life and free from concern about money until our old age. It proves that we should think about deposit in the bank and collecting extra money as long as we want to have a great life and comfortable life when we are too old to work.</SI2></BO2>

420&A teacher’s ability to relate well with students is more important than the ability to give knowledge.,::,"<IN>Many teachers increasingly try to be familiar and put too much emphasis on better relationship with their students. They think that those endeavors make it possible for students to enjoy their school lives more and more. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I do not agree with their minds and they have to concentrate on teaching students.</TS> There are several reasons for why I approve of my perception and I want to delve into some of the most significant ones here.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a main role of the teacher is to deliver lots of knowledge and enable students to get good grades on the tests.</MI1> <SI1>Most of the students strive for better scores on Scholastic Aptitude Test to enter the famous universities. Competition among students is so hard that it is very difficult to achieve their dreams. They have to accumulate knowledge as many as possible they can and get better results on SAT. <TR>Therefore</TR>, teachers should help students to learn more effectively. <EX>According to a recent study released by the Korean National Research Center, students who attended good universities have higher satisfaction level of teachers as to teaching skills than those who did not. In this regard, teacher’s ability to give knowledge can decide which universities students attend.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, by giving much knowledge, teachers can makes easier for students to learn about their major in universities.</MI2> <SI2>Although education in a university lays an expansion of high school, students have difficulties understanding the lectures in university due to their deficient knowledge. They need to deepen their understanding and base of the subjects they will learn in the future. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when I was high school student, my physics teacher was very knowledgeable and good at teaching profound concepts more easily such as relativity theory. It was really helpful after graduation because I did not have trouble with keeping up with the lecture, modern physics, in a university. <TR>As a result</TR>, this example represents how essential the teacher’s teaching is about the study in university.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To sup up</TR>, it is evident that students put a premium on the teacher’s ability to give knowledge. Teachers play a fairly important role in for students getting better grades on tests and studying in a university.

426&All high school students should take a course in a basic economics,::,"<IN>Some people say that all high school students have to learn about a basic economics.  <TS>Personally, I strongly agree that the basic economics course should be mandantory to study in high schools for the following reasons.</TS>  <TR>First</TR>, the course of economics enables students to be concerned about other field of study because economics  is a kind of applied studies. <TR>Besides</TR>, this course is so practical that students can apply this economical knowledge to their lives.</IN>

  <BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, economic courses are helpful for students to broaden their a variety of knowledge.</MI1> <SI1>Students should have konwledge from diverse subjects in order to take economics because this course is integrated with the other field of study such as a mathematics, sociology, psychology and history. This is the reason why people regard economics as a applied study.  <TR>Also</TR>, students can have a chance to apply their knowledge from the other subjects to economics. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I studied a basic economics in my high school, I realized that it needed to have a mathematical thinking ability and a understanding  socioeconomical  situation in sociological point of view. I had to memorize lots of mathematical formulas related with economy and apply the formulas to our social circumstances. If  I had no  backgound knowledge from mathematics and sociology, I would have a hard time finishing the course. <TR>As a result</TR>,  I had an opportunity to make use of my knowledge from other subjects through the basic economic coures. In this regard, the study of a basic economics allows students to have a chance to apply and develop  their background knowledge.</EX></SI1></BO1>

  <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, by developing their concept for economy and management skills of money through taking the basic economics,  students can easily adapt the world where they have to contact after graduation.</MI2>  <SI2>Most students tend to  realize the importance of economy and management of their money  after using their own money uneconomically. <TR>However</TR>, it is hard to find the proper finencial education after graduation. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a recent research from the Ministry of Finance and Economy shows that  a substantial number of young people are suffered from debts.

being able to speak well is more important than being able to write well",::,"<IN>There is a famous saying &quotSpeaking is the most effective way of communication.&quot I heard this quote from my parents throughout my life. They want me to speak well because they think speaking is more effective than writing in many ways. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, I agree with the statement that being able to speak well is more important than being able to write well for following reasons: frequency and effectiveness.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, speaking is frequently used in our life.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, in Korean society, the universities require the interview when they accept new students. It is an important process because many of good students fail to be accepted after they have the interview. Many Korean students are good at taking paper based test, and they get good scores in their test. <TR>However</TR>, many of them do not have good speaking skills because they do not express or speak during the class. <TR>However</TR>, the universities require the ability to speak well because in the real society, it is necessary. After they graduate from universities, students apply for jobs they want to have. <TR>However,</TR> many of jobs are required to speak well since companies always face with their customers. <TR>Thus</TR>, Speaking well is frequently used in our life, and it is always important.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, speaking in words is effective than other ways of communication.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To be specific</TR>, all president candidates prefer to speak in front of the citizens because they know it is effective. When they speak, they change their tone frequently. They stress in some sentences that they want to emphasize. <TR>Also</TR>, they change their voices during speaking to make the people laugh or entertain. If a candidate speak in a single tone, no citizens would listen or support the candidate because they are bored or cannot easily understand what the candidate want to tell them.<TR>Also</TR>, sometimes the candidates face difficulties during the debate. When the candidates have debate with each other on TV program, they cannot prepare or predict all questions that other candidates will ask the candidate. <TR>Thus</TR>, being able to speak well is necessary because it would make their ideas to be transferred effectively.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, frequency and effectiveness are the reasons why I agree with the statement that being able to speak well is more important than being able to write well.

428&Should there be a vacation or not?,::,"<IN>A lot of people think that students need to get long vacation once in a year. They believe that this vacation is really useful in many aspects. <TR>But</TR>, Other people argue that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. <TS><TR>However</TR>, in my opinion, they should be given one long vacation each year.</TS> This is because this is much more useful to seek their jobs and there is higher chance of relieving stress.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, long vacation is a much more effective approach to find their suitable job.</MI1> <SI1>We cannot ignore the fact that detecting and developing their talents requires a lot of efforts and time. It demonstrates my opinion that many students give much thought to decide the type of their works. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a junior in college, I was very worried about choosing my job. Luckily though, I experienced the occupation interpreting various documents at one of the famous large companies in Korea with the help of the long summer vacation. By working at the company for three months, summer vacation, I could recognize that I was interested in that kind of work. By now I have worked at interpreting company. If this vacation had not been offered to me, I would have never worked at the company where I am definitely satisfied .</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, a long period of vacation is better way to relieve students' stress.</MI2> <SI2>As they are normally under a lot of school works, they feel incredible amounts of stress from the school. <TR>So</TR>, they absolutely need some method of being away from the world such as traveling, exploring various interesting fields and meeting friends. I firmly consider traveling as the most effective way to alleviate their stress. <TR>Then</TR>, if they want to go on a trip, they will need pretty long time that they can spend to do what they want.</SI2></BO2> 

<CO><EX>According to the research conducted by the Ministry of School Management in Korea, seventy-five percent of students believe that going on vacation is the best way to get problems off their chests.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people nowadays have a habit of browsing many news of the personal lives of celebrities when we log on the internet.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, we usually tend to just search for many news related to the celebrities for gossip with friends, and what is surprising is that we are doing this behavior unintentionally and on no purpose. <EX>According to a study conducted by a well-known professor in Seoul National University, about 89% of the surveyed showed that they first clicked the news about celebrities, especially entertainers and sport stars when they logged on the internet. <TR>Also</TR>, he found that they had no specific reasons to click these sites, <TR>that is</TR>, they just clicked as they were there.

they spent too much time, specifically 34 minutes out of 1 hour, just to search for these news, which was not helpful and useless considering their original purpose of logging on the internet. So he referred to this phenomenon as an 'obsessed society for gossip.' </EX><TR>Therefore</TR>, we can say that we are too much obsessed with many useless news in our cyber-life.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, it is clear that we spend too much time paying attention to the personal lives of celebrities when we analyze the talk-issues in our real life.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it another way</TR>, as our talking materials are filled with so many things about the celebrities' life, we seems to be trapped to not our own life, but other famous people's one.<EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my sister is a big fan of SS501, which is a famous singer group consisted of 5 members in South Korea. Not only my sister, but also her friends like them very much, so I can say that their small-talks are bombarded with this group.

If this group did not exist in this world, my sister and her friends would not have any materials to talk with. My sister is not the only case. Many study results analyzing teenager's characteristics clearly show that many young students these days focus on the lives of celebrities in their real life too much, causing some negative effects, like neglecting study and exercise.</EX></SI2></BO2>

433&Movies and TV programs have negative effects on children.,::," <IN>In our current society, it is debatable whether movies and television programs have adverse effects on children. <TS>I agree this argument that movies and TV programs not only deteriorate children's emotional and physical development, but also can lead to risky behaviors.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, a myriad of movies and TV programs have adverse effect on children's body and mental.</MI1> <SI1>This is because they show a wide array of violent and sexual images. <EX>Take the study for the example. According to study of the Ministry of Education of United Kingdom, five hundred of kids who are under 7 years old were tested to reveal correlation between watching violent materials(movies and TV programs) and kids' emotional development. They watch the violent scenes for 2 hours everyday in a week. After watching programs, their mental state are measured by a variety of psychological and brainwave tests. <TR>As a result</TR>, the researchers found that prolonged exposure to harmful videos can ruin children’s mental.</EX> <TR>Thus</TR>, it is vital to avoid watching hazardous movies and TVs for younger people.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of</TR>, that movies and TVs are possible to cause children to dangerous actions.</MI2> <SI2>This is because children often tell the difference between reality and fantasy. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a few days ago, I read article about a child who died while imitating a action hero on movie.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, children have no time to talk to their parents.</MI1> <SI1>They are extremely busy with school, academy, and extra acts, and they are also busy in their free time doing studying and homework. This trend makes parents unable to talk to them, so parents cannot understand or learn about children's daily lives. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my friend is always busy because of his studying. He usually stays in his room for 6 hours doing his academy homework and additional studies.

There are two major reasons: to become financially success and to have a good relationship with others.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, as society is getting more complex, the human relationships are getting complicated.</MI1> <SI1>As you may know in the stories of books and movies in the past, people were divided into only two groups: good ones and bad ones. <TR>However</TR>, as time goes by, friends can become enemies and enemies can become coworkers. This has resulted in the intricate human relationships. <TR>Thus</TR>, you need to know different kinds of people in various fields. Through travel, you can meet diverse people and learn about a plethora of experiences from them. <TR>Besides</TR>, people in the past were responsible only for their family and themselves, but now they are members of communities, managers who have many subordinates.

It was to just make money and save it in your bank account but now, it is to think, act, and behave different in order to conquer the blue ocean. <TR>In this sense</TR>, travelling to foreign country may help you to have exceptional ideas in predicting tomorrow’s economy, unique ways of thinking in running an Internet business, and special eyes to see what others cannot see.

 ",::,"<IN>One of the best ways that parents help their teenage children to prepare for an adult life is to encourage them to take a part time job.
 
It sometimes becomes an interesting issue among parents whether it is good for children to take a part time job in order to learn adult life or not. Some people disagree with the point in that children have to study more. <TS>In my opinion, <TR>however</TR>, I agree with the opinion for two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, children can realize the meaning of money. <TR>Second</TR>, children can meet a lot of people.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, children can learn about money through a part time job.</MI1> <SI1>With the development of society, money plays pivotal role on people' lives. People cannot live without money. In other words, one needs a large amount of money to sustain their lives and raise children. <TR>However,</TR> some would succeed their life with money; others would experience harmful results from money. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is important to learn about how to manage money wisely before adult. Children who take a part time job can earn money which is equivalent to their working hours. It leads children to realize preciousness of money. <TR>Also</TR>, saving money enables them to buy stuff which they would like to buy. It takes much time for adult who have ever experienced a part time job to know value of money. <TR>Therefore</TR>, a part time job has good percussions on children' value system about money.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Another reason</TR>, that should be taken into consideration is that children can learn communication skills when they have a part time job.</MI2> <SI2>It does not take a genius to know that students' duty is studying hard and gaining knowledge. Most students spend their most of time studying.<TR>However</TR>, it causes them not to know methods to solve problems from difficult personal relationship. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when they enter university, they meet a lot of people who have diverse opinion. <TR>However</TR>, they have ever experiences problems related to relationship, and have a hard time to treat others who have different opinion. <TR>Therefore</TR>, parents help children to meet a lot of people and having a part time job is a good method in order to improve their communication skills.</EX> When it comes to part time job, workers would meet diverse customers. Hearing from and looking at them, workers can learn how to respect other people and their opinion. If children become workers, they can communicate with others, maintain their relationship, and enhance their interpersonal skills. All children experienced through a part time job enables children to prepare adult life..</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, I totally would like to say that a part time job is influential for children to prepare their adult life. The reason why I think like this is because not only can children learn about value of money, but also children can improve their communication skills.</CO>",::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,Good essay with a clear argument.

439&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Living with foreginers in childhood is very beneficial for child's cognitive development. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::," <IN>Nowadays, we meet foreigners more often on the streets and we have many more chances to communicate with foreigners than we do in the past. This is because, with substantial development of technology, there is a less burden such as a financial problem to move around the world. <TR>Therefore</TR>, there are many people who want their child to be in foreign countries for education using the ease of going to other countries. <TS>I agree on the statement that living with foreigners in childhood is beneficial for child’s cognitive development.</TS></IN>
 
 <BO1><MI1><TR>Primarily</TR>, living with foreigners provides children with many different cultural experiences.</MI1> <SI1>I firmly believe that wide range of experiences is important in childhood. <TR>Because</TR>, according to research, various experiences in childhood give children chances to feel many different emotions and this will help children’s cognitive development. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my cousin was born in Canada and she spent her childhood there. She learned Canadian cultures in school and Korean cultures at home with her family. With wider range of experiences compared to her peers, she tended to learn and get something quicker than others which I believe it is because of more well-developed cognition.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>Additionally</TR>, children would hear and learn different languages if they live with foreigners from their childhood.</MI2> <SI2>Children have to learn languages on certain stage in their childhood. I believe that learning two or three different languages at the same time make them to think more than when they learn only one. Thinking deeply stimulates brain activity and it will help cognitive development of children. There is also a study that people who learned multiple languages in their childhood, shows higher IQ than other people who did not.</SI2></BO2> 
 
 <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly agree that children can better develop their brain’s cognitive part if they live with foreigners in childhood. It is because they get culturally different experiences and this will cause feeling various emotions which is helpful for cognitive development of child. <TR>Plus</TR>, learning different languages can also be a stimulus for their brain activities.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Very good essay with some grammar mistakes.

"440&In order to succeed, it is better to develop many different skills than to focus on one skill.",::,"<IN>Many people believe that they have to focus on one specialized skill rather than diverse skills in order to accomplish a good achievement in their fields. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I strongly disagree with this statement for the following two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, most of the job fields are strongly related with other fields. <TR>Second,/TR>, a variety of skills can enable them to develop their work more easily.</TS></IN>

  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, skills that are required  in the job world are more and more integrated with skills of other fields.</MI1> <SI1>Of course, people should spend amount of time and efforts learning their specialized skill to be a successful expert in their fields. <TR>However</TR>, knowledge in professional fields tends to accept diverse information from other advanced fields to develop itself. <EX>Let me take my job field for example, I have been devoted to studying physical therapy area for a long time. My field of study are constantly developing from dealing with a simple task to managing a variety of tasks. When I studed it ten years ago, I just studied for rehabilition that was focus on patients’ function and pain. <TR>However</TR>, I nowadays should study for their managenments to improve their active daily living. In order to deal with it well, I have to contact with other fileds of experts such as social workers, doctors, nurses, and those who work in the goverment. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I have to study other fields realated with patient’management to communicate them.</EX> <TR>In this reagred</TR>, it is necessary for most job area to interconnect with others to develop appropriately . <TR>Consquently</TR>,  people shold know knowledge and skills of other area.</SI1></BO1>

  <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>,  a variety of skills help people to handle their work more efficiently.</MI2>  <SI2>Nowadays, the world become more united than before. <TR>In this context</TR>, the abilities to get more useful information from the online and to have a good english proficiency  are more and more important in their work. <TR>Therefore</TR>, a substaintial number of people have invested to improve  their computer skill and english skill. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, I have to seach for amount of information on the Internet journal to treat my clinents well. <TR>In addition</TR>, most of the information are written by english so I have to study english continuously. <TR>In this sense</TR>, other skills such as computer and english are essential factor to improve people’s work.</EX></SI2></BO2>

441&people learn more by watching television than by reading books,::,"<IN>There is a famous saying “Don’t believe what TV says.” I heard this saying from my parents. They want to get information from other sources beside TV programs because they thought those programs are not trustful. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, I disagree with the statement that people learn more by watching television than by reading books for following reasons: greater details from books and reading at our pace.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, books provide greater details than what the television does.</MI1> <SI1>Since television needs to provide as much information as it can, the information is usually general and simple. <TR>However</TR>, books provide specific details and more facts than from the television. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, When I first a documentary on TV about the president Park, I thought he was a very good president because he contributed to improve the economy. <TR>However</TR>, after I read books about him, I realized that my thoughts about him were wrong. Even though he contributed to the development, he committed many crimes, such as dictated for several years and killed many people. <TR>Also</TR>, he bribed to many different areas to get power even though his behavior damaged the country’s reputation. If I never read books to get information, I would not find my fault forever. <TR>Thus</TR>, books give us more details and facts.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, we can read the books at our pace.</MI2> <SI2>TV programs are limited in time, so they provide information quickly. <TR>Sometimes</TR>, people cannot get proper information because they are too fast to understand. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, books can be read in anytime, and it can be read several times again if people need to understand properly. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, I watched a TV program about the Korean War because I needed to do my homework. <TR>However</TR>. I could not get information in detail because they were too fast. <TR>Also</TR>, I could not get information, such as date and duration of war since the program was only an hour long. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, I could get more and specific information from the books than from the TV program since I could read at my own pace. <TR>Also</TR>, when I could not understand the process of the war, I could go back and read several times again.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, we can get more benefits from books since we can read at our pace.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, greater details from books and reading at our pace are the reasons why I disagree with the statement that people learn more by watching television than by reading books. Even though we could spend less time getting information by watching television, it is more beneficial to read books. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I strongly suggest books since they can help you get more and specific information when you need to find them.</CO> ",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,"Essay is organized into clear sections.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second of all</TR>, working a part-time job encourages high school students to ponder their career and future seriously.</MI2> <SI2>Because deciding their career paths are sometimes more important than a good academic point, they should think about what they want to do and what they want to become after graduation through working a part-time job.

With this progress of human civilization, many issues have become controversial, one of which is that euthanasia.

Since this is a revelation of god and common sence of every people, it is a rigt way to oppose the euthanasia.

444& It is unrealistic for people to work at the same company for their entire lives.,::,"<IN>There is a controversy over whether it is unrealistic for people to work at the same company for their whole lives or not. Some people believe that working at the same company would be good since it is stable. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I do believe that working at the same company would not be good at all for both a worker and company since it makes company have less profits and worers hard to succeed.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, if people work for the same company for a whole life, they will be sinck and tired of their jobs and it will affect negatively on the company.</MI1> <SI1>This is becuase if they keep on doing the same work they would end up getting bored with the work, their coworkers who they meet everyday and the surroundings. This is related to the low productivity. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a research shows that the employees who have been working under 3 years make sales increases 20% more than the employees who have been working over 3 years. The older employees said that this is the due to the fact that they are bored with their jobs and it is no fun.</EX> This clearly shows that the longer workers work in one firm, the less they make profits for the firm.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, It is not good for the worker in the long run.</MI2> <SI2>Since workers who working at the same firm can not expeirence a variety of things to make them develop their talents for their success. If workers do the same job at the same firm, it is less likely for them to have other expeirences which can gain through toher companies. This will make them expand their horizon. <EX>According to an article, most of the CEOs prefer to hire people who have several work experiences. They stated that those who are working for only on company  for years give an impression that they do not have courage to challenge new environment and they do not like professional workers because of the lack of expeience. In short, they are not looked as promised workers for the company.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I firmly believe that just working at the same firm has not good effect on the worker and the firm since it causes the company  to have low productivity and it does not make workers become successful because of the lack of work experience in other firms. <TR>Therefore</TR>, workers should not be afraid of changing their careers and companies should encourage them to challenge other jobs for the success of the firm as well as the worker.</CO>

445&It is better for governments to spend money building new housing than preserving historic or traditional buildings.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not it is better for governments to spend money building new housing than preserving historic or traditional buildings.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, living near or at traditional buildings allow people to stay healthy.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that traditional buildings made by environmentally friendly materials such as woods, guarantees people to be healthy, by breathing fresh air due to its effect, whereas modern buildings can be harmful to health by the chemicals of building materials such as cement, and paints. <TR>Moreover</TR>, breathing harmful chemicals are one of the main factors of diseases through weakening the immune system.</SI1></BO1>

<SI2><TR>In addition</TR>, preserving historical buildings enables country’s reputation and economy. This is due to the fact that historical buildings which shows the culture of the country, can serve as one of the key motivators for foreigners to visit the country.

They started to make the interview as a group meeting, suggesting us to communicate each other just like when we have chatting with friends.

Most of the enterprises have made an effort to hire talanted workers competitively. <TR>However</TR>, hiring these workers is not easy because the number of them is too small to hire in all companies. <TR>Consequently</TR>, companies have changed their police from hiring to making skilled workers.

450&Children should learn how to manage their money when they are young to be financially responsible adults. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN><TS>We are living in the society called 'the age of capitalism.' It means that it is imperative for people to learn how to manage their money wisely. Some people argue that as children usually do not make money, it is not useful for them to learn how to use money</TS>. <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this argument and I firmly believe that the youth have to learn how to manage their money to be financially responsible adults.</IN>

<BO1> <MI1> <TR>First of all</TR>, people who learned how to manage their money in the young age can become responsible for their financial status as habits made in the young last for a long time.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, habits have powerful influence on each person how to behave in one's life. So if people learn how to use money wisely, that is, how to portion their own money between saving and spending, in the younger age, then they are more likely to become a sensible citizen who know how to manage their financial status. We can agree that the habits tend to make us to follow the specific way that they lead. <EX>According to a study conducted by a well-known professor in Seoul National University, those who learned from their parents when they were young how to use their allowance, such as saving some portion of pocket money and writing down where they spent money, helped them to escape from bankruptcy in their life. <TR>Especially</TR>, the number was surprising. The result showed that 78% of the surveyed who learned managing their money were on financially sound condition, in contrast, 32% of those who did not learn were on financially good condition</EX></SI1>.</BO1>

<BO2> <MI2> <TR>Second</TR>, we have to help children how to manage their money as they are immature to control their money.</MI2>  <SI2>To put it another way, it is reasonable for adults to teach and supervise the way children use their allowance, because they do not have enough knowledge and experience how to spend money. <TR>For these young people</TR>, we have a duty to protect them from falling into trouble due to financial problems. In particular, by exercising this duty, we can raise children as a sensible and responsible citizen in the future. <EX>For example, when I was an elementary school student, I got 10$ per week from my parents as an allowance. <TR>At first</TR>, my parents did not meddle into my money as they thought I could handle it properly. But it was wrong, as I spent all 10$ in a day to buy toys, although it was for one week. <TR>So</TR>, my parents changed their mind to keep a close eye on how I used my money</EX>.Due to their supervision and instruction, I gradually made a habit of spending my money in a planned manner. This habit helps me to become a responsible person. My example clearly shows the point that it is proper to teach children how to manage their money.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, I certainly have a reason to argue that we should instruct the youth how to manage their money. There is an saying that 'ex-ante' is always better than 'ex-post.' <TR>Thus</TR>, prepared children who learn financial responsibility will make our society to be a responsible one.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,"Excellent essay!

<BO1> <MI1>The first point is that online books are more convenient than printed books to using.</MI1> <SI1>Most of the people are using at least one electric instrument, such as smart phone or i-pad. Through these instruments, people can easily read the online books instead of heavy printed books.
<EX>Take my experience as an example. When I was in middle school, there was no online books. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I had to go to school with a heavy bag filled with lots of text books. <TR>However, in these days</TR>, there are lots of things that could make me available read books without papers.

<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason is that online books are cheaper than printed ones.</MI2> <SI2>Online books do not need paper or ink. Only electric instrument is needed for online books. <TR>Therefore</TR>, people can get online books with cheaper price. <TR>In other words</TR>, people who are in tight budget can save their outcome in buying books.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, <TR> first and foremost</TR>, business should contemplate how to make products before selling to their customers.</MI1> <SI1>Considering about making products will affect their future negatively or positively and it is up to companies. <TR>In the event that</TR>, corporations fabricate malfunctioned products, customers will disappoint their commodities and companies will not procure money.<EX> <TR>For instance</TR>, my brother bought IPod but unfortunately, it was totally broken.

  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that happiness is ineffective or impractical.

It is often said that young generation today are less helping others than those in the past because modern society runs on individualism. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I believe that the young people today tend to help others more than young generation in the past for two reasons: to give good impression at university they apply and they have more access to information about volunteer works.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the point that volunteer work record has good influence when students apply for university encourages them to help others more.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that as modern society is becoming increasingly competitive at getting into good college, many students try to attract universities attention by filling their application with various activities they did for their community.

<EX>According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2009, there was a huge difference between volunteer rates in past 30 years. Students, who went to school before university announced to count their extracurricular activities as part of screening students, had a volunteer rate of 30 percent.

Authorities should protect our community’s safety from illegal activities and keep public developments by repressing some people’s freedom.</TS></IN>

    <BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, people’s freedom can be inhibited by laws and regulations to protect the community’s safty.</MI1> <SI1>Ofcouse people’s freedom is one of the basic needs to be respected by others. <TR>However</TR>, those who commit crimes and get in trouble with the law should be purnished and inhibited their freedom. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, nowadays, people search a variety of information from the Internet.

I will explain it in detail.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, when it comes to making better performance in academic areas, children should concentrate not on their money but on their studying.</MI1> <SI1>The best time in a school are given to the young children to learn and develop their knowledge that would guarantee their future including a lot of money. <EX>From my experience for an example, a friend of mine had struggle to work and study at the same time due to his financial problem. At that time he seemed to have quite good sense about money since hi supported his family as well as his school. <TR>But</TR>, the problem was raised when he graduated his university. The main reason why no companies want to hire him is due to his poor grade. <TR>Therefore</TR>, in order to obtain good grade and skill, he decided to university again, resulting in waste of time and money conversely.</EX> This implies that young children must focus their main goal such as enhancing studying abilities or maintaining relationship with others, not about money. If young students miss their proper period to study, the result of this would be so bitter.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, in order to intensify strong relationship with friends, the children would spend their money with others without any consideration about money.</MI2> <SI2>This is because the power of money is too sensitive to influence harmful effects on the friendship. <TR>Thus</TR>, if children think only how to manage their money, the use of money may be abused. <EX>When I was in a high school, one of my friends was too obsessed about his money.

459&The way to dress is a good indicator of his or her personality and character.,::,"<IN>There is an old saying, 'People are what they wear.' It means that we can judge someone based on what he ore she wears, as it reflects personality and character. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this opinion and firmly believe that the personality and character of people are beyond how we dress. And my view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, how we dress is more dependent on money and environment than the personality and character.</MI1> <SI1>In other words, we cannot judge someone by looking into what we wear as the way we dress is more influenced by other factors, such as money and situation. Thus, it is wrong if we guess the personality just based on clothes. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I am a very bright and outgoing person. If we agree with the argument that the clothes show the character of person, it would be right that I have to wear bright-colored and sporty clothes. <TR>However</TR>, as I am a member of school of which policy about wearing code is very strict, I am usually in a formal attire, dark-colored uniform and leather shoes. This dress style does not match with my character. <TR>In addition</TR>, I am short of money these days so I cannot afford fancy sporty wearings, which are very expensive. But I am always active in my daily life even though I do not wear such clothes.</EX> This illustrates the point that 'judging the book by its cover.' does not apply to the people.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, the dress code cannot show the true personality, as the clothes are usually transient whereas characters are relatively permanent.</MI2><SI2><TR>Of course</TR>, if someone wears a bright T-shirt, we can guess that he(or she) will be somewhat outgoing and bright. <TR>However</TR>, it does not fit to all the situations. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, we sometimes change our dress code to counter our personality. To put in another way, what we show by wearing specific clothes can be actually totally different from our real character. I have one example when I was a college student. My friend was usually shy and gloomy, so I recommended him to wear a bright-colored T-shirt to overcome his gloomy character. <TR>However</TR>, It would be wrong to think that my friend had the character of happiness as he wore such T-shirt.</EX> <EX>According to a study by a well-known professor in Seoul National university, 78% of the students surveyed answered that they chose specific clothes, which did not show their real character, in order to change their mood, averagely once a week. The results shows that it is impetuous for us to guess someone's character just by looking into what he or she wears.<EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To conclude</TR>, I insist that if we want to judge someone's inner personality, we had better focus on what we are doing and saying instead of seeing what we wear. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I can say that 'People are what they wear.' is a wrong expression and we should be careful when we want to see the 'truth' of people.</CO>

It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.",::,"<IN>There is a famous saying &quotFocus on what you are good at&quot I heard this quote from my parents since they wanted me to specialize in what I am good at, so that I can get a job that I am specialized in. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, I believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject for following reasons: high possibility of getting a job and high salary.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people who are specialized in one specific subject would have higher possibility of getting a job.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, my uncle had broad knowledge of many academic subjects when he was a student. He took lots of classes that are related to engineering, which is his major. <TR>After several years</TR>, he applied to a car company, but he was rejected because he could not answer some questions that are related to his major. <TR>However</TR>, my sister was specialized in art. She focused only on art, and she wanted to be an art director. After she graduate, she became an art director easily because she knew almost all knowledge related to her major, and others envies her a lot.</EX></SI1></BO1> 

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, people who are specialized in a specific subject would likely to have high salary.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my brother was a student who had broad knowledge of several subjects. When he went to the university, he chose his major as economy, but he took lots of classes that he likes regardless of his major. After he gets a job related to his major, he thought that many customers would like him, but customers did not like him because other workers were more specialized in the area than him, and he was less paid than he expected. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, my friend, Paul, majored in business. He took lots of classes that are related to his major. When he graduated, he took almost all classes that are related to business. <TR>After that</TR>, he established a company. In several months, his company succeeds and benefited with his plans and strategies that he learned from classes that he took when he was in the university.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, it is absolutely true that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. Even though having broad knowledge of several subjects would help people in many areas, it is more beneficial to specialize in one subject.

"462&Colleges and universities must do a better job preparing students for workplace

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, through learning diverse courses such as business management, liberal arts and sociology, students are able to have opportunities to become well-balanced person and study their majors deeply.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In addition</TR>, diverse activities such as field trips, school club, tutoring and seminar also provide them with a broad human relationship and perspective of view. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when i specialized in fine arts at college, tutoring program with professors and school club activity as an amateur musical designer empower me to learn my major deeply and improve my art works.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, there are other private academies except college to teach students job skills such as computer skills, and marketing.</MI2> <SI2><TR>As a result</TR>, it is not necessary that a college should offer programs to prepare students for workplace. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, before graduation, i took several computer courses such as photoshop, illustrator and SPASS at private academy and it is enough for me to handle computer programs which are usually used at work.</EX> It is waste of money if university students take these courses with expensive tuition fee.</SI2></BO2>

This is because there are the various criminals which keep increasing by the guns all in the world. <TS>While some people think that people should not buy the guns, I believe that the guns are able to be purchased.</TS> Here are some reasons which would support my thesis: the reasons why people buy the guns are for protection by themselves, and to make reduce the criminals</IN>

            <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, also a very common is that people need to have the rights buy the guns to protect by themselves.</MI1> <SI1>This is most important issue in modern society.  As time goes, people commit the violent criminals more and more with shooting the guns. There are no safety places in the world. Nowadays, people could be faced the criminals in anywhere with no reasons by murders.<TR>Therefore</TR>, people have to protect themselves every time. <TR>Of course</TR>, keeping the guns with people is not only way to protect themselves. <TR>However</TR>, <TR>especially</TR>, the seniors do not have any choices but to protect by themselves with holding the guns with them, because they are week to protect by themselves.

            <BO2><MI2><TR>The second point is that</TR>, in my point of view, given the rights to buy the guns is the way to reduce a criminal.</MI2> <SI2>If having the guns becomes a common situation, no one can shoot the guns without reasons as murders easily. There are no more strong and violent actions than shooting the guns in the world. <TR>Therefore</TR>, if people recognize that most of people have the guns, even murders cannot commit the criminals easily. Even if the guns are dangerous, in my opinion it could be the best way to reduce the criminal actions.</SI2></BO2>

465&The decisions that people make quickly are always wrong.,::,"<IN>Some people say that  quick decisions are always wrong.<TS> <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with the above statement for  the following two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, modern societies require people to make their descisions in a restricted amount of time. <TR>In addition</TR>,  an advanced education  in schools can allow students to improve their decision making and problem solving  skills.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, nowadays, people should  make proper decisions right away to adapt to social environments they face to.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Of course</TR>, decisions made slowly may be more correct in that they have more time to think of. <TR>However</TR>, those living in a modern society  are required a substantial number of decision making in a short period of time. In the past, our ancestors did not have a variety of situations to decide quickly in their routine work such as agriculture. That’s because their work was so simple and repetitive  that they could predict and adapt more easily to their pattern of work. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, those living in the present have a myriad of tasks and  difficulties to adjust their life to their environments. <TR>In this regard</TR>,  modern people can not spend enough time making their own decision to one task  since their circumstances are changing constantly.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, students’ decision making and problem solving abilities can be developed by proper education in their school.</MI2> <SI2>It is true that the most important  goal of education in school is to deliver knowlege to students. <TR>However</TR>, the focus of modern education is to improve the thinking abilities of students rather than to deliver information to them, which leads them to make their decision more quickly and solve their problems effectivly. Let me take my experience  for example, I had a hard time keeping up with american students. I think that they were  familiar with solving mind using taskes more easily than me and their decision was correct and made in a short amount of time. I had a hard time because i was more used to Korean education, which is not flexible as American education and pays more attention to deliver knowlege rather than to increase students’ thinking ability. <TR>In this sense</TR>, students can make better decisions as quickly as they can  through advanced educations that help students to improve on their thinking abilities.</SI2></BO2>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, another benefit of working with a small company is that one may work more closely with his or her co-workers.</MI2> <SI2>There are so many employees and teams in a large company.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, television promotes family to talk by causing them to be clustered.</MI1> <SI1>This results in lack of communication.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, modern appartment bulidings would guarantee safety of inhabitors.</MI1> <SI1>They have a systematic security program and always check indentification of people from outside.

It is because many people today are very busy so they have to many things such as excercising, working, and studying. <TR>In this situation</TR>, doing several tasks will lead to confuse to people.

<TS><TR>However</TR>, I firmly believe that young generations today have huge influence to decisions for future society for two reasons : they have more chance to show their thoughts and can choose their future leader.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the improvement of technology has played a significant role in sharing one’s opinion.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that with the invention of smart phones, internet, and worldwide SNS such as facebook and twitter young people who are using these mostly share their thoughts about government’s policy at anytime and anywhere around the world instantaneously. <TR>Thus</TR>, they can lead the issues they talk about into social issues which can affect government’s attitude.
<TR>For example</TR>, when I was in grade eleven, there was a happening about student’s suicide due to violence from school bullies. Many young people were furious and began to talk about it on their facebook, twitter online forums and had petition school and government to deal with this issue which lead to huge social crisis at our country. <TR>Therefore</TR>, to never make this problem arise once again, the school punished, kicked out the bullies and the government decided to make a policy to write at student record about student’s violence at school which can affect student’s future at society.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, young people these days have a right to vote for their future president, senator, and mayor who can change the society.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that since one-third of country consists of young generations their voting rate can affect elections. <TR>Moreover</TR>, people who are elected use their power to make a change in society on behalf of their voters. <TR>Therefore</TR>, when young people vote for the good person, they can have bright future of their country’s society.

With less work, students will be less tired to do and thus, will concentrate easily on their project, while when students do it alone, they will be exhausted and have less concentration on it. <TR>Moreover</TR>, having a high concentration is one of the main factors of making students to learn more efficiently.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>According to the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2009, there was a huge difference between two groups of students in their academic performance.</MI2><SI2>Students in Group A were assigned to do projects with their partners and those in Group B received projects to do on their own. The researchers showed that the former group was able to remember the facts about the topic about the projects they have worked on by 60 percent than the latter group. <TR>In particular</TR>, the students in Group A showed much higher concentration rate than those in Group B. This implies that working with partners on a projects has a direct correlation with the amount of concentration and improvement into academic performance.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>In addition</TR>, having partners to work at a project allows students to learn to solve problems more wisely.</MI3> <SI3>There is a saying that two heads are better than one. This indicates that better solutions to a problem can arise from more people than a single person. <TR>Therefore</TR>, students can learn to deal with problems by discussing with each other.
<TR>For example</TR>, when I was in grade eight, my teacher assigned a group science project that counted 50 percent of our second semester grade. During the project, our experiment went badly wrong which can lead to failure of our project. <TR>However</TR>, when we talked and discussed with each other for a solution to the problem, we were able to solve it without getting into more trouble. Had I not discussed with my group members, we never would have cleared the issue which would have caused us to have low grade on second semester.</SI3></BO3>

",::,"<IN><TR>Recently</TR>, I read the news article. It is reported that many disease of adult people is caused by lots of stress. <TS>I think it is true. It is very important to reducing the stress, because the stress is the source of all diseases.</TS> When my stress builds up, I always watch movies or climb the mountains. These activities reduce my stress.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, watching movies gets rid of my stress and reduce the difficulties of my life.</MI1> <SI1>When I watch a movie, I usually can forget the stress and problems of the life. During the running time of the movie, I never think the stress and troubles. Especial comedy and action movies are good for me to reduce the stress. When I failed the math mid term, 2 years ago, I watched the movie 'There's something about Marry'. I could not help laughing for 2 hours.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, I climb the mountains when I get stress.</MI2> <SI2>While I climb the mountain, I can have many things: the fresh air, the broad mind and the time of thinking carefully. I usually climb the Buck-han mountain which is located in the north of Seoul, on Sunday. This mountain is the only place that I can breath the fresh air, because I live the large city, Seoul. Climbing the mountain reduces the stress that I got during the week. I usually go up the mountain alone, so I have plenty of time to think the problems. The thought that I thought while climbing becomes the solution of the problem that bothered me for few days.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>As I mentioned above</TR>, I watch the movie and climbing the mountain to escape the stress and difficulties of modern life.

476&Spending time with family is better than spend time at work.,::,"<IN>Some may argue that spending time at work is better than spend time with family members. <TS>Regarding this issue, I side with the statement for the following reasons. For one thing, people are able to spend time with their families. <TR>Additionally</TR>, they can obtain their overall true happiness in life.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, you can form strong bonds with family by spending time with your family than at work.</MI1> <SI1>Today, people immerse themselves in work, and thus they don’t pay much attention to those around them. The problem is that they tend to not only distance themselves from their friends and coworkers, but also from their family members. To avoid becoming excluded from family, it is important to people should be encouraged to spend time with family as many as possible. Take my personal experience as an example. When I first started working, I was determined to quickly get promoted at work. <TR>Naturally</TR>, I found it really hard to relax at home and to have fun with my family. As time passed, I was unaware of the interest and problems of the other members of my family. Even worse, I lost track of the special occasions celebrated by my family, such as birthdays and graduations.</SI1></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, people can achieve happiness by spending time with their family.</MI2> <SI2>Today’s society is highly competitive, and as a result, people are pressured to excel at work, and thus they rarely enjoy their free time. At such times, spending more time with family can be of great help because it allows people to leave their daily concerns behind. To illustrate this point further, let me use as an example the case of my cousin who used to be a workaholic. He invariably spent more time at work than at home. <TR>Consequently</TR>, he increasingly stressed out by overwhelming amounts of work. His moods only changed when he started spending more time playing games with his siblings and going on picnics with his family. By spending time with his family, he instantly found himself relaxed and happy again. For a short moment at home, my cousin seems to forget about problems he has had at work and gains enough breathing space to look forward to working next day.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people do not have the right to severely use and destroy the lands.</MI1> <SI1>It is because lands are originally owned not only by humans but also by other animals. For animals, <TR>furthermore</TR>, lands are more important factors to live than human, because they normally find out and eat rare foods in the lands. <TR>However</TR>, nowadays, since humans destroy lands, animals are hard to find foods, and some animals are endangered. According to a research conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in South Korea, for the last twenty years, about two hundreds species of animals are endangered because of human activities such as building factories near the river and contaminating it. Even though humans and animals have the identical right to use lands, nowadays human seems to extort this right from the animals. <TR>Thus</TR>, people should protect lands for other animals and prevent from endangering them.</SI1></BO1>
  
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, endangered animals can negatively impact on our future generation.</MI2> <SI2>It is due to the fact that the eco system on earth is organically consisted, so if some animals are endangered then it might have eventually negative impacts on other livings and human in the near future. The case of Papua which is very small island near Australia can support this statement well. People who lived in Papua only focused on their economic development, so they extract natural resources and contaminated their rivers. The number of fishes and animals are significantly decreasing, but people do not care about it. <TR>However</TR>, after twenty years later, it can severely negative influence on human since people cannot eat fishes and they are lack of nutrition such as protein. <TR>Thus</TR>, people should protect lands for our future generation.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a sense of achievement allow people to satisfy their lives.</MI1> <SI1>These days, a lot of people work for fortune not their vision. <TR>However</TR>, jobs with high salary require people to pour all of their time and energy to work places and tasks. <TR>Therefore</TR>, if people would not find their value from their jobs, even if they feel financial profounds, they are nnot happy in daily lives. <EX>Let me take my uncle's story as an example. He always hoped to become writer for children's book. <TR>However</TR>, he started his career as an account, <TR>because</TR>, it was more stable and easier to make a lot of money than being writer. <TR>However</TR>, every night he came back his home, he looked too much stressful and tired. <TR>As a result</TR>, a couple of years later, we decided to quick the job and then turn his career as a writer, and he won public recognition through his writing.

So he stopped to work in a company that had different value and goals about goods. He started his own company in garage. During the first three year, he could not make any money.

Through interview, he said that other people might think that he wanted to give up to develop and run my business, but he always felt happy and satisfied whenever he follow this jeer. </SI2>From his experience, it can be validate that the most important factor for happy life is their own goal not money.</BO2>",::,2,::,4,::,2,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,This essay is not in a standard essay format with a conclusion paragraph.

482&Television has more effect on people than on books (or telephone),::,"<IN><TS>There have been several heated debates whether TV has more impact on individuals than the books.

Still I believe that TV has tremendous effect on viewers, not only because the contents are easy to figure out but people are more likely to get expose to such media device. So from my perspective I agree with the given statement.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>The first reason for my opinion that can be seen by everyone is that TV contents enable us to grasp matter faster.</MI1> <SI1>Some people may argue, reading book is pleasing and deliver in-depth information. Though such points have merit points, understanding the core meaning of the book is not as simple as what is on the small screen. It has bunch of motion pictures and sound. <TR>So</TR>, just like old saying one picture worth thousand words, this can facilitate viewers understand what the story is all about. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, in 2009 when there was major earth quake in Haiti many volunteers went there to support the people in need of help. This was all possible because viewers could see how severe the damage and casualty was at Haiti. Through real time broadcast, people saw bleeding children and corrupted buildings that volunteers all over the world went to support. This example illustrates how TV can easily make people understand the contents.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
 
<BO2><MI2>Another crucial reason for my argument is that TVs are everywhere that people are always exposed to it. In this modern society, finding those machines is not such a difficult thing to do.</MI2> <SI2>We can find it in the clinic, school, restaurant and sometime even in the bathroom. So whether it is intentional or not, we are likely to pick up a lot of information through TV. <TR>In addition to that</TR>, countless number of workers leaves TV on while they even work. <EX><TR>According to the survey done at Oxford University </TR>about one third of the corporate leave the machine on. Most of staff are not actually paying attention to what was on. <TR>However</TR>, many of them remember a bit of what was paying at the time.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, as people are interacting with TV people are likely to be effected by TV.</SI2></BO2>

Life becomes very complex today and they have to survive for success every day. Students have to study hard to achieve high score and employees have to work hard for personal achievement and wealth.

I have met teachers more than 15 for elementary, middle and high school students. So I think a teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the ability to give knowledge.

502&It is better to spend money for vacation and travel than to save it for the future.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether it is better to spend money for vacation and travel than to save it for the future. The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on the individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement. <TR>First</TR>, by taking a trip, people can relieve their stress more efficiently. <TR>Second</TR>, one can broden his or her perspectives through traveling.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, traveling is a good way to relieve people's stress more effectively.</MI1> <SI1>People usually get stress out from a heavy load of their work and spend most of their time working indoors. <TR>Therefore</TR>, they need time to refress themselve, recharge energy and relieve their stress.

503&Countries should spend more money on the exploration of outer space than on the preservation of the environment.,::,"<IN>Recently, many environmental problems such as global warming and pollution has been being issued.

There are also broad researches going on about the outer space. <TS><TR>In my opinion</TR>, countries should spend more money on the preservation of the environment rather than spending money on the exploration of outer space.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, we should consider the present days more importantly than the future. The matters of the environment are what we should be worrying about now.</MI1> <SI1>If the environment is polluted and damaged, there is no future. Us humans are a part of the environment, and we live within the environment. If the environment gets destroyed, we cannot live a well-being life, nor we can be sure of our survivals. If there is no future, there would be no point of researching about the outer space, since we don't yet have much developed technology to find out about aliens or alternative planet Earth, because we are not even sure of our survival.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, it is our responsibility to preserve the environment to leave the environment to our future generations.</MI2> <SI2>The research cannot be continued if the environment is damaged.

While some people like to use their hands, others want to use machines. <TS><TR>As for me</TR>, I prefer to let machines do my work rather than by hands because using machines allow people to save lots of time and minimize their efforts.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, using machines is a great way to do job with less effort.</MI1> <SI1>Today, most people live bust lives. Using machines make them save time and their lives less stressful. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my mother used to tell me that it took lot of time to cut up vegetables by hand. However, using a food processor, she can easily do the amount of work in a short time.</EX> <TR>Indeed</TR>, machines have made people to save a lot of time and live more efficiently.</SI1></BO1>

He now finishes tilling with ease and spends the rest of his Sunday with his family and friends.</EX> Physical labor is very tiring, but machines can make difficult jobs with less demanding.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, many people can successfully do lots of great work by hand. <TR>However</TR>, I would still rather use machines that can help people save time and effort.

505&A job with more vacation time is better than a job with higher salary with less time off,::,"<IN>As social situations are more competitive and complexed than before, many people want to have a jos with a enough vacation time. <TS><TR>I believe</TR> plenty of vacation time have a productive influence on people’s lives because those with a enough personal time can work efficiently by recharging their lives mentally and physically. <TR>In addition</TR>, they can learn useful skills by using their vacation time properly.</TS></IN>

   <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, a sufficant vacation time allows people to revitalize their lives both physically and mentally and thus they can work more energetically.</MI1> <SI1>As our society is developing continously, people suffer from severe competitions. Mordern people’s  lives are becoming more and more exhausted and  stressful and thus they need enough time to rest and refresh. <EX>A research released by the Ministry of Labour investigated the relationship between the intensity of job and mood disorders. The research shows that the more time they work, the more depression they are prone to.  Individuals who have a higer ratio of work than rest are suscepible to mood diseases such as depression and this problem make a severe decreasing of their productivity.

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, a vacation time can be used to develop their abilities by learning positive skills.</MI2> <SI2>It is hard for workers to have enough time to develop themselves because of works they have to do in a certain period of time.

I decided to use my vacation, but my vacation was too short to cover the period of course.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people decide whether to buy or not through deep consideration because their money is limited.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In general</TR>, budget is tight so that is not enough to buy what they really want. <TR>Thus</TR>, it is irrational that people decide their purchase based on other’s preference. <TR>In other words</TR>, due to lack of their budget, they put their demands above popularity when they go shopping. <EX>According to recent studies on customer’s purchase pattern, most people determine their purchase by plan.

507&Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Peopld learn more by watching TV than reading books.

Others have the opposite opinion. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I agree with the statement. <TR>This is because</TR> TV delivers information with more interesting and offers up-to-date information.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, TV contents are more interesting and enjoyable than that of books. People learn better through TV than books.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, most people who lead busy lives or inclination to read books, but they enjoy watching TV. The Discovery channel and other nature documentaries are normally quite popular among viewers. <TR>In contrasts</TR>, not many people like to read nature or science in public libraries or book stores.</EX> <EX><TR>Furthermore</TR>, most historical dramas give entertainment and educational information to viewers. <TR>However</TR>, not many people enjoy reading books which is lengthy and boring.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, speaking skill represents one’s idea more efficiently.</MI1> <SI1>An important reason is that when it comes to complaining, written complaints lack visual and tangible proof. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, meeting in person enables customers to present their concrete evidence by showing defective products with the voice. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I worked in a restaurant.

514&An inexperienced worker at a lower salary is better than an experienced worker at a higher salary?,::,"<IN>Some people say that an inexperienced  woker is better than an experienced one because a company should pay more for an expert. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>I believe</TR> the use of expertes is better to develop companies. This is not only because they can make their companies more productive, but also because companies should spend large amount of money and time teaching their inexprienced employees.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, experienced employees as an expert have a productive influence on their companies.</MI1> <SI1>In order to be an dexterous worker in one field, they have to spend a substantial amount of time and effort. <TR>In addition</TR>,  good adroit workers can manage their work efficiently and get overcome any hardships using their experiences. <EX><TR>To take my personal experience for an example</TR>,  I as a physical therapist had to treat a variety of patients. <TR>However</TR>, when I was a complete novice,  I tended to have trouble treating  patients who have special diseases. It made me frustated because of the limited knowledge and experience that I have, and thuse I asked other physical therapist with a long experience to treat such patients. He treated them successfully as well as got patients’ trust. From his work,  I realized how important experience is.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, it is a necessary factor for companies to hire experienced employees  in order to improve their productivity.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, companies should spend  more money and time teaching  novices than hiring experts.</MI1> <SI1>Companies could not expect the direct productivity of inexperienced employees because they need enough time to adapt their work place and process. <TR>Besides</TR>, companies should give them plentiful oppotunities to build their abilities. <EX>A research released by the Misnistry of Labour in Korea shows that most companies are inclined to hire adroit workers because of their productivity and availability. This tendency is becoming more and more strengthened. <TR>In this sence</TR>, the use of experts is more efficient to improve companies’ outcomes.</EX></SI2></BO2>

After the performance, you can relieve the experience together while talking about favorite scene and lines. These activities will strengthen bonds with your friends and provide opportunities to make new friends. <EX><TR>Let me take experience as an example</TR>. Before going to high school, I was very reserved and did not have many friends. <TR>Then</TR>, on the first year of school, I participated in art conference holding government. At the conference, I met Eugene. He was very funny and witty, and popular with people in conference. He especially liked to draw picture and then he taught me about his picture's feature. We spent quality time together while drawing picture and watching many pictures in conference. <TR>As a result</TR>, our friendship grew stronger, and I became much sociable and outgoing.</EX></SI1></BO1>

516&The most important thing that government can do to improve the public health care is to clean the environment.,::,"<IN>Some people argue that the most important role of government to improve the public health care is to clean the environment. It is true that maintaining healthy atmosphere is one of key role of government. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>I believe that</TR> offering the national medical insurances is more important to improve the condition of public health. <TR>First</TR>, a number of people who have personal insurances covering their medical expenses insufficiently could recover through national insurance. <TR>Also</TR>, national medical insurance will contribute to the development of medical services and environment of heath care.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, national health care policy will provide proper medical treatments to people who really need help.</MI1> <SI1>When people with lower salaries get disease, most of them suffer from financial difficulties because they don’t have decent insurance.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, the expansion of medical insurance provided by government has positive effects on the medical industry and the advance of health care.</MI2> <SI2>This policy will stimulate medical companies to invest their money into research and development. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, according to studies conducted by Seoul National University, when government increased budget to medical insurance medical companies such as drug manufacturing companies and medical equipments companies spend more money into development of new technology.</EX><TR> It is no doubtful that</TR> enhancement of medical technology brings us development of the general health care.</SI2></BO2>

People from different walks of life may take different stance on this issue. <TS><TR>Personally</TR>, I disagree people have positive influence on movies and television such as advertisements.</TS></IN>
    
     <BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, Movies and television in advertisements often mislead people with biased information about products.</MI1> <SI1>Today, companies compete fiercely to lead the market and bombard consumers which are teenagers with images and sounds. The problem is that in order to grab people's attention and sell more products, these advertisements highlight only the product's positive aspects. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, When I was in young age, I watched a TV commercial about digital music player. It emphasized the player's compatibility with various sound file formats and its excellent design. Although I already owned a digital music player and had no plan to buy a new one, I was fascinated by the product's features and decided to buy it. My uncle, a tech savvy early adapter, advised me to wait a better vision. <TR>However</TR>, I was too excited to give a second thought about my decision and went ahaed to buy it. Now long afterward, I found that it did not have a random-play function, which is a basic function of almost every digital music player.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
     <BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, inappropriate content in movies and television, such as sex and violence, makes teenagers reckless and aggressive.</MI2> <SI2>Today, many commercials in TV and movies use sexual images and symbols to appeal to more consumers. Teenager's are easy to target of this strategy becaues they lack a sense of morality and judgment. When constantly exposed to such advertisements, young children and teenagers are likely to be impulsive in their thoughts and behavior. <EX>A study by Seoul National University in Korea showed that the number of violent and suggestive scenes in television commercials has more than tripled over the past five years.

518&Improving schools is the most important factor in the successful development of a country.,::,"<IN>Schools are places for students of various age groups to learn or get more knowledge. Nowadays, many countries around the world have compulsory education systems in which children and young adults have to go to the school for certain years to receive the least amount of education that the government thinks is needed. <TS><TR>Personally</TR>, <TR>I agree with the statement that</TR> improving schools is the most important factor in the successful development of a country.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, students not only gain knowledge from the school, but they also learn how to live their lives.</MI1> <SI1><EX>By studying and working with friends or classmates, students learn how to socialize. They learn how to respect other people, how to share and how to be caring for other people.</EX> Even if a person has an exceptionally high level of knowledge, without these skills learnt from the school, it may be hard for him to survive in the community.</SI1></BO1>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Finally</TR>, schools are places where the students dream and decide their future.</MI3> <SI3><TR>As mentioned above</TR>, the students are the country's future generation.

519&  People can learn more from watching TV than from reading books.,::,"<IN><TR>These days</TR>, a substantial number of people believe that they can learn more by reading a book because there is a lot of useful information. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>contrary to this notion</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> watching TV gives more benefits for our life. The compelling logic behind this is that watching TV will give family bonding and entertainments.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, TV brings family in one place.</MI1> <SI1>An important reason is that TV gives topics or subjects which promote to interact or communicate among family members. <TR>In contrast</TR>, reading a book separates family member because they just stuck in the room and read in a remote area. <TR>Therefore</TR>, TV will enhance the family’s relationship. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my family did not communicate well because they were busily occupied with their own chores. <TR>However</TR>, after we watched movie on TV which was about the love, we started to share some impression and opinion about the movie.</EX> <TR>In this respect</TR>, TV can give a special family gathering.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, watching TV is fun and relaxable.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is largely because</TR> TV is full of intriguing programs ranging from comedies to TV shows. <TR>What is more</TR>, this kind of programs also relieves one’s stress which comes from work or study. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, book sometimes gives more stress to children because they can feel it is also a studying time. <EX><TR>From my experience</TR>, I had a lot of assignments to do.

"520&In order to truly understand the world events, we must read newspaper; TV news does not provide enough information.",::,"<IN>It is often said that people must read newspaper in order to truly understand the world events and TV news does not provide enough information. <TS><TR>As for me</TR>, I strongly agree with this idea. <TR>The rationale behind this is that</TR> people tend to be passive receivers when they watch TV. <TR>Also</TR>, newspapers are dealt with a certain issue deeper than TV news does.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, watching TV makes people passive receivers and it reduces people's ability to get information more accurately.</MI1> <SI1>TV news provides both sound and pictures and what people have to do is just watching it. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, when people read a newspaper, they have to be more involved to get information. Reading requires people to concentrate on the information. <EX>A recent study shown that a group of persons who read newspaper remembered the details of a certain issue 37 percent better than those in the group of watching same issue on TV.</EX> <TR>This experiment reflects that</TR> reading newspaper is far better method to get and understand information.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, news paper tends to deal with events deeper that TV news does.</MI2> <SI2>In most newspapers, there are special sections for some issues that attract many people's attentions. In these sections, the information is dealt with considerable understanding and details. This helps people go deep enough to a certain issue. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, in the newspaper named Daily Economy, there was special section for a president election issue.

521&Government funds should be used to explore outer space rather than to solve problems on Earth.,::,"<IN>After the lunar landing of the Apollo 11, the outer space became a hot place for exploring.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, problems on Earth are closely related to people's life.</MI1> <SI1>If government does not solve those problems, they will jeopardize people's life. <TR>On the contrast</TR>, adventure on outer space is merely for people's curiosity. Even if government does not provide funds for exploring outer space, people may not be affected with the change. As government has a duty to improve citizen's life, government funds should be used to solve problems on Earth. <EX>In the last U.S president election, we can easily that people are interested to how to solve their problems when considering that the candidates mainly debated on economic issues.</EX> <EX><TR>Also</TR>, in the survey of American statistics of 2012, 76 percentage of U.S citizens responded that economic issues are more important than universe development.</EX> <TR>In the regard</TR>, government funds should be firstly placed on the problems on Earth rather than exploring outer space.</SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, exploring outer space requires huge amount of money.</MI2> <SI2>By the same amount of money, we can save a myriad of people who mired in problems. A flying on space needs millions of dollar and developing one spacecraft requires billions of dollar. Compared the amount of money, we cannot expect much of benefits from the exploring. As the budget of government is limited, if exploring outer space spends a large proportion of money, government should cut the budget for others such as a medical insurance. <TR>Therefore</TR>, the extravagant expense for the exploring will lower the quality of citizen's life. <EX>In the field of history, the Soviet Union was devoted to explore outer space to propagandize the Communism. <TR>However</TR>, the Soviet Union ignored their citizens' problems. Over time, their life became worse and worse. <TR>In the end</TR>, the space program could not save the fall of the Soviet Union.</EX> When considering this compelling example, government should place a large amount of money for solving their people's problems.</SI2></BO2>
 
 <CO><TR>Hence</TR>, we can conclude that government funds should used to solve their citizens' problems. <TR>Above all</TR>, government could ameliorate the quality of people's life by solving their problems.

"524&For university professors, educating students is more important than doing research",::,"<IN>Some people say that university professors should focus their academic goal on imparting the knowledge to their students. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this opinion for the following reasons. <TR>First</TR>, university professors can enable their students to have an up to date knowledge by steadily researching their field of study. <TR>In addition</TR>, they can help their students improve their own research skills.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, students can acquire the state of the art information from their professors continousely devoted to studying in their fields.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Nowadays</TR>, the range of the professional knowledge is becomming more and more broadened and added with the latest information. <TR>In this context</TR>, the constant researching is inevitable factor to keep up with this circumstance. <EX>A survey released by the Ministry of Education in Korea shows that a substantional number of professors felt  the limitation to teach their students requiring the newest knowledge and they were hard to satisfy them with an outdated knowledge. <TR>Therefore</TR>, they had to study and research the latest knowledge to meet with these demands.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, professors can enable their students to study the latest knowledge by doing research.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, professors allow students to build their own research skills by sharing reseach processes.</MI2> <SI2>Most student might forget most of the knowledge they learned in university, but the research skills they learned from their professor would be existed for the rest of thier lives and such skills help them do better their jobs or futher studies. <EX><TR>To take my experince for an example</TR>, when I was a graduate student, I had a hard time researching a variety of tasks related to my major with my professor.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the amount of advertisements is excessive and deprives people of their valuable time.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Today</TR>, people are exposed to an enormous amount of advertisement. When they turned on computers, what they first encounter is must be advertisements. Sometimes, these countless advertisement acts as waste of time. <EX><TR>Let me give you an example.</TR> Several months ago, I turned on TV to watch movies. On movie channel, CGV, I can saw a Korean film named Haeundae. <TR>However</TR>, in the middle of watching movie, suddenly the movie was stopped and replaced with advertising.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, broadcasting system also offers a wide array of channels which are absolutely beneficial for children such as educational or science channel.</MI1> <SI1>Many of students extremely like those channels due to the fact that they do not need to charge any money and they could watch no matter when they want. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, many of individuals have a strange stereotype that there are only entertained channels on TV. <TR>Hence</TR>, parents are likely to restrict their children to watch TV. <EX>According to the Harvard University, 40 percents of channels has to do with education for children and rest of them have to do with entertainment.</EX> <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was a student, I watched educational channel in lieu of going academies.

           <BO1><I1><TR>First</TR>, friends who help people are possible to encourage their friend who are overwhelmed by enormous task at work and school.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Basically</TR>, heavy workloads often exhaust students.

After my first year of high school, I started losing my grip on math and my confidence to succeed in the subject. My mother tried to encourage me, but their efforts did not help at all. Then, my friend, Kenny who is an honor student in my class lent me a helping hand. With a good sense of humor and a gentle personality, he was popular among students and respected by them.

           <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, getting advice from others does not necessarily mean that you can make right decisions.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is because</TR> people around you, no matter how close to you they are, do not know exactly what the situation you are in.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, TV brings family in one place.</MI1> <SI1><TR>An important reason is that</TR> TV gives topics or subjects which promote to interact or communicate among family members. <TR>In contrast</TR>, reading a book separates family member because they just stuck in the room and read in a remote area. <TR>Therefore</TR>, TV will enhance the family’s relationship. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my family did not communicate well because they were busily occupied with their own chores.

535&The only movies worth watching are movies that can give us lessons about real life.,::,"<IN>It is evident that in our current society leisure activities have a tremendous importance in our lives. Some people think that the only movies worth watching are movies that can give us lessons about real life while others do not. <TS>I however believe that the only movies worth watching are not necessarily movies that can give us lessons about real life. There are several reasons that I could discuss to support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. <TR>First</TR>, people receive stress. <TR>Also</TR>, people can succeed.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people receive stress.</MI1> <SI1>Commonly in society, people tend to be stressed out. If people watch movies which are designated, they will receive a lot of stress which leads to health problems. <EX>This reminds me of a time when I was in college. I struggled from stress because I could not watch the comedy movies. My parents prevent me watching the comedy movies because the movies were wasteful and dispensable. I could not sleep for 2 weeks because I felt uneasy. I even had to get treated at the hospital because I had an ulcer. If I had watched comedy movies, I would have relived my stress from my schoolwork.</EX> I am not totally dismissing the importance of the movies worth watching but the movies which people want to see give less stress.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Another reason for my thinking this way is</TR> people can succeed.</MI2> <SI2>Companies prefer people who have expertise. <TR>Thus</TR> it can be said that the only movies worth watching are not necessarily movies that can give us lessons about real life because some movies make people get expertise in specific fields. <EX>A really good example can be seen in Steve Jobs. I read online that Jobs, the former CEO of Apple Company transferred his company into one of the most profitable information technology enterprises in the world because he watched diverse movies. During one of his interviews Jobs said that he was able to do this because he frequently watched the movies about SF. This helped him learn how to provoke the imaginary and creativity when he is developing a new information technology device and idea.</EX> <TR>As this outcome clearly shows that</TR> the only movies worth watching are not necessarily movies that can give us lessons about real life because people can become more successful.</SI2></BO2>

536&Movies and TVs affect children negatively.,::,"<IN>Many parents worry that their children watch TV and movie too much. Their concern grows bigger when they hear the news that the adolescent delinquency has increased significantly due to the TV and movie. <TS>I agree with the statement, because I think TV and movie can affect children negatively. My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, watching violent activities in the TV or movie can increase the children's tendency to imitate, which causes the increasing of the adolescence delinquency rate.</MI1> <SI1>Many study results show that children lack the self-defendant characteristic, which means that they have a tendency to accept what they watch on the screen, not knowing whether it is right or wrong, whereas adults are mature enough to resist the wrong things. <TR>Moreover</TR>, the youth do think that adopting the criminal behavior what they watch is fascinating and help attract the popularity among friends. <EX>Some interviews clearly support this argument, as the teenagers who committed crime said that they just did what they watched on the TV or movie, for they could be famous among comrades by doing this kind of activity.</EX> <TR>Thus</TR> it is wise to restrict watching TV and movies, to lessen the rate of the teenager's criminal behavior.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, TV and movie make viewer too passive and unable to think wisely.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words</TR>, we just passively watch what there are on the screen and do not reflect whether it is true, good, or meaningful to the life. Our modern society requires the smart people, who can think ingeniously and make the creative solution. To build up such ability, people should think actively and approach matters from a various point of view, especially from the young age. <TR>However</TR>, watching TV and movies does not help build up such ability. When we analyze the children's pattern of watching TV and movies, we can conclude that children become passive and uncritically accept what they watch. <EX><TR>One research clearly shows why this is hazardous to our society.</TR> According to a study conducted by a Princeton University communication professor, the score of how people think creatively decreases significantly, average 4.3 point out of 5 in 1970 to 2.5 point out of 5 in 2000. The professor finds that the reason is due to the affect of watching TV and movie, which harms the thinking power of the children.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> we had better limit the children's exposure time to TV and movies, because it can reduce the crime and improve the creativity.

Advertising helps us enhance our quality of life by informing us of new products.",::,"<IN>As we are able to find many advertisements around us, there is a controversy about the role of advertisements. <TS><TR>However</TR> <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> advertising helps us enhance our quality of life by informing us about new products, because it makes the price lower, and also inform us about new products extensively.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, advertising provides us with a valuable service, by informing the public of new, useful products on the market.</MI1> <SI1>We can find advertisements easily in normal lives, such as television, internet and even in subway stations.

"538&For the successful development of the country, the government should spend more money on very young children(the age five to ten) than on the university education",::,"<IN>Some people say that the government should spend more money on very young children than on the university education in order to develop the country. <TS><TR>However</TR>, the investment in the university education is more lucrative to develop the country. This is not only because the university education is more closely related to the practical use of the technology and the economy, but also because home education more play a significant role in the very young children education than public education the government invests in.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the university education is more feasible to develop the country.</MI1> <SI1>A variety of technologies and sciences studied at unversities provide their country with a myriad of lucrative information. <EX>A research released by the Ministry of Labour in Korea investigated the cooperation between universities and companies.

541&Governments should pay attention to health care issues rather than environmental issues. Do you agree of disagree?,::,"<IN>These days, many people argue that governments should pay attention to health care issues instead of environmental issues, saying that humans are the most important thing in the earth. They think that it is the government's priorities to pay attention to health care issues. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this argument and believe that paying attention to environmental issues is more important. My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, concentrating on environmental issues is a more effective way in terms of the equity.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, we can have more desirable outcomes by having our priorities on environmental issues, to accomplish the fairness among people. If the government has to make a plan to treat each person's health care issues, it faces the harsh conflict. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, it is difficult to make a decision who should be the first to be treated to improve their health condition, as there are so many people who need treatment but the ability of governments is limited. That is, setting the priority among people is hard to make, especially when it comes to health care issues. <TR>However</TR>, environmental issues can be escaped from this kind of conflicts of interests. As the environment usually affects all of the people living in that area, we can avoid such conflicts, who were firstly treated and why they were chosen. Considering the limitation of finance, it is better to adopt the policy which can affect as many people as possible. <EX><TR>There is a good example in South Korea.</TR> The Korean government once implemented the policy called, 'Are you sick? Then go to neighborhood hospital out of our financial support,' which was made to improve the each individual's health. However, as the government could not give clear reasons who should be the first to be cared, many people insisted that they should be the first beneficiary from the policy, which made a big fuss in the society. After the government changed its policy from treating each person's health care to focusing on to improve the overall quality of the environment, it could implement its policy smoothly and achieved the goal.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, focusing on the environmental issues is a fundamental way to tackle the health care issues.</MI2> <SI2><TR>We know that</TR> when we want to solve the problem, we had better approach it not from the scratch, but from the core. As many health-related issues, such as the contagious disease like SARS, are generally caused by the pollution of the environment, it is better to focus on the environmental issues, in that this approach can eradicate the core reason of the problems. <EX>According to a study conducted by a Harvard University professor, 82% of the health care issues is derived from the environmental ones. <TR>For example</TR>, as the air quality in New York became exacerbated, patients suffering from bronchitis increased significantly, from 2.5 people in 2000 to 10.3 in 2010 per thousand. <TR>This result clearly shows that</TR> we cannot take root of the fundamental reasons if we just look at the health care issues.</EX> <TR>Rather</TR>, it will be wise to focus on the environmental issues, like the air pollution and water pollution. Especially, my county's action can be a good example. Instead of treating each person's health care issues, the local government put its budgets into cleaning the polluted riverside. After the measure, the satisfaction rate of the quality of life increased dramatically among citizens.</SI2></BO2>

My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, older people have more money to enjoy their life.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To put in another way</TR>, as the old generally have a high-paying job with a decent pay, they can enjoy whatever they want to the most, without financial difficulties. In common case, the old have saved a lot of money throughout their life. <TR>Consequently</TR>, they are able to spend their time experiencing a wide range of interesting things by using their savings. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, many people want to go abroad to travel, experiencing exotic cultures. It requires lots of money, such as a flight fee, a lodging fee, etc. I am a big fan of art galleries in Europe, especially the Louvre and really hope to visit it, but I cannot go because of the short of money. As it cost me about $3,000 for a week to go there, I had no choice but to stay home. <TR>In contrast</TR>, my parents had enough money to go to Europe, they could visit the Louvre and see famous paintings and sculptors.</EX> <TR>From this example</TR>, we can say that old people can enjoy their life fully.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Not only that</TR>, but older people also have more free time.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words</TR>, they can spend their time freely, not worrying about going to work or school. They face a different life style after retirement, escaping from any kinds of obligations and duties in the workplace. <TR>Thus</TR>, they have more chance to go anywhere they have wanted and enjoy their life. Even if young people have more money, it is impossible for them to have fun if they should do their duties. <TR>However</TR>, older people have lots of free time, so their chances of enjoying their life are high. <EX>A professor in Princeton university investigated whether this argument was true. <TR>According to the study</TR>, 791 people out of 1000 who were surveyed answered that they had more time to enjoy their life after retirement, than they had at the young age. As they retired from the work and had nothing special to do for their rest of life, they were more aggressive to spend their time doing special things that they had dreamed of.</EX> <TR>This point illustrates that</TR> older people are more likely to get the enjoyment from their life.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> the advertising copy I mentioned at the first paragraph, which emphasized the superiority of the youth over the senior in terms of enjoying one's life, is wrong.

<BO1><MI1><TR>The first point that I would like to make is that</TR> art and music is disposed to make people feel calm and safe.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In this regard</TR>, students are able to find mental asylum through studying them. <EX><TR>Take my experience as an example.</TR> When I was in high school, It was very difficult to endure tons of stress which was coming from academic studies, <TR>however</TR>, I could face it and relieved my state by music I heard in the music class and pictures I saw in the art classroom; <TR>actually</TR>, I always waited for those classes. If it had not been for such a courses, I would have difficulties handling my heavy school life.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Another compelling reason is that</TR> art and music play a critical role in developing emotion.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This clearly illustrates that</TR> schools, which have responsibility to raise their students' ability both inside and outside, should teach  the students art and music in order to balance emotional and academic capacity. <EX>A recent study by the Institution of Education of Korea found that student who studies art and music is generally good at sympathizing others than who doesn't. <TR>Therefore</TR> I could come up with the idea that art and music can change human more humane.</EX></SI2></BO2>

547&Successful people are willing to try new things and take risks.,::," <IN>In modern society, people lionize leaders who break new ground in their fields. In a variety of their characteristics, some people place emphasis on courage which try to new things and take risks. <TR>However</TR>, others strongly oppose this notion while degrading their courage as the temerity. <TS><TR>In this question</TR>, I agree with the aforementioned statement in that successful people constantly challenge themselves and try new things to be one step ahead in competition.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, only the ones, who know their current situation, can take risks to challenge new things.<.MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, taking risks provides a good opportunity to think about their pros and cons in solving problems. Then, they will know whether they can overcome their problems with new methods or not. When they become assured that they are able to succeed, they would try new things. <TR>And</TR>, I believe that these process are the first step for success. <EX><TR>In the field of history</TR>, the New Deal policy exactly shows the superiority of this process. In the Great Depression, people are mired in economic difficulty. The dispute lasted endlessly on how to revitalize the economy in congress and out. The president Roosevelt enacted unexpected policy named the New Deal policy. Since Roosevelt explicitly recognized what triggered the Great Depression, he could strongly argued that they can solve the present issue by directly intervening the economy. <TR>In fact</TR>, the policy was against implemented economic policies in the point that government regulate economic flow. However, Roosevelt implemented the policy. If Roosevelt hesitated to enact the policy, more people would be suffered with economic difficulty. <TR>In the end</TR>, his courage makes the New Deal policy as one of successful economic policies.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, taking risks raise people's ability to a higher level.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, trying new things makes people come into spotlight.</MI2> <SI2>People are interesting in the difference and people who challenge new things are different with mediocre ones. Even toddlers reveal sense of curiosity to new toys. <TR>Thus</TR>, people who want to win in competition should try new things even though it has some risks. <EX>Let's take Steve Jobs as an example for this. Jobs was the most successful CEO in business. The point that he was not afraid to try new things  makes him special. Especially, when Jobs announced the Apple will make mobile phones, any expert did not expect the success of his trial. <TR>However</TR>, Jobs showed a totally different type of cellular phones. It opened the Smart phone era. <TR>In this respect</TR>, challenge new things could be one of advantages for people who want to succeed in their fields.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO.<TR>Hence</TR>, <TR>if you consider what I mentioned before</TR>, <TR>it is not difficult to conclude that</TR> courage to try new things is the shortcut for succeeding. <TR>Above all</TR>, by taking risks, people would go an extra mile to solve their problems.

"548&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? 
The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.",::,"<IN>Opinions vary whether or not the ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past. <TS><TR>Personally</TR>, I disagree with the statement for following two reasons. <TR>Firstly</TR>, things that required cooperation in the past are now possible to be done individually.  <TR>Also</TR>, we can maximize efficiency by working alone.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, cooperation is not as much as an important value than in the past.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In the past</TR>, people had to work together and rely on each other, since there were few ways that they could get information from. <TR>However</TR>, now we are living in a technologically developed society, thus, we could  easily access to internet or television news which we could get information we want. <TR>In this context</TR>, it is not necessary to work with other people anymore.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, we could complete our works more quickly and accurately without cooperation.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In today’s society</TR>, we face fierce competition, thus, we have to work more than ever to survive in this jungle like society. The problem with this is that, we are often unable complete the heavy load of works in time. <TR>Thereby</TR>, it is significant to work alone to save time for our works since it helps us to avoid the problems of wasting time that cooperation may bring. <EX><TR>Let’s take my case in point.</TR> Last semester I took a class about ancient culture and had to work on a project in a group. I suggested members to research about Asian culture as I was originally interested in it. <TR>However</TR>, each member preferred different topic and we had to spend extra time selecting a topic.

<CO><TR>To conclude</TR>, <TR>it can be argued that</TR> working together is less important in today than in the past.

549&Most business people are motivated entierly by money.,::,"<IN>There is an argument wether most business people are motivated entirely by money.
Some people believe the statement is totally right because the more price they cut back on, the more benefits they will earn. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>in my opinion</TR>, there are a couple of things that are more important than money in business; details and quailty. <TR>In this essay</TR>, I will explore the importance of these things.</TS></IN> 

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, some business men considering product's details have achived success in their field.</MI1> <SI1>Having considered only prices, they would not have had achivement. <EX>Steve Jobs, who founded the Apple company in the United State of America, is a good example to explain the importance of details. He had tried to make a special device that not only contains high technologies, but also includes a variety of visual details. <TR>As a result</TR>, he created i-Phone, which is on the top of the smartphone market all around the world. Looking at i-Phone, you will find that it includes a lot of attractive details that Steve Jobs wanted it to; old casette recorder image in music player, well-shaped application icons and cute appearance. According to a report conducted by a team of reaserchers in Washington Posts, two-thirds of people who bought the i-Phone mentioned that they had purchased it due to the visual details. Had it not been for his eagerness for datails, i-Phones would never have got success in the world market.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, consumer preference for cheaper product changed with the times.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is because</TR> the quality of life has been improved by economic development. <TR>In the old days</TR>, people used to stick to reasonably priced items because they want to cut back their budget. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, nowadays many people started to want luxury brands as they can afford them. <TR>It means</TR> the quality of product has become more important than prices for people in modern society. <EX>According to a survey conducted by a team of researchers in New York Times, 88 percentages of people living in Manhatten prefer to buy well-made items to get cheaper ones. <TR>As the research shows</TR>, customers' preference has changed in comparison to the past. </EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, customers preference has changed over the years.

550&It is impossible to completely be honest with your friends.,::,"<IN><TS><TR>I agree with the argument that</TR> it is impossible to completely be honest with friends. Sometimes people have no choice but to lie to their friends. <TR>First</TR>, they lie to keep hiding their own weakness. <TR>Additionally</TR>, they think that it is better to lie than to face uncomfortable situations.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, all people lie to their friends because they have a tendency to conceal their flaws and mistakes by telling lies.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, most people want to be popular in the group, especially among their mates. They are afraid to show their negative aspects. <TR>This is because</TR> unfavorable facts will reduce their attraction and reputation. <EX><TR>Take my personal experience as an example.</TR> When I was in high school, I really wanted to get along with my class mates. Online computer game called ‘Starcraft’ was so popular at that time. It seems that they like a person who is good at playing starcraft. So I pretended that I am a really good player even though I just played that game once or twice. My parents always stressed me to be a faithful friend however, I have to lie to my friends becuase it is more important for me to get attention instantly from my mates.</EX> This example is shown the reason why people are not always innocent to their friends.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, people tell an untruth because they really hate to debate with their friends.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words></TR>, people think that it is better to tell false stories than to make relationship worse.

551&A job has greater influences on the overall happiness than a social life,::,"<IN>In complicated society, various factors influence the overall happiness such as money, human relation and job. <TS><TR>I believe</TR> the most important factor to decide a level of happiness is a social life rather than work. Having family and good friends allow people to feel self-esteem and relieve their stress levels.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, a closed relationship with friends and family members enables people to realize that they themselves are important and valuable people for someone.</MI1> <SI1>Well-rounded relationship influences their self-confidence and self-esteem. <EX>According to A-San hospital's statistics, people who do not have closed friends, have a fight with friends seriously or recently get divorced usually feel a sense of isolation and some of them need to take medicine for reducing their depression. <TR>This is because</TR> people can not live alone and it is inborn tendency.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, in order to manage their lives happily, a social life is necessary for people.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second of all</TR>, spending time with friends and family offers people to relieve tension and their high stress from daily lives.</MI2> <SI2><TR>Nowadays</TR>, many people are tied up with busy schedules and overwhelmed with numerous stuffs due to works and study. <TR>However</TR>, spending their extra time with closed people such as family empowers them to prepare for the next day. <TR>In addition</TR>, they are able to forget about their daily lives and thus feel happiness. <EX><TR>Take my personal experience as an example.</TR> When I am stressed out, I attempt to talk with my friends or watch movies together. <TR>This is because</TR> they are understanding and willing to understand my problems very well. <TR>As a result</TR>, they enable me to laugh and feel pleasant.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a multitude of exhibition in museum reflects the flow of history.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In detail</TR>, people are able to grasp the current of the time in a few hours by looking around in museum.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, museums provide people with more reliable information about a country’s history.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is attributed to the reason that</TR> many specialists and experts are responsible for examining the relics  to   prove that they are genuine. <TR>In addition</TR>, people can obtain a variety of information on the online simply. <EX><TR>But</TR>, according to the article, over 30 percent of it is prove to be faithless.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, junk food is severe problem in contemporary society, which there was no in the past.</MI1> <SI1>Although the majority of junk food companies highlights a delicious taste of their products, these foods are not nutritious and full of harmful elements. <EX>To take McDonald for instance, the foods are comprised of hamburger that has unhealthy and unsanitary meat, French-fried potato that have substantial calorie, and Coke that are harmful to bones and teeth.</EX> With these unhealthy diets, frequency people today are hospitalized is increasing more and more. <TR>In addition</TR>, it is fairly common for a lot of people to be fattened.  <EX>Evidence for this comes from a study by Korea National Statistics Korea.

There are a couple of reasons that could validate my position.</TS></IN>
<BO1><MI1><TR>The first point i would like to make is that</TR> people could not know about their future whether there are dangers which might need a considerable amount of money.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In this regard</TR>, saving money can be a best method to prepare for it like insurance rather than waste them to near meaningless entertaining stuffs. <EX>A recent study shows that who save money for their future  are more durable to face unexpected events and circumstances both in monetary and even in psychologic regard.</EX></SI1></BO1>

There are several reasons for why I agree with this perception and I want to delve into some of the most significant ones here.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people who work in a company where they can often take off are able to live in more enjoyable lives.</MI1> <SI1>Money is important in our society, but it is not the most. Working is highly stressful and irritated due to the fact that people are always forced to achieve something and have to keep contact with other fellows. Even though they can make much money, they are not happy with their work and in their lives. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, those who frequently have a vacation can enjoy their lives with relaxed and laidback attitude. There is much leisure people can be fond of and they can such as watching movies or concerts, appreciating works of art in the museum and just walking around park. These lives seem to be more enjoyable and happier. <EX>According to a recent study released by the Korean National Research Center, the level of the sense of happiness is much higher to the people who sporadically take off with low salary than those who work hard with high one.</EX> <TR>This study shows that</TR> those who put more effort on enjoyable lives usually feel more happiness.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, having a vacation enables people to go on a trip.</MI2> <SI2>Most of people cannot take a trip because they always busy working at the firm. They really want to go to anywhere out of the company, but just do imagine. <TR>However</TR>, travel provides people with many valuable things such as priceless experiences, enjoyable memories and relieving stress of daily life. <TR>Moreover</TR>, it can broaden and deepen their understanding of the world, while providing new and special perspectives.

Another friend who work at a small company often go on a trip during his intermittent vacation with his a little low salary, but he said that he is happy and enjoy his life.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>In my opinion</TR>, when the students move to a new school, previous school has to suggest new schools which are able to prevent to happen same problems which they had before.</MI1> <SI1>In a new school, if the students have the same problems, there are no points to change a new education institution. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there is a student who wants to play instruments in a school, and desire to would be supported enough education of music. <TR>However</TR>, the school does not possess abounding finances for providing subject area.

And my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, we can relieve our stress by watching movies.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, movies can be worth watching not just for learning something, but for relaxing ourselves. It appears that movies can get rid of stress through various ways. The action genre makes us feel like a superman who can run as fast as cheetah, fly as high as eagles. The romantic movie makes us feel a true love. <TR>From this effect</TR>, it is possible to say that we humans live beyond the limit of real life, which helps us to relieve much stress. Relieving stress is crucial to enrich our life, because stresses usually cause many diseases, such as heart-attacks and strokes. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a high school student, I was exhausted by many study-related stresses and it caused harmful effect on my health, like dizziness. If it had not been for the movie, especially the fantasy movie 'The lord of the king' at that time, I would have not tolerated my stresses and kept my composure. With the help of this movie, I could leave away from the real life for a brief time.</EX> <TR>This example clearly illustrates that</TR> we need movies to keep our mental and physical health salubrious.</SI1></BO1>

Movies are a good instrument to bridge time-sharing and interests between people, as we can talk about movies after watching them. By sharing opinions with each other, we can understand his or her thoughts and interests, which help us to become close friends. <EX>According to a study conducted by Tokyo University's psychology professor, the most selected medium which was regarded as a best instrument to make friends was a 'movie.' <TR>They answered the reason was that</TR> those who chose the same movie and talked about this had a tendency to understand each other's position easily.</EX> <TR>This study firmly shows that</TR> movies are important even though they do not teach something about real life.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all</TR>, <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> movie is worth watching, not only it relieve the stress, but also it is a way to help us to make friends. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it would be wrong to argue that movie is worth watching only when they teach us something about real life.</CO>",::,4,::,2,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,"Despite the thesis statement not being specific enough, this student ends up with a strong argument, as his/her examples leading into them are very clear and thoughtful, and as the essay is generally very well-written, with a good flow that keeps it moving.",//
558&Physical exercise is more important for older people than younger people.,::,"<IN>There is an argument whether physical exercise is more important for older people than younger people. Some people believe that the statement is totally right because regular exercise make a person healthy and activate old people's blood circular. <TS><TR>My view</TR>, <TR>however</TR>, is that the old should not do exercise. <TR>This is largely because</TR> the old are more likely to be injured with exercise. <TR>Moreover</TR>, there are tons of other way to improve their health.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, older people can be badly injured by exercise, which give a sort of pressure on their body.</MI1> <SI1>It is very common that older people normally have a weaker body than younger people. <TR>Therefore</TR>, physical activity is going to do more harm than good. <EX>According to a study conducted by a team of Health and Welfare Center at Seoul University, people who are over the 60-year-old should reduce their physical activity as the density of their bones begin thinning. Two-thirds of old patients who are being treated in the center came with the problem caused to a sort of physical activities.</EX></SI1></BO1> 
 
<BO2><MI2>Instead of having a physical activity, there is a useful way to improve their health condition.    Food treatment is that.</MI2> <SI2>The saying &quotyou are what you eat&quot is something I totally believe in and I could find it from my personal experience. <EX>Just ten years ago, my grand mother suffered from Osteoporosis, which is related to leg bones, and thus she could not walk at all.

559&One can learn about a person from the type of friends that the person has.,::,"<IN>It is often said that one cannot learn about a person from the type of friends that the person has. <TS><TR>On the other hand</TR>, <TR>I believe that</TR> it is possible to learn about a person from the type of friends that the person has. <TR>This is because</TR> people tend to make friends who are similar to them for two reasons: to stay healthy and to broaden their horizon.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, making friends who have similar personalities allows people to stay healthy.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> when people make friends who are similar to them, they can avoid leading conflicts, which guarantees stress-free life, while making friends who are the opposite type of person can tress people out by making them worry about coming into conflicts. <TR>Moreover</TR>, stress is one of the main factors of diseases through weakening the immune system. <EX>According to a study conducted by Seoul National University of Korea in 2008, a test on mice showed that life span was shortened when they regularly underwent a series of electric shocks. <TR>Interestingly</TR>, the researchers found a link between this and human beings who suffered periodic stress.</EX> <TR>This implies that</TR> high stress levels coming from worrying about coming into conflicts can negatively affect human beings, resulting in a shorter life span.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, making friends who have similar personalities enables people to broaden their horizon.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is contributed to the fact that</TR> becoming a friend who is similar type of person can help understanding their different worlds of lifestyles, basic customs and cultures. Through this experience, they can learn to embrace diversity. This is especially important given the fact that modern society is becoming increasingly globalized. <EX><TR?For example</TR>, my youngest brother used to be narrow-minded which caused him to have few friends. <TR>However</TR>, he has changed little by little after having made new friends who were very similar to him. He realized that his narrow-mindedness could negatively affect his school life by delaying every step to survive, such as receiving tips related to schoolwork. <TR>Naturally</TR>, he became a social butterfly and a conversation starter by showing interest in sports events and parties.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In brief</TR>, although it seems hard to learn about a person from the type of friends that the person has, the advantages of understanding a person from the type of friends who has similar personalities cannot be underestimated for the reasons that I have mentioned above.

560&Friends are the most important infuence on young adults.,::,"<IN>Some people think that friends have the greatest impact on young adults. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>in my opinion</TR>, Family is the most important people on one’s life. <TR>This is because</TR> friend relationship called as ‘friendship’ is temporary, and family members are more bonded than friends.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, Friendship is formed only within certain situations such as schooling, playing, and journeys and so on.</MI1> <SI1>So even the closest friend only know certain aspects of young adult’s characteristics. <TR>Moreover</TR> as some social activities end up, such as commencement, friends go for their own pursuit of life. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I got married, and passed accountant exam, many of my friends celebrated me, and we have hung out with together. <TR>However</TR>, Who made the decision myself to get married, and study for exam?. A person’s decisions for important challenges such as future jobs and life vision are fundamentally made by oneself.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, family members know a person’s tendency and characters more accurately than friends.</MI2> <SI2><TR>Generally</TR> family members lives together for a long time. So they know each other by instinct even though they live separately far away right now. <EX>There is a saying that ’Blood is thicker than water’. Due to survival instinct claimed by evolution theory, family members care about each other most carefully than any other people. <TR>To be specific</TR>, when I got lung contraction problem, felt stomach and was carried by ambulance to hospital, mother, dad, and sister all came to hospital, and care for me sincerely.

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, although friends are sometimes heedful to young adults, they have own life, and don’t know a young adults perfectly. <TR>In contrast</TR>, family members are always with oneself. <TR>In this regard</TR>, I disagree with the statement that friends are the most important influence on young adult’s life.</CO>",::,2,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,2,::,"I don't feel like this student's examples and evidence really add much to the argument.

 <BO1><MI1>Kids under 5 years old could put themselves   into a dangerous situation by watching television advertisements.</MI1> <SI1>Since the   goal of advertising a product is to lead consumers to buy the product, advertisement   usually exaggerates the benefits that the product brings, and even provides false   information sometimes. The problem with this is, <TR>however</TR>, little children   have no idea to distinct which is true information and which is not. <EX>Take my   cousin’s case in point. <TR>One day</TR>, my cousin watched a tv advertisement of a   superman custom, showing a kid flying in the air with the custom on. My cousin   bought the custom, and he jumped from the roof as he thought he could fly like   the kid in the ad. <TR>As a result</TR>, he broke his arm.</EX> <TR>In this context</TR>, kids in   that age should not be permitted to watch the TV ads in the terms of the risk   they bring.</SI1></BO1>
  
 <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, little children could be easily   persuaded by the advertisement, thus, they consume products which are   needless.</MI2> <SI2>Kids in that age are usually obsessed with images and sounds rather   than the contents. <TR>Thereby</TR>, they easily get convinced by the advertisement   which focus mostly on providing images and sounds. <TR>What more worse is that</TR>,   children are influenced to desire products they don’t need.</SI2></BO2>

562&Physical exercise is more imporatnt for older people than for younger people. ,::," <IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether physical movement is more needed for older people than for younger people. The answer to this question can vary greatly, depending on individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, <TR>the jury may still be out</TR>, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR> I agree with the statement. <TR>In this essay</TR>, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the elderly have poor immunity, and often go through pain from weak bones or heart functions.</MI1> <SIS1>It can be enhanced by exercising regularly. The majority of doctors have recommended the importance of physical movement. <EX>Evidence for this comes from a study by Statistics Korea. According to to the study, older people who enjoy jogging every morning since they are the age of 30 have stronger anti-disease abilities. <TR>In addition</TR>, the rate they are hospitalized is extremely low than those who do not. </EX>This shows that it is fairly good for older people to do exercise for their health.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, there are substantial limitations that people with old age can be active. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, children take part in a variety of activities in school, academy, scout or even church. They naturally have relatively many opportunities to be energetic and refreshed.</MI2> <SI2><EX>I in person experienced this on many occasions, but the most notable example was when i was in high school. <TR>At that time</TR>, there were a myriad of clubs I partook in like chess club, soccer club, and girl scout. Roughly every weekend, I traveled with the member of the clubs or participated parties. With the activities, I could have strong body mentally and physically. <TR>However</TR>, my grand mother often felt lonely and inactive because she spend their virtually all time to stay at home. <TR>However</TR>, after she took part in exercising club for elderly, not only her physical health but also mentally health were better than the past.</EX></SI2></BO2> 

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. <TR>Once again</TR>, <TR>although the verdict may still be out</TR>, <TR>I personally believe that</TR> two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim.</CO>",::,4,::,2,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,"This student uses some strange phrasing and word order at times, but nothing that renders the essay confusing.

Some people might say television's purpose is the educatino and another people might say that it is important for television to entertain the people. <TS><TR>In my opinion</TR>, television have to be for entertainment because it reduece the people's stress and also it can keep the popularity.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the television for entertainment sooth people's nervous and reduce the people's stress.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is because</TR> when people see a enjoyable things, they forget about their hard things such as shcool test or personal relationship. <TR>Therefore</TR>, the television helps the people to forget their hard work and makes them enjoyable. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when i was middle shcool, i did not take the school test well. i was very depressed.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, if the television change for the enducation, they will lose their popularity.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is because</TR> most of the people are very tired because of their company or school or home working. <TR>Therefore</TR>, people usally want to see the enjoyable thing in order to reduce their stress. <TR>In these circumstance</TR>, if the television only pursue the educational program, they will lose their popularity. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, the studies that conduceted by a few professor have shown that the first reason why people watch the televion is that people can diminish their stress by watching the joyful program such as TV show or drama.

566&teachers should assign homework every day.,::,"<IN>With the advent of information age, technology frequently changes and people take an extra mile to learn cutting-edge technology for winning in the competition. <TR>Therefore</TR>, in the fast-paced society, it is important to become professional in their fields. <TR>In this respect</TR>, some people argues that teacher should assign homework every day to improve students competitiveness. <TR>However</TR>, others strongly oppose this notion in that excessive assignments would ruin students' capabilities. <TS><TR>On this question</TR>, I disagree with the aforementioned statement because study would be helpful to students when they realize necessity of the study.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, students should be convinced with the point that they can reach their goals with homework.</MI1> <SI1>If they consider the assignments as unnecessary works, everyday homework would become unwanted burdens. In this situation, even students do their homework every day, teachers cannot reap expected benefits from daily assignments. <TR>Hence</TR>, before to charge homework, teachers  help for student to set their goals and explain why homework is indispensable for their dreams. <TR>Moreover</TR>, when students establish their goals, they would find a way how to attain the goals. <TR>Accordingly</TR>, after school, students will do extra-curriculum activities which will broaden their experience for their dreams. <TR>Thus</TR>, if students do homework on a daily basis, it would impede their activities which would be helpful to students' future. Since education exists for student's better life, teachers should not interrupt student's voluntary activity by imposing daily homework. <EX>Let's take Albert Einstein as an example. Einstein placed an emphasis on student's willingness in study. <TR>In fact</TR>, Einstein took home-schooling instead of going school in that he refused to take unwanted classes and homework and focused on physics.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, students cannot ameliorate their creativity just by following school's homework.</MI2> <SI2>In modern society, not only state-of-the-art technology, but also creativity is important for people. Although students could be one of experts with learning many things in the short terms in many fields, they cannot be a leader without creativity in their fields. <TR>Thus</TR>, teachers should worry about the point that daily homework may not damage students' originality. <TR>In my opinion</TR>, regardless of students' characteristics, daily homework hamper students to broaden their thinking since the works take time of students after school. <EX>In the field of business, Steve Jobs took different way to broaden his knowledge by taking additional subjects in university. At first glance, the subject, the graphic art, was unrelated to his major, the computer engineering. <TR>Thus</TR>, others considered that taking the art class would be waste of time.

570&Getting a university education is the most important factor for success in life,::,"<IN>Some people think that getting a university education is the most important factor for success in life afterwards. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>personally</TR>, I do not agree with this statement and in my opinion, being successful is determined by a lot of aspects other than graduating university. <TR>There are two mains reasons for this</TR>: many effective and successful people out there did not get high level education and some crucial skills to achieve success cannot be obtained from university education.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, <TR>I think that</TR> studying in university is not a required factor to succeed and this can be proved by looking at some extremely successful people who only went to middle or high school.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For instance</TR>, Steve Jobs, who is the founder of Apple Inc., dropped out of Reed College after his first year because he knew going to university would not bring him success. Instead he started his own company and concentrated on designing new technological products. Even though he did not finish college, he had enough ability and basic knowledge to attain huge success with his novel inventions. He was the one who innovated the whole world by making computers which had a tremendous effect on our technology.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, there are many other things to be satisfied to be a successful person.

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, getting a university education definitely should not be considered as the most significant factor for success in life.

571&Children should be required to learn art and music. ,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether children should be required to learn art and music.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, art and music classes motivate children to focus efficiently on their academic performance.</MI1> <SI1><TR>It is completely obvious that</TR> art courses give students with an opportunity to relax their mind-set and relieve stress from the excessive academic works. <EX>According to a study conducted by a team of Art management departments at Paris University, appropriate aesthetic materials are easily able to comfort children's mind-set and make them being creative. <TR>Especially</TR>, classical music with serene atmosphere greatly improve children's concentration. <TR>As the study show</TR>, art and music class play an indispensable role in children's academic accomplishment.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, every course in class is linked with each other. Music and art class can not be exception.</MI1> <SI2><EX><TR>For example</TR>, my major is English literature and linguistic department and I am completely interested in English literature.

As I had already read about these concepts, I could apply them into my paper and I got good grades from every professor. Had it not been for these background knowledge, I would not have had good grades.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To summarize</TR>, art class has a profound influence on children on the grounds that the class motivate children to be creative, and every course is connected with each other. <TR>Of course</TR>, some people might say that such class will waste children's time to study.

572&Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion? ,::,"<IN>One of my friends has his own aphorism in his life, that is, 'Carpe diem.' This means that we human have to enjoy our life to the most whenever it is possible. Following this motto, he consumes his money as much as possible if he can afford to, so he does not have any savings in his bank accounts. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with his life style and firmly believe that we should save some money for some time in the future. And my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, saving money for future is helpful to succeed in our life.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, by accumulating some money in our bank accounts, we can prepare our future properly and successfully. To succeed in the present society, especially the society for materialism, usually means to learn much knowledge and get a good job. All of these things require some money, such as a high enrollment fee for a prestigious college, searching costs for a secure job with decent pay. So we can say that to be successful in our life, we need money to be used in pursuing our real dream. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I am a high-school student in a small country in South Korea. Although I live in a rural place, I have a big dream, to be a doctor. To become a doctor requires not only a good grade, but also a high enrollment fee. If I do not consider this fact and spend all of my belongings right now, I will not have enough money to enter the medical school in the near future, which will be regretful. It would be better to save my money for my big dream, even though I have to sacrifice the pleasure of the moment, as it helps me to pursue my real hope in my life.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, it is wise to hoard our money to prepare for some unexpected accidents.</MI2> <SI2>When we run into unexpected accidents, we need some money to prepare properly. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, we can have a sudden traffic accident or cancer surgery. Because we are not perfectly rational and cannot expect all of the happenings in the future, we had better save some money for these tragedies. In economic terms, savings for the future from this reason are referred as the 'precautionary savings.' <EX>According to a study conducted by a well-known professor in Tokyo University, those who saved 20% more from their wage in the banking accounts than the average level were more likely to afford their hospital fee for unexpected health problems. They could spend their money at once after this shock and cure the disease. Because treating big health problems like cancer and heart attack required lots of money, those who did not save much in an earlier stage could not go to hospitals.</EX> <TR>This example clearly supports the view that</TR> we need to save some money for our future.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, I recommend everyone in our society to save some money, compulsorily by government if it is possible, for it can help us to pursue our true dream and prepare for unexpected tragedy in our life. <TR>Hence</TR>, I think 'Carpe diem' should not be interpreted as an expression that supports we can spend our money as much as we can, but as a phrase that leads us to live faithfully and wisely, by seeing over the present.</CO>",::,5,::,2,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"Except for a weak, unspecific thesis, this is a very strong essay.

   <BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, a society wants the student that has knowledge in different field and various skills.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This is because</TR> we need various knowledge and skills to solve the problem of a society or a company. As a society develops, the issue that we have to handle became complex, and thus interdisciplinary knowledge is necessary to solve it. <EX><TR>For this reason</TR>, when Samsung performs project on new product, they make a task-force team compromising design expert, advertising expert, engineer and so on.

575&Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to intelligent students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.,::,"<IN>Society, as we know, has been drastically improved thanks to the improvements which human beings made. As time passed, education naturally has become a crucial part of our life. The students are divided into two groups such as good students or incompetent students. <TS>Almost all of the individuals believe that a university education should only produce students who are competent. <TR>However</TR>, <TR>in my eyes</TR>, I strongly disagree with them due to several grounds.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, a wide array of students will not be able to enroll the university due to the fact that 80 percentages of students are not as smart as genius.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Consequently</TR>, matriculating students decrease, university will not procure profits as much as they expected. <TR>Hence</TR>, this policy will be extremely impractical for university and students. <EX><TR>As an illustration</TR>, ancient Chinese could not obtain crucial job or role due to the fact that government and universities only coveted who were preeminent. <TR>As a result</TR>, thanks to this ridiculous policy, 90% percentages of Chinese individuals were illiteracy and ignorant since they could not procure proper education by government or university. <TR>Additionally</TR>, government did not earn funds as much as they anticipated.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, <TR>this example clearly illustrates that</TR> selecting students, who are only genius, is absolutely inefficient without any doubts.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, colleges will not be able to figure out students who have a magnificent potential.</MI2> <SI2>While educating students, professors naturally determine which students have a potential. <TR>However</TR>, in the event that universities only pick up competent students, they might not be satisfied with their future. <TR>Additionally</TR>, Students, who house a splendid potential, still have a great many of priceless opportunities. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my friend who named Jim was not intelligent but creative. <TR>What it means</TR>, he had a great deal of potential.

Unless university did not pick him, he had not been known for around individuals.</EX> <TR>As a result</TR>, choosing only good students is extremely detrimental and impractical by this reason.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, even though some people allege that university must choose genius students, I still disagree with them thanks to these two reasons which are mentioned in my essay.

576&A teacher's ability to reate with students is more important than to give knowledge.,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether which ability is more important for teachers - ability to relate with students or ability to give knowledge to students.

I will explore the importance of teachers who have ability to relate with their disciplines.</TS></IN> 
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, closeness with teachers make students less defendant.</MI1> <SI1><TR>It is no secret that</TR> people talk about their deep inside with more familiar friends rather than strangers. It is not common for students to talk their concerns with teachers who they are not familiar with. As students don't easily express their opinion or anxiety about academic performance to their teachers much, teachers have to try to open their mind. As long as students open their mind, teachers can help them to ask assistance or advice. <EX>According to a study conducted by a team of researchers at London University, children talk their concerns when placed in a favorable environment. This study also reveals that this condition gets even stronger as students enter adolescence.</EX> <TR>As the study show</TR>, friendly teachers have a profound influence on their students than others because they can provide the appropriate atmosphere for students to open their heart. </SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, as far as student's school work is concerned, teachers having a ability to be familiar with disciplines are able to make more interesting class.</MI2> <SI2>One of the biggest problems in class is that lots of students tend to rely on private education instead of believing in public school. <TR>Therefore</TR>, most students fall asleep in class as they have to study in the private educational institute late at night. This situation gets exacerbated while students are taking a class with unfamiliar teacher. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I used to fall a sleep in math class when I was in high school.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>Primarily</TR>, living with foreigners provides children with many different cultural experiences.</MI1> <SI1><TR>I firmly believe that</TR> wide range of experiences is important in childhood. <TR>Because</TR>, according to research, various experiences in childhood give children chances to feel many different emotions and this will help children’s cognitive development. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my cousin was born in Canada and she spent her childhood there. She learned Canadian cultures in school and Korean cultures at home with her family.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, I would like to take an example, Steve Jobs who is founder of APPLE.</MI1> <SI1>He already passed away few months ago, but he left his mark on history.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, those who have different traits fairly help people to learn about a manifold of perspectives and experiences.</MI1> <SI1>If people continuously try to keep contact with similar friends, they just do limited activities or experiences because they may have same habits, study same fields or even like same foods. <TR>On the contrast</TR>, if they often meet diverse people, they can have greater opportunities to do something different from things you would do because each person have dissimilar pastime, taste and perspective. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a university student, I joined the cheering club where many students were included.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, school is the place making students prepared and ready to go their job and role required by society.</MI1> <SI2>In spite of the importance of knowledge, the social skills are more substance factor for young generation to be well prepared, especially to those who do not have siblings so that they have no chance to be used to cooperate with other.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, it seems that the ability to give knowledge well could not make student learn about what has been given to them.</MI2> <SI2><TR>It is because</TR> without students’ intention to learn about something, they can not learn anything even cannot remember the fact that they learned a theory from yesterday. <EX>A new study shows that those who are not willing to learn about some definitions of Math do not recognize what they has been thought 2days ago. <TR>However</TR> those students who are very motivated are very good at remembering what they thought.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, governments in diverse countries, specially developed ones, offer all of the citizens opportunities to study at schools for free.</MI1> <SI1>Thanks to industrial and technological improvement, many countries consider how to improve people's living standard.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the only time I have had was with an English teacher I had when I was in college.</MI1> <SI1><EX>I took an elective to improve my English speaking skills with a native teacher.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the young students can have chances to find their potential abilities about art and music.</MI1> <SI1>There are few opportunities for them to experience painting or playing some instruments because they are usually forced to study math and science for exam that are important subjects in regard to entering the university. <TR>So</TR>, even if they have gifts for art and music, they cannot apprehend their potential.

If it had not been for the art class, he could not have noticed his art talent.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, the students are able to use the art and music knowledge in many diverse purposes.</MI2> <SI2>Art and music are closely or even slightly related to other fields such as math, science or history. <TR>Thus</TR>, when they study other subjects or prepare the important tests, the information of art and music can be considerably made use of. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, Western history is greatly in relation to the art history such as Renaissance, and the level of tone is explained by physics concept, wave theory. <TR>Moreover</TR>, if the students know the stories of art and music more, they can enjoy and have a better time when going to the art exhibitions or music concert.</EX> <EX><TR>In my case</TR>, the art class in high school was really helpful when I went on a trip in Italy and appreciated works of art in Vatican museum because I could learn about art of Italy at that time. <TR>In this regard</TR>, a large amount of knowledge is utilized in many different ways.</EX></SI2></BO2>

In this situation some parents don’t think seriously about their responsibility. This can more easily trigger divorce when married couples are in trouble especially if they don’t have children divorce can be though unimportant matter.

Some people might say that today’s technology has made children less motivated. Many technologies such as the internet, smartphones and computers have divested children’s opportunity to think what they can improve. <TS><TR>My view</TR>, <TR>however</TR>, is that technology can be a powerful source of creativivity. <TR>This is largely because</TR> technology provides children with a variety of sensory expression. <TR>Moreover</TR>, a lot of technologies help kids to communicate with someone who live in other world. This essay will explore the importance of technology.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>Technology has changed in terms of its expression way.</MI1> <SI1><EX>In the old days, people could get the information in limited forms like book or word of mouth. <TR>However</TR>, people these days can take care of lots of things on the move with many different kinds of modern technology.</EX> One of the biggest changes is that all modern technologies use some kind of expression methods, which makes people more creative. Computer monitor shows tons of information by visualization. A lot of audio devices give people countless materials in the form of sound. Children can now put such information together and transform them easily. <EX>According to a study conducted by a team of researchers in Sociology at Tokyo Universities, children seem to learn better when they deal with sensory learning methods rather than only book.</EX> <TR>As the study shows</TR>, developed technology has a profound relationship with children these days.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, as far as social network is concerned, technology makes it possible for children to share their academic idea with many other kids.</MI2> <SI2>They are able to make a project group with children who live on the other side of the world. It would be a good opportunity that they can share their own idea for developing, with they could not have dreamed of doing hundreds of years ago. <EX><TR>From my personal experience</TR>, I recently had to finish a research about western culture although I don’t usually meet any foreign friend. There are certainly difficulties unless I only want to use books imposing the limited amount of information. I thought of dropping the research, but I did not. I decided to stick with it. I eventually found it useful to use the internet to contact with a foreign people. I have been able to a lot of friends by connecting to chat-sites and received many culture stories. <TR>As a result</TR>, I finished first grade in the research. Had it not been for their help, I would not have completed my work.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>More than anything else</TR>, serious economic issues are caused by environmental disasters.</MI1> <SI1>Giving economic development the government’s priority may have some advantages. <TR>However</TR>, let me give you an example to prove why it is more necessary for government to give the natural environment a priority. <EX>Global warming is one of the greatest challenges presented to mankind. The cause of global warming has been strongly linked with automobiles and power plants. The automobile emissions are CO2, which is detrimental to the environment. The CO2 emitted has been shown to cause global warming. The resultant climate change has proved  detrimental to humanity. Excessive snowfalls, flooding, wildfires and the melting of icebergs are because of climate change. These natural disasters not only cause detrimental economic issues but subsequent health risks. <TR>As a result</TR>, countries are working hard to ensure they are eco-friendly. Public transport and bicycles are gaining in popularity. A great deal of money is invested in renewable energy sources. <TR>This is because</TR> everybody knows that investing in the environment  eventually saves economy. <TR>This shows that</TR> it is better for the government to give priority to the natural environment.</EX></SI1></BO1>
        
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, better environment are preferred by people.</MI2> <SI2>Government may help a bit more wealthy by giving priority to economic development. <EX><TR>However</TR>, my personal experience shows that the government needs to give a priority to the natural environment. A few years ago, my friend’s grand father living near power plants were sick due to air pollution in the area. After that, the grandfather moved to the rural area which have a great natural environment and now he is very satisfied with the city and getting better.
<TR>This proves that</TR> the natural environment should have a priority.</EX></SI2></BO2>
        
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, <TR>I agree that</TR> the natural environment have to be given the government’s priority over economic development for the reasons I have mentioned above. <TR>First</TR>, serious economic issues are caused by environmental disasters. <TR>Second</TR>, better environment are preferred by people.</CO>

595&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should spend their money on traveling rather than saving for the future.,::,"<IN>There is an argument over whether people should spend their money on traveling rather than saving for the future. Some people might say that saving money is really important for a rainy day. <TS><TR>My view</TR>, <TR>however</TR>, is that spending money for trip can become saving itself. <TR>This is largely because</TR> taking a trip is essential for a person. <TR>Moreover</TR>, going a vacation can provide people with a chance to expand their social network.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, traveling is worth of spending a quite amounts of money.</MI1> <SI1>This usually offers various valuable experiences involving making people being more cultural-sensitive and broading their perspectives.

<BO2><MI2><TR>What's more</TR>, shelter is very necessary to people who live in modern society.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is mainly due to the fact that</TR> people live so busily. <TR>So</TR>, they are weary of their lives by tons of works and stresses. <TR>This is why i think that</TR> going on vacation is pretty important. <EX>According to the research that conducted by the Ministry of Labor in 2010, employees who went on a trip periodically were two times more productive than co-workers who did not go on a trip. <TR>It means that</TR> leaving somewhere for a while is not only good for one's health, but also helpful for society.</EX></SI2></BO2>

597&Governments should support scientific research if it does not have any practical use,::,"<IN>Investing in scientific research that does not have any practical use may at first glance seem a waste of resources. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>I strongly believe that</TR> governments should support this so-called basic science for the following two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, basic scientific research is necessary to lay the foundation for further development of practical science and technologies. <TR>Second</TR>, the advancement in basic scientific studies can contribute to the favorable image of the country, brining a positive ripple effect on the overall economy.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, basic science provides building blocks for applied sciences, as can be seen from the historical evolvement of biology and neuroscience into specialized practical sciences such as medical science and pharmacology.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In turn</TR>, we can also say that the more we understand basic science, the better we can handle practical technologies because the latter is developed on the foundation of the former. <EX><TR>To take my own experience as an example</TR>, as a physical therapist I have treated many patients suffering from central nerve system diseases including stokes, brain tumors, and spinal cord injuries. <TR>However</TR>, the treatment methods were only focused on dealing with the superficial symptoms and I always felt that something was missing. When I studied the underlying basic science such as biology and neuroscience, I could better understand the disorders, identify the deeper root of the problems, and more effectively treat my patients.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, basic science is indispensible to the development of advanced technologies and they can supplement each other.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, basic science can play a significant role in the evaluation of the national image, which has a positive ripple effect on the whole economy.</MI2> <SI2>In this world where the nations themselves are branded and evaluated, all nations are striving to enhance their brands and the level of basic science by no doubt is one of the most influential factors that affect the images and brand values of the nations. This phenomenon can be explained by the tendency that once a nation obtains a favorable image, people from other nations are more apt to speak and think in favor of the said nation in overall, whether it be physical products it manufactures and exports, intellectual properties it possesses and licenses, its famous tourism spots, or even its culture and history. <TR>Consequently</TR> the nations with more positive images and higher brand values will enjoy higher chances of increased exports and more number of international tourist inflows. <TR>In short</TR>, the benefits of having a better national image and brand are easily transferrable to various sectors of the whole economy, and the level of basic science plays a crucial role for such image.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, <TR>I strongly believe</TR> the governments should invest in the research of basic sciences. <TR>This is because</TR> basic science will pave the way for further developing practical technologies while providing a way to better understand and apply them, and will bring a good image to the nation as well as potential economical benefits.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"This student's vocabulary and grammar are both excellent, with very few mistakes and a lot of good, strong words used.

598&The best way for a teacher to make their students to be interested in a subject is to explain how the subject helps them outside the school.,::,"<IN>Some people think that one of the most effective ways to attract students to be interested in a subject is by explaining how it benefits outside the school environment. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>I personally think that</TR> this approach to the students can negatively affect the overall achievement in education. <TR>This is due to the fact that</TR> adding additional concept into student’s present academic curriculum can impose pressure on the amount of area that the student must cover. <TR>Additionally</TR>, the increased workload that the student must balance among other subjects can increase student’s stress level, which may eventually cause illness related to health problems. <TR>Finally</TR>, such method of education has yet been proven be effective on every students. In other words it can also affect some students in opposite way resulting loss of interest on subject.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, explaining someone regarding any sort of a topic requires time and effort in order to successfully convey the idea.</MI1> <SI1><TR>This implies that</TR> in most cases, one cannot simply expect the other to understand the subject without paying attention to the person that is trying to explain. <TR>What this means is that</TR> the students must put extra effort and time in manifesting a new concept introduced by the teacher. The problem is that students in modern days are reluctant to learn several other subjects at the same time since the society has continued to impose multiple subjects to students in order to reach a higher education. <TR>Thus</TR> every additional concept that is being introduced to the student can induce even greater pressure on the existing curriculum, which may degrade their overall academic performance. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, there was a study conducted by Seoul University in 1989 on two groups of students in examining their performance in their learning capacity. Group A were given multiple tasks at once for completing the test within certain period. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, Group B got introduced to same tasks but in a separated format that the students could work on in sequence without being interfered to another task. <TR>The study had shown that</TR> those in Group B were achieving a higher academic standing than those in Group A. <TR>This implies that</TR> the amount of workload imposed on a student has clear relation to the ability of accomplishing several tasks much efficiently.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI1><TR>In addition</TR>, teachers’ imposition of new subject on students in gaining their interest can also cause several health-relegated problems.</MI2> <SI2><TR>This is attributed to the fact that</TR> by increasing more concepts into the table for the students to be engaged in more subjects, there is also a chance that one could end up losing focus and get bored because the topic is irrelevant to them especially at their age for example. In crease in stress level is well known factor for causing a failure of immune system. Scientists who perform experimental studies on mice have proved this. <EX>According to a research conducted by the College of Medical Science in United States, stress level which stimulated by constant electric shock on mice reduces their lifespan by twenty percent compare to regular mice that never experiences any stress. The scientists were able to illustrate the same form of phenomenon on a human being who suffered from a period stress problem. <TR>This indicates that</TR> constant input of stress on any living organism has chance of causing illness along with several health problems including diseases especially due to weakening of immune system triggered by high stress level.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>In regards to the teacher’s capability of influencing the students in explaining such subject for their future use is rather controversial because this method of education has yet been proven to work properly.</MI3> <SI3>The world is becoming more diverse, <TR>in fact</TR>, there are so much potential that today’s conception may not be the same as what we conceive tomorrow. One cannot be so sure to predict the outcome of such incident without leaving any misconception. <TR>This means that</TR> the teacher’s imposition may actually be misleading the students in wrong direction. <TR>Therefore</TR>, unless the teacher can come up with a generally accepted application that has been testified and proven to support its creditability, such assumption should not be made prior to implicating the idea on students for obtaining their interest.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In brief</TR>, although in some aspects, helping the students for gaining more interest on a subject by introducing a new topic can be somewhat convincing to a certain degree, it’s disadvantages far outweighs the possibility of such concept being successful to all students. <TR>Besides</TR>, teachers must understand that one cannot simply gain ones interest by helping someone to realize how it can be beneficial to them in future. <TR>Therefore</TR> this form of approach should not be made on students that it might also cause the opposite affect resulting in even worst situations rather than gaining the interest.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"The thesis statement of this essay is strong, giving enough detail to pull the reader in but not enough to give away the whole argument.

599&whether it is better to take the most difficult and challenging classes in college or at university even if it means that you probably will not get top grades in them.,::,"<IN>When I was a freshman in the college, one of my seniors recommended that I should take the most challenging class from the beginning, as it would help me to advance a lot in that field. So I followed his advice, which was a totally mistake. <TS>I disagree with the argument that students have to take the most difficult class in the college, and <TR>I firmly believe that</TR> it is better to take the class step by step based on one's own level. My opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, we can learn more and better by taking an easier class at first, then going on an more difficult one.</MI1> <SI1><TR>That means</TR>, following the classes step by step helps us to learn more and better at the lecture and study materials. Learning something is not the one that can be obtained at once. <TR>That is</TR>, as higher level of class assumes that student who takes that course know basic knowledge in this field, the professor usually omits many fundamental information at the lecture. <TR>Hence</TR>, if we are not familiar with basic concept or theory, it is no exaggeration that we cannot take the high level course at all. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I majored in economics and freshmen usually took the 'principle of economics 1' at the first semester. <TR>However</TR>, my mentor advised me to take the higher level class, the 'microeconomics.' I followed his advice but it was a disaster. My senior just said from his point of view, failing to consider my knowledge level.</EX> <TR>Furthermore</TR>, we tend to give up when we face the class which are too burden to follow. <EX>As I could not understand the lecture and it was impossible for me to submit the assignment and take the class, I dropped the class after all, and I had to take the basic course at the next semester.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, having a good score in the class and getting good grades are one of the most important factors to get a good job in the real life.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it another way</TR>, from the realistic point of view, taking easier classes strategically may have more possibility to give us a good reward in the near future. <TR>Of course</TR>, there is an opposition that grades are not the ultimate goals in the university life, and learning many knowledge from the class is more important. <TR>However</TR>, I think differently that not all of the students are to become professor or researcher. <TR>In addition</TR>, taking easier class and understanding basic principle of that field help us more to get a good job and adapt our learning to the real work. <EX>According to a study conducted by a well-known professor in Princeton University, 78% of the students surveyed who took the easier class was more likely to get a secure job with a decent paying. <TR>What was interesting was that</TR> those students were able to apply their learning to the real work job better, such as basic computer skills to make the power point presentation, which did not require high level of computer knowledge.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All things considered</TR>, <TR>I think that</TR> it is better not to take the most challenging class in the college, for students can fall into the risk of not understanding their class and not acquiring a good job. <TR>Therefore</TR>, we should be careful when taking the class, whether its level is fit to my level.</CO>",::,5,::,2,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,"This student does make some grammatical errors, but they're rather minor.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, smoking in hermetic places such as office building or some other places might cause second hand smokers.</MI1> <SI1><EX>According to Florida University, 40% of people, who house lung cancer, are second hand smokers due to the fact that they always were with smokers. <TR>Hence</TR>, second hand smokers can obtain sudden fatal diseases even if they have never smoked before.</EX> <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my friend, Joe acquired lung cancer thanks to his colleague whose name is John. He had a great deal time being with John. <TR>Unfortunately</TR>, he always smoked next to Joe. Joe inevitably breathed smoking smog hence he endeavored to dissuade his quitting smoking. Joe is in the hospital and John promised not to smoke anymore.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, smoking in public places can grant bad feelings to every single individual.</MI2> <SI2>When individuals breathe smog, they naturally grimace and try to avoid it. <EX>According to Phil University, Individuals actually do not care whether smokers smoke or not. <TR>However</TR>, individuals extremely detest seeing someone who smokes in certain public areas since almost all of the people are easily distracted by smoking smog and every single person has a right to exploit public areas without smog.</EX> <EX><TR>As an illustration</TR>, I was once accused of smoking at the park. I did not comprehend why I was vilified at that time. <TR>In retrospect</TR>, I was deserved to be blamed since I gave innocent citizens bad feelings. <TR>As a result</TR>, I endeavor not to smoke in public areas thanks to what happened to me.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, even though some people allege that people are allowed to smoke in the public areas or office building, I am strongly and firmly against them due to these two reasons which are mentioned in my essay.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, endless greed that influences people to want more and more is one of the many reasons why they tend to do this once they are prosperous and wealthy.</MI1> <SI1><TR>On top of this</TR>, they feel much easier and have less pressure with being brave and taking risks.

If you are born in a family, it is usually very difficult to change it. <TR>Therefore</TR>, whenever you need to prioritize one of your roles, one as a family member and the other as a employee, it must be your role in your family because it is your fate, not your choice.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, when people ask me this type of question, I always ask them back this question which is the purpose of making money suffering from such a big amount of stress.</MI2> <SI2>As all of the readers may know, most of the time, family is the biggest reason why people earn money. Especially the fathers work very hard to support and make their family happier. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my dad is working in Mexico. Since it is a foreign country, he gets more than twice the amount of stress he gets in Korea. <TR>However</TR>, he never complains about his work no matter how hard it is and always tries his best to be nice dad and husband to me and my mom.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3>The last reason why I do not agree with the statement is because family is definitely the one people in the entire world who truly thinks about you and understands you.</MI3> <SI3>Whenever you look tired or happy, they are the one who can comfort you and share the happiness with you and congratulate you by heart. This is why I think by being with your family you can relax and take a brief rest from the stressful competition in the society. My personal belief is that there is no one else that loves you as much as your family does.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, these are the main reasons why I believe spending time at work is less important than spending time with you family. Of course there are many people in the world who think the other way but still, they will understand how precious and valuable their families are someday. “Unconditional love” is the phrase that comes up to my mind when I think about my mother and father and they are who encourage me to do my best at work.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,"Overall, this is a very good essay.

Universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on universities.",::,"<IN>Some people might say the only importance and plan for attending colleges is to improve academic knowledge that would be helpful for getting future jobs. <TR>However</TR>, I firmly believe that the sports and leisure time is as helpful as academics and libraries for the students.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, sports play the excellent role in stirring up students to release their stress and focus on their studies more.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, some kind of leisure time like sports can further encourage students who are tired of difficult academic lectures to ease their mind a little bit. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my cousins had attended the college which had excellent sports facilities.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, sports activities let the students to get the social experiences which could be helpful for the future life of students.</MI2> <SI2>It is evident that the academics would be crucial for the future. <TR>However</TR>, by hanging out with more people and building up relationships, students would learn the thing that is more important than the paper-based knowledge. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my dad shared his experience when he was a senior in his campus about the benefits of participating sports club.

605&Do you think the ethic is necessary factor in mordern soceity? Support your answer.,::,"<IN>Many people think that ethics and moral has already become obsolete, so we do not need to consider them seriously. They argue that we would rather focus on other things such as making money and learning much knowledge than abide by ethics. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this opinion, thinking that ethics is one of the most important factors to our society.</TS> And my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, ethics is necessary to live amicable among people.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To put it another way</TR>, ethics is still an effective tool to socialize with others smoothly. As the modern society becomes more complicated and urbanization is pervasive to the modern life, we are more likely to meet many and various people in our daily life. If we do not observe the shared ethics and moral, it is certain that we will face severe conflicts among people. <TR>In this situation<TR>, ethics plays a pivotal role to bond people together and leads them to live a happy life. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, many people these days are living in the same place, like apartment buildings. Because there are many people who do not know each other even if they live closely, it is important to abide by social rules, to prevent us from having conflicts. There are various etiquettes, from being quiet in the corridor and not running on the floor, to saying hello to each other when they run into. By respecting this ethics, we can live comfortably with neighbors. This illustrates the point that ethics is not an obsolete thing which should be discarded, rather it is crucial to our life.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, ethics gives the emotion of being respected.</MI2> <SI2>This kind of emotion is really important in the modern society. According to a study conducted by a famous sociologist named Mark Krugman, the present generations have a tendency to feel lonely more than the past generations. This is because of the stylized works,  mechanization and severe competitive environments in the workplace. <TR>In this circumstance</TR>, ethics helps people to relieve their sense of isolation, by feeling respect and kindness. The study result shows that those who are treated with care called 'ethics therapy', which comprises of activity such as showing warm attitude and concerning about each other's daily routine, have shown improvement their mental and physical health. This leads them to live a life more positively and actively. <EX>I have one example. I had one old person next to my house when I was a middle school student. I used to give warm greeting to him and listen traditional fairy tales, showing honor to him. From this, I not only learnt lots of knowledge from him, but he also felt pride about himself, helping to relieve isolation. Thus it was an win-win strategy.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I firmly believe that we still need ethics and moral, as they are important to make the society a livable place. <TR>Therefore</TR>, we should consider ethics not as a thing which is unnecessary, but as a invaluable thing to be enriched by us.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"An excellent, thoughtful, elegant essay.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, <TR>Like I articulated above</TR>, Being polite is the way of living.</MI1> <SI1>If we don't be polite each other, there will be fights happening everywhere. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, When I was in train in Korea, two women started to fight over the seat and other people intervene the fight and got involved into it. <TR>Eventually</TR>, they fought really harshly. If they had been polite to each other a litter more, they would not had to fight.</EX> Then I realized how it is important to be polite. <EX><TR>To contrary</TR>, when I was taking bus the other day, A student yielded a seat to an elder.

  <BO1><MI1>Having part time jobs seems to deprive teenage students of time to study.</MI1> <SI1>The time in their teenage years is the best season to learn and cultivate the elementary knowledge which will be a cornerstone of their future study in a university or college. If they spend their time in working a part time job, they might have a bit of knowledge of life, but it will take a huge of time to follow up the study which they neglected due to the work. <TR>Thus</TR>, for the higher education, teenage students should more focus on their study rather than getting part time jobs.</SI1></BO1>

  <BO2><MI2>Some people might say that working at teenage years can help finding a vocational aptitude of students.</MI2> <SI2><TR>However</TR>, many business experts claim that working at an early age is ineffective.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, scientists cannot try to make new discoveries.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Generally</TR>, if scientists get pressure from society that complains scientists should be responsible for the negative effects of their discoveries, scientist could not make any new discoveries because of it. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I have invented a new chair that has three legs.

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, the negative effects are not the scientists’ fault.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In general<TR>, scientists make negative discoveries rather than people make the inventions to negative impacts for their purpose. <TR>For example</TR>, the nuclear was not the weapon, when it was invented.

This is because I can express my opinion and feeling clearer. Also the response will be immediate and favorable.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, complaining in person is a better way to express my opinion and feeling than complaining in writing.</MI1> <SI1>There are a number of ways that I can clearly express my opinion. <TR>For example</TR>, if my product has a problem, then I can take the product to the store and show to the staff. <TR>In this way</TR>, I do not have to elaborate further; a picture is worth than a thousand words. <TR>In some cases</TR>, it is hard to pin-point a problem of a certain product, especially electronic devices. People have hard time on describing the problem as they are not specialists. <TR>As a result</TR>, there is a big chance that people’s complains may end up ignored. <TR>In addition</TR>, face to face communication is a better way to deliver my dissatisfaction of a product or service. <TR>To be specific</TR>, I can use my different tones, higher loudness of voice and body language to fully express my feeling. <TR>However</TR>, writing only shows plain words. <TR>Consequently</TR>, a writing of complain cannot show how serious my problem is or how dissatisfied I am. This shows that complaining in person is better at expressing my opinion and feeling than in writing.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, by complaining in person I will have immediate and favorable response.</MI2> <SI2>What I mean is that since the complaining process is done in face to face communication, I will get immediate apology, feedback and solution. <TR>For instance<TR>, if my brand-new shirts had some problems, then I can bring the shirts to the store and complain about the shirts. The store manager will immediately make a refund or compensation on the spot. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, if I complain in writing, then it takes several days for me to receive a reply. <TR>What’s worse</TR>, some stores do not provide favorable solutions.

Even though parents’ interest for educational courses is helpful for children’s academic achievements, the excessive interest will limit the free of students, and become a financial burden in home. <TR>For example</TR>, in Korea, higher education tends to open only to good students. <TR>Thus</TR>, students should attend private academies after school without their willingness. According to a statistics, Korean parents spend 60 percentage of their incomes for attending private academies and language training abroad. Before to initiate the limitation, the expected problems should be considered.</SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, not all good students make better academic results in higher education.</MI2> <SI2>Higher education offers classes focused on one field. <TR>In contrast</TR>, good students have good scores in overall educational courses.

615&people learn more by watching television than by reading books.,::,"<IN>Some people believe that reading books is better method to learn something than watching television. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR> in my opinion</TR>, watching television can be much more effective for learning because it is attractive and convenient.</TS></IN>
      
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people can be more attracted by television than by books.</MI1> <SI1>This is because television provides moving material which attracts our mind and makes our eyes fixed on the screen. <EX><TR>To be specific</TR>, one day 4-year-old my cousin tried to learn numbers. So he opened big book and saw pictures and numbers on it. <TR>However</TR>, since it was not able to keep his attention, so he lost his interest in it after 5 minutes. So my aunt put a TV education program for him. After 30 minutes later, he was still sitting on the sofa, staring characters on the screen. After the program, he got to know how to count from 1 to 10.</EX><SI1></BO1>
    
<BO2><MI2><TR>On the top of that</TR>, watching television to learn something is much convenient than searching materials in the book.</MI2> <SI2>This is because you do not need to move ourselves much to change channels, while it takes lots of energy to turn the page over, sit in front of the desk to read, and find right materials in books. So I think you can learn something no matter how you are tired if television remains on. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was young, my mother urged me to read some books to learn english for the test on next day. <TR>However</TR>, I was too tired to sit and read books with all my concentration after the hectic school life. Mother saw me and put the TV english program which was my favorite. So I laid down on the sofa, watched program and learned materials. On the next day, I got the great grade. If I had had to read books instead of watching television, I could not have gotten good grade on the test because I had not been able to concentrate on studies.</EX></SI2></BO2>
    
<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, convenience and attractiveness are the merits that television has compared to book in terms of learning something. And <TR>for these reasons</TR>, I strongly believe that people can learn more by watching television rather than reading books.</CO>

616&Children should spend most of their time studying and playing rather than helping their family with household chores such as cleaning.,::,"<IN>Some say that studying and playing are the most imortant priorities for children. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR> in my opinion</TR>, they should help their family by doing household chores. This is not only because these things help them to learn about the sense of reponsibility that they should have as a member of the family, but also because they can understand their parents’ real effort.</TS></IN>

  <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> they can build up their sense of responsibility by sharing their parents’ burdensome house works.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, the best way to improve this sense is to help household chores and take care of their brothers each other. By improving the sense of responsibility, they can contribute to not only their family but also communities they should take part in.  A recent research  released by the Ministry of Education in Korea investgated the relationship between the role of parents and the sense of responsibility of children. The research shows that parents who ask their children to help house works make them get a good sense of responsibility. Besides, the more sense of responsibility they have, the better recognized they are as a member of communities.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, they can more understand their parents by doing ardous house works together.</MI2> <SI2>They can realize how hard a variety of householding chores are, and spend large amount of time with their parents doing things such as washing dishes, cleaning their rooms, and cutting the grass. It can be a useful time for them to make a good relationship with their parents. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a middle school student, I often helped my parents take care of a large number of trees in our farm. It was really hard for me to look after trees becase there were a variety of works to do such as cutting useless branches, fertilizing a field, and pulling weeds. When I look back at that time, I really appreciate the value of my parents even though the work was burdensome.</EX></SI2></BO2>

  <CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, helping their family with householding chores allows children to get a better sense of responsibility which make them to be recognized by others as well as they can understand their parents more deeply by sharing their housework. <TR>In this regard</TR>, I disagree with the statement that children should spend their time only studying and playing.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,Another very good essay!

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, large companies are more stable.</MI1> <SI1>Although we do not work only for money, we should admit that money is one of the top priorities that we work for.

627&The ability to cooperate with others is more important today than in the past.,::,"<IN>It is evident that in our society how we cooperate with others has a tremendous importance in our lives. Some people think that it is better to work alone these days, while others do not. <TS>I <TR>however</TR>, believe that people should cooperate with others than in the past. There are several reasons that I could discuss to support my argument so I will my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic: the concepts of success and relationships.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that it is much easier for people to become successful professionals.</MI1> </SI1>Commonly in society, nowadays companies tend to prefer people who have experience in group projects. If people cooperate with coworkers, they will be able to obtain the experience which is an essential element to succeed in the workplace. <EX>A really good example can be seen in Steve Jobs. I read online that Jobs, the CEO of Apple Company, transformed his company into one of the most profitable information technology enterprises in the world because he was able to work together with their workers. In one of his interviews he said that he worked with many Asian countries people such as Japan. He was able to see many opinions which he could not think. This helped Jobs make a better design when he created the iPhone: the most successful smartphone ever made. This example clearly shows that working with others is more important these days than in the past.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, another reason for my thinking this way is that relationships are more important in nowadays.</MI2> <SI2>So people should have a better social life. People nowadays need more opportunities to socialize but expanding social networks in becoming increasingly difficult due to various changes in culture and individualism. <TR>Thus</TR>, it can be said that cooperating with others is more important in today social life. A recent article I read on the Korean Daily revealed some interesting findings. According to the article, a surprising number of foreigner claimed that they are lonely. One executive from Samsung Company mentioned that there are a lot of foreigner workers, so they have some cultural troubles with other co-workers. This applies to my life as well. <EX>Just few years ago, I did not have any foreign friends who lived in my country, but now I have a chance to meet new friends. If I cannot join with others, I would have been able to meet many more friends.</EX> As this outcome, shows nowadays the ability to cooperate with others is extremely important than long ago.</SI2></BO2>",::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,This is a very well-written essay.

628&Students are influenced more by their friends than by their teachers.,::,"<IN>Many people think that students are heavily influenced by their teachers, as they learn many things from teachers. So we sometimes neglect the existence of their friends, who actually have more influential power. <TS>I think that students are influenced more by their friends than by their teachers, and my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, students have more time to share with their friends than teachers.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To put it another way</TR>, having more time with friends in daily life means they are more likely to be influenced by each other. Whether they are in classroom or after school, they are almost surrounded by their friends all the time. Thus the possibility of being influenced by his or her friends is high. One research illustrates this argument clearly. According to the study, people have a tendency to mimic their thinking and behavior with those who share much time. The student surveyed were asked to answer the questions, such as &quotWho is the most important person in your daily life?&quot, &quotAre you inclined to follow your peer's thinking and behavior?&quot, &quotWhat is the reason that you mimic your thinking and behavior?&quot Around 87% of the students answered that they were highly influenced by their friends, and sharing much time with them was the most important reason why they followed their friends. The result reflects that there really exists 'peer pressure', which means that the youth are influenced by their friends.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, students can share their hobby with their friends easily than with their students.</MI2> <SI2>As the hobby is one of the main factors to share time and common interest, those who share hobby are more likely to become similar each other. There is a gap between students and teachers, in terms of age, physical ability, living environment, etc. That is, the generation gap makes students to share their hobby with teachers difficult. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I really like playing basketball with people, so I usually make up the team to enjoy my hobby. As the playing is generally tough and physically challenging, I cannot enjoy playing basketball with my homeroom teacher, who are old and do not like sports activities, even if she is a really good person. Because of this difference, I do not have many things to share with when I meet her, except study. <TR>Naturally</TR>, I become more influenced by my friends who enjoy playing basketball and have more common things to share.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all</TR>, if I closely look into the young students' daily life, I can conclude that students are more influenced by their friends than teachers, because of sharing more time and hobby. <TR>Hence</TR>, I can say this as 'birds of a feather flock together.'</CO>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, televisions are detrimental when it comes to education, because they cause distraction.</MI1> <SI1>To learn, people must concentrate on the materials that they study. But, while watching a tv, it is very hard to focus on boring lectures. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was 15 years old, I decided to watch CNN, the American news, to study English. <TR>However</TR>, whenever I felt boring, I got distracted and watched other entertainments since changing channels was too easy. <TR>In contrast</TR>, when I determined to learn English by reading English novels, it was much easier to concentrate on. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I firmly believe that books are more educational and tubes are more for entertainment purpose.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, people learn more by reading since almost every book is educational.</MI2> <SI2>Textbooks, novels, essays, practice books...even cartoons are sometimes very educational. <TR>However</TR>, most tv programs are not.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, we spend more time with our friends, not our teachers.</MI1> <SI1>With friends we share every stories and secrets. <TR>Therefore</TR>, a friend understands you more than a teacher. Humans are inclined to rely on someone who they believe understand them more. So when it comes to difficult situation and problems, we are likely to look for a friend's help, not tutor’s. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when my mom and I fought, my heart was broken. When my teacher heard about the story, she only criticized me since she only viewed the situation in adult's view. <TR>However</TR>, my friend Soyeon comprehended how I feel and gave me real consolation. <TR>Moreover</TR>, she also gave me a good resolution to end up the cold situation because she also had had similar experience with her mother.

The compelling logic behind this is that using money on vacation will give an opportunity to travel and broaden one’s perspective.</TS></IN>

    <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, vacation enables people to get a chance to travel.</MI1> <SI1>An important reason is that an opportunity to travel is very restricted because of the insufficient time and not enough good health. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, we can save money wherever whenever we want. <TR>Therefore</TR>, it is better to spend money on vacation to travel as possible as we can. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, last summer, our family engaged to travel abroad. <TR>However</TR>, only my mother and I had a happy time on traveling. The reason was that my father was busily occupied with his own chores at his company ranging from searching other companies’ strategy of marketing to having presentation in front of the company’s president. <TR>Therefore</TR>, he could no hang out with us and envied us very much. <TR>In this respect</TR>, spending money on vacation provides people with an enjoyable time.</EX></SI1></BO1>

    <BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, spending money on vacation for traveling will widen one’s outlook.</MI2> <SI2>This is largely because we can meet many people with different races, cultures, and even religious by traveling.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, it is important for studying to make silent atmosphere because children are susceptible to surroundings.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In detail</TR>, TV makes noise to nearby the children. I have personally experienced this on many occasions, but the most notable example is as follows: <EX>I was studying for final exam when I was in high school. <TR>At that time</TR>, my parents were watching the TV in the living room. I could not focus on my studying because laughing sound from my parents and TV volume bothered me to concentrate severely. <TR>Thus</TR>, I should have to go to the library and this situation created more efficient atmosphere to study. <TR>As a result</TR>, this lends itself to the following logic: focusing on the studying is vulnerable from surroundings where people are. <TR>In this sense</TR>, it is evident that parents should reduce their time in watching the TV for their children to study hard.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, children could not pay attention to their study because there are a lot of TV programs which tempt young people.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In particular</TR>, children are drawn by the TV which has various comedy programs.

"634&Today, it is easier to become an educated person than in the past.",::,"<IN>Opinions are divided as to whether it is easier to become an educated person nowadays than past. <TS>I strongly agree that today, becoming educated is much easier for following two reasons. <TR>First</TR>, the availability of Internet let ones easily get information about what they want to learn. <TR>Second</TR>, competitive and busy social environment makes people become more equipped with knowledge on what they need.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, <TR>nowadays</TR>, access to the Internet is so high that ones can easily collect their information when they need it.</MI1> <SI1>Let me show an example to prove why person can become educated easily todays. These days many students can easily learn what they want from the websites, which offer a variety of courses compared to fixed traditional curriculums in convention school. Taking classes online is so cheap and convenient that people can be educated readily. Online users have another obvious advantage in that there is an active interaction and peer evaluation available. It was unimaginable in the past that regardless the time of day and place, people could upload and download their knowledge with others from various countries. <TR>Therefore</TR>, modern people find it easier to get a chance to become specialized and professionalized than before.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, people tend to develop themselves to be more competitive nowadays.</MI2> <SI2>This is because getting into elite university or large and famous company is getting become more and more intensive. <TR>Naturally</TR>, many students keep a busy schedule preparing for their future career even in their freshman year at college. It is not uncommon for student to take double majors to equip themselves with various knowledge and information.

635&First impressions tell a lot about people.,::,"<IN>There are a lot of controversies over whether first impressions tell a lot about people or not. Some people agree with the saying, &quotDo not judge the book by its cover&quot. <TS><TR>However</TR> I think first impressions have a great effect on people's thinking since people still judge a person based on his or her look and a person's look shows his or her personality.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people have more tendency to make an important decision by just looking at others' appearances.</MI1> <SI1>When people first meet with other people, they try to know each other by their looks and decide to do something. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I read once the article about the importance of first impression. It said that people are more likely to judge others based on their looks in an important place such as blind date or meeting for the trade. They make up thier minds to go on a date or to do a business with their opponents by just looking at them since they don't have enough time and their looks are the only source. In this sense people consider first impressions as an important matter when deciding something.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, a person's appearance reveals who he or she is.</MI2> <SI2>This is because even if people don't want to, their looks itself tell what kinds of personality they have.</EX> <TR>For instance</TR>, when one of the interviewers who has interviewd candidates many times for the company was invited to give a lecture to students, I attended and learned some skills to succeed interview. Interview usally lasts only 30 minutes or an hour so that I thought it looked too short to know about one person. <TR>However</TR>, he told us taht it did not take long to judge a candidate since thier faces show if they are optimistic and promising or not.

    <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, traditional buildings improve the economic situation of a nation.</MI2> <SI2>This is largely because the benefit of historic building’s protection is related to the economy. <TR>In other words</TR>, the well-preserved historic buildings can develop tourism industry as attraction millions of foreign visitors and provide historical information with beautiful scenery. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, Rome, the capital city of Italy, known for a great number of historic buildings, benefits from tourism. This is because they draw numerous foreign visitors wanting to enjoy the grand scale of historic buildings. <TR>Therefore</TR>, many businesses such as restaurants, snack shops, and souvenir stores will have more and more customers. <TR>What is more</TR>, a number of jobs related to the historic buildings will be created.</EX> <TR>Thus</TR> this example proves that the well-preserved historic buildings will have economic benefits.</SI2></BO2>

639&Government should focus more on preserving nature and less on the economic development.,::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether government should focus more on preserving nature and less on the economic development. The answer to this question can vary greatly, depending on the individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR>, I agree with the statement.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, our environment is severely polluted by people.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In detail</TR>, releasing of CO2 from the economic development makes greenhouse effect to the earth. According to a report recently released in 2012 by the Seoul National University, discharging CO2 is main problem of environmental contamination. The study found that the ozone layer had decreased compare to the past 10 years. Although the economic development was the best choice of government in the past, nature problem is more important than that in nowadays. <TR>As a result</TR>, this leads to the following logic: government had made unbalanced development, which had led critical pollution to the nature. <TR>In this sense</TR>, it is evident that the present is the period that we have to adjust the environmental pollution.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, the nature is indispensable part to the human being.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In particular</TR>, the nature is more close to people than economy. I have experienced this on many occasions, but the most notable example is as follows: I learned about the environment when I was in high school. The teacher said that the nature is the most near existence to human. <TR>Also</TR>, he taught to student that if the nature has destroyed by people, it will be a biggest sin to our son or daughter. As with teacher said, preserving nature is very important than other developments. <TR>Therefore</TR>, this lends itself to the following logic: the nature which is the part of people’s beginning and ending together must be preserved by people. <TR>In this respect</TR>, it is apparent that protecting the nature should be the first step than the economic development.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. <TR>Once again</TR>, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales above are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"A very good essay!

<BO1><MI1>The First reason is that student’s learning ability will decrease if they stop entering university.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In general</TR>, students who attended high school until a recent day usually have a high-level learning ability because they studied very hard. <TR>However</TR>, the capacity of study will rapidly drop if they rest from studying. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my friend, Joseb, entered a university after working part-time job at a restaurant for one year.

<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason is that students can travel or work while attending university.</MI2> <SI2>In common, university students usually go on a trip or get a part-time job during summer or winter vacation seasons. And then, they broden their outlook while traveling new city or country and earn the money fairly during working at diverse part-time jobs. A study at the University of North Carolina revealed that more than eighty percent of students who are attending the university are busy traveling around another city or working a part-time job rather than studying their major. As shown this above, students do not need to take a year off due to trip or working.</SI2></BO2>

653&A teacher's ability to relate well to students is more important than his or her ability to impart knowledge.,::,"<IN>In the fast-paced society, the society require a variety of capabilities to students before to go into the society.

<BO1> <MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teachers could provide their students with the best education by understanding them.</MI1> <SI1>As understanding based on knowledge, teachers who are relate well to students will know about their student's pros and cons. <TR>Therefore</TR>, the teachers could provide the different education depending on their students' characteristics. With the changed education, students will cover their disadvantages and strengthen their advantages. <EX>In the field of science, Albert Einstein explicitly shows the importance of ability to relate well to students. <TR>At the first</TR>, Einstein went into the school and his teachers went to an extra mile to impart knowledge regardless of his interest. <TR>However</TR>, Einstein could not stand the forced education. <TR>Then</TR>, Einstein began the home-schooling with his mother who comprehended his interest and ability. The education with the comprehension made an incredible result that he opened new era in the physics.</EX> As you can see this compelling example, teachers who understand their students can release the students' potentialities.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, teachers who are relate well to students could help students' mental growth.</MI2> <SI2>Students need not only broaden knowledge but also mental maturation in school. Without comprehension about their students, the students will not open their mind. If teachers are relate to their students, they can advice about students' worries. It will lead students' mental growth.  <EX>Let's take Helen Keller as an example. Keller was troubled to adjust a school because the teachers did not care about the difficulty of Keller. <TR>However</TR>, Sullivan made an effort to share her worries before to teach. The understanding inspired her to continue learning regardless of her physical difficulties. <TR>As a result</TR>, she could matriculate to the Harvard University. If Sullivan take an emphasis on imparting knowledge, Keller may be not courage to overcome her difficulty.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, the education contains more things than teaching scholar knowledge to students.</SI2></BO2>

 <CO><TR>Hence</TR>, we can conclude that a teacher's ability to relate well to students is more important than his or her ability to impart merely knowledge. <TR>Above all</TR>, comprehension to their students gives the best way to teach depending on their capabilities. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, we can expect mental growth of students by sharing experience with the students.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"A really excellent essay!

First is to enjoy money after earning, while the other way is to save money after they earn it. I believe there are many people who prefer the former. <TS><TR>However</TR>, i strongly believe that the latter way is a better option.</TS> There are many supportive reasons which i am going to enumerate from now on.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost,</TR> if we just enjoy spending money, there will be no money for the future when incidents happens.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR> even if one's job is very stable, once global economical depression happens, he might get fired.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, we could obtain a great deal of funds and profits by showing foreigners historic buildings.</MI1> <SI1>The more historic buildings exist, the more foreigners visit our country and endeavor to see our inexpensive legacy. <TR>Additionally</TR>, we naturally earn a great deal of profits from them.

This is because it can give them skewed concept about products and parents aren't capable to monitor all the situations.</TS></IN>
   
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, television advertising can affect concept of things which children have.</MI1> <SI1>This is because children usually have less experience about the world and are likely to believe what TV says to them without skeptical thought. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, a cousin of mine saw the cereal advertisement which argued that it would give power like a tiger if anyone has it for breakfast. He was fascinated by those words, expecting &quottiger power&quot. From the following day, he refused to have a proper meal, instead, wanted to have cereal as his meal.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people are available to have various experience and to learn more via traveling and vacation.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, traveling and vacation helps people to have better chance to be successed because they can meet many people and see broad view. <TR>For instance</TR>, according to a study done by the New York times, it revealed that there was a relationship between the times of traveling and vacation and chance to have better life. The study indicated that if people have more traveling and vacation, they had 70% higher opportunity to be succeed comparing people who did not have many traveling and vacation.

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, traveling and vacation are more fun.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To be specific</TR>, people are happy and can get rid of stress while they are traveling.

The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on the individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR>, I disagree with the statement. First, personal experience has more positive effect on understanding a country. Second, through museams people just learn about a history of the country.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, real experience plays crucial role in learning about a country.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the reason that according to a reseach conducted by the National University of Korean, indirect experience such as visiting museams are tended to easily forget compared to direct experience in person. <EX>To take my self for instance, I visited the United Kingdom on last summer. That time I went to numerous museams and galleries to understand The nation. <TR>However</TR>, when I jung around with british friends in the pub and talked to them I could comprehended more about the state. This means that instead of visiting museams, people are more able to understand about a countury by associating with the local people.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In additon</TR>, people can just know a nation's history through museams.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In fact</TR>, the atmosphere of a countury is more important to understand a nation. According to one report by the Department of Education in Korea, through the current atmosphere of a single country, people can anticipate the nation's life and understand their culture.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, it is not that imperative to visiting museums to understand a country.

663&A teacher's ability to relate well with students is more important than the ability to give knowledge.,::,"<IN>As the education envirenment is changing each year, the barrier between teacher and students is disappearing and they are more closer than they were in the past. <TS>Some people state that it is important for a teacher to relate well with students. <TR>However</TR> I do not think it is good since it makes students harder to concentrate on studying and it is not an important ability as a teacher.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teacher who gets along well with students does not help students to study hard.</MI1> <SI1>This is because if teacher is the one who put relating well with students as the first thing and tries to be close to them, it will spoil the environment in the class when studying. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was in high school, one of my teachers really likes to have a good relationship with my classmates. <TR>Therefore</TR> she always talks gossip, gives jokes and plays with us. It was fun. <TR>However</TR> the problem is that it is difficult for her to make students focus on lesson back after having fun times. After all most of the students who wanted to study hard complained about her and could not think her as a good teacher.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, giving knowledge to students is more important ability for teacher than playing with students.</MI2> <SI2>This is because the purpose of establishing school and hiring teachers is to help students to get knowledge from teachers and become better and intelligent people. A recent poll conducted in the middle shool best illustrates this point. The poll asked students like this; What kinds of teachers do you like? The answer was they prefer the teachers who are good at teaching as the best. They said that the teacher who is funny and relate well with them seems popular but they like the teacher who takes the lecture very well by making them understand about the contents easily. That is why they like to have a teacher who has the ability to give knowledge.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I do believe that the most vital ability as a teacher is not to get along well with students but to give knowledge. This is due to the fact that the teacher who more likes to play with students does not help to create studying environment and the main role of teacher is to give students knowledge.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"An excellent essay!

665&Are Parents Best Teachers?,::,"<IN>Except some cases, most of us learnt our mother language and social rules from our parents in our childhood, and successfully internalized them. In that sense, most patents are qualified to be good teachers at least for their own children. Because those two qualities are never easy to be equipped, but our parents successfully made us learn them. <TS><TR>Therefor</TR>, I think parents are the first and the best teacher of our lives and there are several reasons why parents can be one of the best teachers for children.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, parents are the most influential people to their children.</MI1> <SI1>Children learn a lot of things from how to bow to how to read from their parents. Sometimes they imitate their parents habits consciously and unconsciously. Especially when young, children tend to follow what their parents say unconditionally, so what parents say is very powerful driver to children, which leads to good results in both academic and personal development.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2>Another important reason is that parents best know their children, so individually-customized education is possible.</MI2> <SI2>If a child prefers visual materials like pictures to text like books, his/her parents use many visual materials, such as graphs, photographs, or video clips, which leads to the best learning results for their children. Parents also teach their children with great care and affection than anyone else.</SI2></BO2>
  
<BO3><MI3><TR>Last, but not the least</TR>, parents' life itself could be a good exemplar for their children.</MI3> <SI3>Whether it is a simple life or a rich life, a honest life or a deceiving life,  it will help children decide how they should live their own lives. Some will think they will live their parents lives, and others do not. They will learn the complexity of human life and human relations through their parents' lives. It is much more vivid and realistic and influential than the lives in the books or movies. Parents can change their children's lives.</SI3></BO3>
  
<CO>All I mentioned above doesn't mean that Children no not need other professional teachers. There is not only one best teacher because there is no one who knows every answer to everything in the world. <TR>However</TR>, in the aspects of their dedication and sacrifice, their contribution as role models, and their influence on their children, there is no doubt that parents are one of best teachers in the world.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"Your essay is pretty good.

666&It is more important to keep old friends than to make new friends.,::,"<IN>Most people keep their friendship with their old friends, and, at the same time they make their new friends. Some people say that it is more important to keep old friends than to make new friends. Others have the opposite opinions. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I agree with the statement because old friends are more comfortable to be around, and very helpful when people have problems.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, for most people, their old friends are more comfortable to spend time with than new friends.</MI1> <SI1>Old friends know their friends well because they have shared many experiences together. <TR>For example</TR>, if a friend makes a mistake, his or her old friend would understand and forgive their friends easily. Old friends are still able to see that their friend is good and not judge their friends because of an error. <TR>Therefore</TR>, they can freely talk about any subject with them. then, he or she has comfort with their old friends because they know each other well.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Second of all</TR>, when people have problems his or her old friend would give their hands firstly.</MI2> <SI2>And they would tell useful advice based on knowing his or her background. New friends may be hesitant to give advice because they do not know each other well also they don’t know about his or her history. <TR>Furthermore</TR>, the advice from old friends is very practical and thoughtful. This is because they understand their friend’s past experience. Then, they can make suggestion that match their friend’s personality.

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly support that old friends are more essential than making new friends.

<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason is that young people in the past were willing to help advancing to the world.</MI2> <SI2>Let me take my experience as an example. When I took in history class, I learned about how young people help to developing the world. <TR>As I learned</TR>, people in the past often made a contribution when their country or the world was in trouble such as depression in economic. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, 30 years ago, many young people over the world helped to recovering my country when my country had a lack of financial.  This is because they have a much interest in development of the world.</EX> Through this experience, I realized that people are not willing to make a contribution to the world. Therefore, now, it is no surprise that young people don’t try to help for development of the world because they feel don’t need to know and help the world.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many people have been busy nowadays.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In detail</TR>, people will not prepare their food because a lot of people are working everyday.

I had to attend every class and do a lot of project, so I couldn’t spend time cooking for my meal. <TR>Eventually</TR>, I went to the restaurant in university for solving the meal problem.</EX> <TR>As a result</TR>, this leads to the following logic: people have lack of time for cooking in the busy life. <TR>In this sense</TR>, it is evident that people will go to the restaurant because of too much schedule.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, cooking will be replaced by abundant restaurants and instant food.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the reason that restaurants are increasing every year and instant food is developing by food technology. According to a report recently released in the Seoul National University in Korea, approximately 1500 restaurants are multiplying every year. <TR>Thus</TR>, we are exposed to the cafeteria around the home. <TR>Also</TR>, the study found that there are many high-quality instant foods. This figure is two times more than five years ago. So many salesmen enjoy the instant foods near the office. <TR>Therefore</TR>, this lends itself to the following logic: there are overflowed by the restaurants and instant foods in our surroundings. <TR>In this respect</TR>, it will be predicted that people may find the food near themselves rather than make their food.</SI2></BO2>

677&Why Go To University? ,::,"<IN>In Korea, the rate of students who go to college is over 80%. Do all those students who study in university have strong desire for learning? The answer may be no. <TR>From my experience</TR>, most of them enter university just because others do so, and, if not, they would not get good jobs. <TR>In that sense</TR>, a university diploma is merely a kind of extremely expensive certificate for jumping into a high-quality job pool.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, education in university can raise one's level of knowlege by several steps.</MI1> <SI1>The professors of university are great experts in one area and dedicate all their lives to study their specialized field. Many academic books also provide us with a great deal of information about our major, which is from our scholars in the past. It would be great opportunity to take all the knowlege compressively, which could enrich our knowlege system.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, in the viewpoint of development of society or the whole world, we need well-educated people who lead the rest of the poeple.</MI2> <SI2>Some great elites, like Edison or Newton, improved our lives a great deal. On the basis of what we learn in university we can build up our own theories to raise the quality of human life, which, in turn, would be put into practice in the form of new technology like IT or new medical for treatments of deseases.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>Last but not least</TR>, universities can be a kind of meeting place for young promising scholars.</MI3> <SI3>Instead of being stuck in a small room and one's own narrow thought, they can meet new people, freely express their opinions and discuss them with other students.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the charge for traffic congestion could improve the traffic jam in area where the traffic congestion takes place often.</MI1> <SI1>Some people say that it is not helpful to charge people for traffic jam in that area. But I strongly believe that it is better to charge money for the congestion. This is because that most people do not want to spend some money on that kind of charge. They may feel it is a waste if they spend money on them. As a result many drivers avoid that area not to charge money so that it could reduce the traffic congestion in that area. According to a recent report, by applying that regulation to some area, it could reduce the traffic problems up to 30% compared to before in Seoul Korea. Therefore, we have to carry out that regulation if we want to get helpful results.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, it absolutely could have a helpful effect on public transportations such as bus and subway.</MI2> <SI2>In Seoul city, it is very common that traffic jam take place.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, spending time alone gives us a bit of time to look back and find resoultion for stress.</MI1> <SI1> When we are alone, we can concentrate on ourselves without interruption from others.

As much as the domain grows bigger, some people worry about whether nowadays people put too much emphasis on personal appearance and fashion. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I strongly disagree with the aforementioned statement because a recent phenomenon is natural expression according to economic prosperity and our society put emphasis on the diversity.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, originally appearance and fashion are matters of interests in a human society.</MI1> <SI1>Even though it seems that people buy more clothes and cosmetics, the expenditure is the result of the economic growth. In past, those apparels and cosmetics were limited to aristocrats. They spent much money for luxury items such as jewelry and garments. In some times, they endured great inconvenience for personal appearance and vogue. <EX><TR>For example</TR>,  women wear a corset for fashion in the Middle age.</EX> <TR>Considering this point,</TR> it would be fair to compare the recent propensity of consumption for personal appearance with that of the aristocrats. <TR>Accordingly</TR>, we should understand the growth of beauty industry as the outcome of the economic growth. <TR>In this regard</TR>, nowadays people are interested in personal appearance and fashion just as much as people were.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, personal appearance and fashion are the values among a myriad of social values.</MI2> <SI2>Although some people put more weight on the appearance, others have put emphasis on other values such as the cutting-edge technology. The appearance and vogue are no longer common matters of the interest. According to the survey in the Korean National Statistical Office in 2012, only 34% of people are interested in the appearance. Compared to the result in 2005, the figure was dropped from 41% . <TR>Furthermore,</TR> people cannot have the concrete standard of the appearance. As people have their own thought, they post on their thinkings on the Internet and make their unique styles. In this trend, the standard of personal appearance and fashion made by mass media are losing their power.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>Hence</TR>, we can conclude that the recent concern about personal appearance and fashion is not severe. <TR>Above all</TR>, those kind of concerns existed in history.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, university helps students to broaden their social networks.</MI1> <SI1>Compared to highschool, students are able to meet more people with different backgrounds and interests and communicate with them in classes. Except for studying with others, students can participate in club activities. <EX>In my personal experience, I was an newspaper editor in my college.

683&Why go to university,::,"<IN>We leave in a fast-changing society and without special skills to live, the world we live wouldn’t permit us to sustain life easily. The ability doing better than other people is like to provide the good product or services to other people and get some compensation as the payback. This seems to be simple axiom. Some people agree that the university is essential process to get this knowledge earned by carefully contemplating the problems or communicating with other colleagues about it. I’d like to apply this thought to an economic major student in the university to understand it with ease.</IN>

<BO1><MI1>Going in to the business field, we need specialty of each one’s major to earn the money we need.</MI1> <SI1>Economy is difficult to understand for high school students having shallow background.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, if pupils pick up subjects as many as they can, they could be much versatile than any other person.</MI1> <SI1>Due to the fact that they could experience and learn a great many of lessons from many subjects, they could be well-informed men with broad vision. <TR>What is more</TR>, being able to different subjects is much entertaining than to study only one subject. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was freshman, I endeavored to choose a wide array of courses since I realized that undergoing many fields is extremely priceless memory for me. <TR>Hence</TR>, now, everyone praises my great deal of knowledge since I taught them what they don’t know. </EX><TR>Therefore</TR>, this example precisely shows of how taking many courses are beneficial and positive for students.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, there are a great many of opportunities to be accepted into prestigious incorporation for studnets who take several courses since companies extremely desire individuals who have underwent and experienced a lot.</MI2> <SI2>Large companies are struggling with fabricating new invention due to the fact that they would be defeated by other firms unless they do not develop and improve themselves.

692&Whether it is better to take the most difficult and challenging classes in college or at university even if it means that you probably will not get top grades in them.,::,"<IN><EX>When I was a freshman in the college, one of my seniors recommended that I needed to take the most challenging class from the beginning, as it would help me to advance further in that field. I followed his advice, which became a totally disaster to my college life.</EX> <TS>I disagree with the argument that students have to take the most difficult class in the college, and I believe that it is better to take to class step by step reflecting one's own level.</TS> My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, we can learn more and better by taking an easier class at first, and going on a more advanced class.</MI1> <SI1>This means that following the class step by step based on his or her level helps us to learn more from the lecture, by understanding the class better. Learning is not the one that can be obtained at once. <TR>Generally</TR>, the advanced class in the university assumes that students who choose this class know the basic knowledge about this course. <TR>Thus</TR>, professor omits many fundamental principles and theories in the class, which are indispensable to understand the lecture. It is no exaggeration to say that those who do not take the easier class at first and do not know many basic principles certainly will abandon the advanced class after all. By building up many basic knowledge, we are more likely to follow the difficult and challenging class easily and not to give up. <EX><TR>In my case</TR>, I decided to major in economics when I entered the college. Freshmen usually were advised to take the class called, &quotThe principle of economics 1&quot at the first semester. <TR>However</TR>, my senior(who was also a mentor) recommended me to take the high level class called, &quotMicroeconomics&quot, saying there was no difference between the classes. I followed his advice but it was a big mistake. From my point of view, as a beginner, microeconomics was too challenging. I hardly caught any point from the professor and just stresses were piled up in my brain. Finally I had no choice but to drop the class and had to take the basic course in the summer vacation. If I had take the easier class, I would have enjoyed my first vacation as a college student.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, getting poor scores by taking a challenging class can affect negatively, such as looking for a good job or applying for a scholarship.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words</TR>, from the realistic point of view, taking easier class strategically and having good grade may help student to get a good reward in the future. When we apply for a scholarship or job, it is required to submit the transcript. The GPA(Grade Point Average) is very important to catch this chance. Especially, the scholar committees or human resource departments of many companies do not consider whether the applicant takes the challenging class or not. <TR>Thus</TR>, it will be recommended for many students who seek a fund of job to take the easier class and get good score. <EX>My friend was a good example.

693&Grade encourages students to learn. Agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>We often hear that students become exhausted by endless tests in the school. Test results turn into grades, and these grades are usually used as a criteria how good they are doing in the school. Many students complain that they become disappointed by the results if the grade are not good, insisting that we have to abolish the grading system to make students encourage to learn. <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this opinion and my view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, grade encourages student to learn as they make student have incentive to do well in the test.</MI1> <SI1>According to many studies about the humans' predisposition, people have a tendency not to digress and focus one specific thing if setting a goal. <TR>In this case</TR>, getting good grades can be a goal to students. Students are more willing to prepare for the test if they have the test, as getting good scores can be a big achievement. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a 4th grade students in the elementary school, my school's policy was to make students free from the stress caused by the grading system. <TR>Consequently</TR>, teachers was not allowed to take the test and evaluate the students ability based on their grades. <TR>However</TR>, in contrast to the belief that this policy will lead student to study harder, many students did not pay attention to the teachers' lecture in the class. Especially, students became motiveless due to the lack of the specific goal. After realizing this negative effect, the school changed its policy to make the grades strictly based on the test result. This change brought students to their desks and books. Students began to focus on their learning, and the virtuous cycle, &quotGrades made students to learn, and the their learning improved students' interest to study, which also led them to learn more.&quot was established. <TR>In my case</TR>, as I could check my score, I was determined to study harder if the score was somewhat low.</EX> From this experience, I can say that grade helps student to learn more.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, students can be motivated to study by comparing themselves to others.</MI2> <SI2>As people instinctively think of their comparative position in the group as an important factor, the hope of getting better grades than others motivates people to put into more efforts. <TR>For example</TR>, by checking one's relative status in the test, students can know whether they are better or worse, which leads them to study, to boost their comparative position. According to a study conducted by a Harvard University professor, 85% of the students surveyed answered that they were more likely to study when they got the test result which showed their rank in the class. They said that they wanted to know how well they were doing in the class, and grade was a good indication to reflect themselves. Especially, grade which had an objective scoring number made them to study harder and harder, to get good score in the next examination. This survey illustrates how important it is to make grade in our society to boost students' learning motive.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To conclude</TR>, I firmly believe that grade encourage students to learn, because it makes students have incentive to do well and beat over their classmates. <TR>Therefore</TR>, we should not be afraid by the test result. Rather, we should consider it as an opportunity to learn more and advance further.whether it is better to take the most difficult and challenging classes in college or at university even if it means that you probably will not get top grades in them.</CO>",::,5,::,0,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,An excellent essay!

This is because the investment on education for young children has not been produced good results and most of the curriculum for developing the country is in the university.</TS></IN>
 
 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the result of the investment on elementary education is not below expectations although the spending on it much more than higher educaiton.</MI1> <SI1>Over the last decade, there has been a trend that in order to grow next generation well, all members of our society and the government should pay attention to elementary education. Following this current, much budget for education has been spent on improving education surroundings in primary schools. <TR>In contrast</TR>, spending on higher education suffered budget cuts over 35 percent. <EX>Even though the government has been paid much money on elementary school, the eeconomic growth of Korea just slightly increased by 0.3 point compared to 10 years ago. <TR>However</TR>, in the case of China, they steadily spent their money and attention on university education, which leads to 8.3 percent economic growth rate.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, many courses directly related to developing factors of the country are included in the higher education.</MI2> <SI2>Unlike the university that encourages students to be a specialist, education institutes are likely to try to develope students general knowldege, which make good citizens who have common sense. <TR>However</TR>, in order to improve the country more efficiently, the government should focus on economy and engineering. This is because developments of the country primarily rely on specialized knowldege, such as economy, engineering, and law. According to a study conducted by Korea university, as our socity gets more complex, the aspects of the obstacles to develope also become more complicated, such as a lack of clean drinking water, imbalance in income. They do an experiment with two groups, first is specialist in specific area and second is laypeople.

696&Young people tend to less depend on their parents than in the past.,::,"<IN><TS>I side with the argument that current young people are more independent than previous young people.</TS> <TR>First</TR>, their dependency on parents is lower than before because they spend less time with their parents. <TR>Moreover</TR>, current parents have a tendency to offer less financial assistances to their children in order to prepare for their old ages.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, as spending time with families has reduced, young generation determines their daily decisions by their own rather than by parents.</MI1> <SI1>In highly competitive society, parents spend more time at work rather than at home. <TR>Thus</TR>, young people do not feel strong bonding with their parents because they spent time with their mates or alone rather than with parents. <TR>For example</TR>, recent studies has shown that young people less consider their parents’ advices importantly than 10 years ago.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, by preserving historic buildings, the effectiveness of history study could be quite improved.</MI1> <SI1>Even though there are several ways to learn history, schools in Korea have been teaching history just by textbook due to the realistic restrictions of study.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, cars are the most convenient means of transportation.</MI1> <SI1>In fact, other transportations cannot use with ease because of their high price and strict time table. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, airplane is much faster and larger than car but it is expensive to ride and we should go to the near airport to use.

If we have urgent meeting, nobody want to use ships.</EX> With this in mind, main means of transportations is stills cars than any other ones for the time being.</SI1></BO1>

The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on the individual perspectives. Thus, the jury may still be out but as far as I am concerned I agree with the statement.</TS> In this essay, I will present the two reasons supporting my standpoint as follow.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, scientists should share their own research for progressive social life as a leader of society.</MI1> <SI1>Although no one denies that such as valuable invents or discoveries are important as individual, it’s more justifiable to content that the scientist open their result of discoveries for common communities of welfare and the world of well-being, not only private purpose. <EX><TR>For illustration</TR>, I would like to draw the case of my experience when I was university student.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, announcing the significant discoveries among the middle of science is able to encourage the scientist to study in competitive environment.</MI2> <SI2>This will help to increase competitive power in the scientific fields of nation.

If one attract enough money to implement experiment from the government, one can concentrate on their specific area more effectively than ever before. Naturally, scientist quality will be improved through above mentioned virtuous circle. In this sense, it’s necessary to open discoveries among the scientist world, which leads advent of the strong scientific world.</SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, in grandparent's generation, the preference of job was different compared to modern days.</MI1> <SI1>Since the industrial society has been developed amazingly in modern day, the job trend has been changed too. <TR>Therefore</TR> old people's view of perfect job might be not suitable for in these days, thus their advice is very useless. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a little kid, my grandfather told me to be a great farmer because when he was young, the farmer was very popular job for common people and it was very stable job just like a public service worker in today. <TR>However</TR>, I knew it was not very proper job for right now, thus i refused his advice.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, the television provides more resources to talk among people, thus getting longer communication.</MI1> <SI1>There are various and numerous things that are televised, such as movie, audition show (American Idol), discovery program, and talk show. These shows definitely offer plenty chance to start conversation among the closed people. Most of teenagers greet each other by saying “hello”, and then the topic of the conversation automatically converts to the TV program shows that are being televised and popular among their ages. Hence, people can communicate more and reinforce their bond. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I was a middle school student, the words between the conversation of my friends and I was just simple greeting saying, such as “hi”, “hello”, or “how are you?” However, since the well-known audition program, “Superstar K”, in our country, our length of communication had been amazingly increased, thus made special brotherly bond with them. Had it not been for this audition program, I would even have any friends.</EX></S1></BO1>
           
<BO2><MI2><TR>Last but not least</TR>, our speaking capacity can be advanced.</MI2> <SI2>There are many discussion and talk shows that are broadcasting on the TV in these days. A variety of people love to watch these shows. Since most of MC of the shows are great speaker, people learn and imitate their talking style, thus learning many communicative expressions. <EX>The case of this point is that one of my friend, David, who usually did not talk with people due to his retard talking expressions. However, once he has watched “The Oprah Winfrey Show”, his speaking ability suddenly advance. This show automatically helped him to learn how to express their feeling well in oral way.

First, by learn about the relationship between the subject and his future, a student can realize the importance of taking that subject. Second, it can also help students to prepare for their future to come.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>Explaining how much the subject helps outside the school does not only increase the interest of students, but also help them to realize the need of the subject.</MI1> <SI1>Once a student realize the importance of a class, it becomes easier for him to focus in the class. It was already reported that the students, who said that they knew the importance of the classes they were taking, tended to show the higher level of concentration.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2>School education shouldn’t be just about passing the tests and graduating.</MI2> <SI2>Through the curriculum, a student has to be ready for the future to come. Getting informed about how the subject will be helpful outside the school helps students to prepare for future. <EX><TR>Let me take my experience as an example</TR>. Before my senior year in high school, I already knew what I wanted to do in my future, so I went to each teacher and asked them about how the subjects would help me to prepare for what I wanted to do, marketing.

However, in my opinion, I think that it is infeasible to completely be truthful with friends.</TS> This is because people usually tell lies to cover their flaws, and because they tell white lies to friends to make their friends feel better.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many people lie to their friends to hide their shortcomings.</MI1> <SI1>To be specific, we usually do not tell real facts of family relations or physical secrets to keep our attraction and reputation high. <EX><TR>For example</EX>, when I was in primary school, my almost every friends knew about 'DIGIMON', which is a famous Japanese cartoon. <TR>However</TR>, I did not know anything about that, and I did not want to be disesteemed or ignored by other friends.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, many people are now trying to make their lives simple.</MI2> <SI1>To be specific, the new movement of which main idea is to recover the humbleness and peace of mind by restricting desire has gotten popularity among people. The leader of the movement suggested that if people throw away their desire to have something more and are satisfied with their current place, people can get the peace of mind that makes people free and are even good for health. So a lot of people tired of consuming or wanting something more in the modern society are willing to take part in the movement, and they try to reduce their desire for consuming something more following the lessons from the movement.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, charity activities become more popular than before.</MI2> <SI2>A study conducted by the government shows that the number of people who participate in charity activities regularly has increased 15% since 2010. Many people in charity activities share what they have such as money, time, and so on. This stream is because people realized that stability of society can be achieved by sharing something that they have with other people. I think this stream in the society is the strong evidence that people want to share what they have rather than to have more and more.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, considering the fact that the new movement has gained a lot of support from people and the number of people who take part in charity activities is increasing, I believe that the idea that people are never satisfied with what they have is not adequate.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Most of all</TR>, unlike other places, school and workplace are where people go every day, yet it is not easy to wear differently from day to day.</MI1> <SI1>Some people get stressed out paying attention to how to dress up. Therefore, if they have a series of standard for clothes at work or school, People can focus on their tasks and assignments more because they do not have to worry about clothes as much as if they do not. Likewise, rules concerning clothes at specific places help people have less pressure about clothes so that they can spend their time more productively.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, if people wear similar clothes, they would feel that they belong together and unified.</MI2> <SI2>Also it prevents people to have prejudice of one another. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, students whose schools have a regulation about uniform feel less pressure than other students in schools without the regulation. During the age of puberty, they are very sensitive about clothes because in peer group, they discriminate themselves and make different groups by clothes.</EX> In this way, rules for clothes can be the alternative for those disunions in society such as school or work through wearing same clothes.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In summary<TR>, I am in favor of the opinion that there should be rules about clothes at work or school because they prevent people to waste their time thinking what to wear every morning, and consolidate them as if they are united by garments.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,I don't think the essay is quite on topic.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, Paying attention to student can help them studying in a good atmosphere.</MI1> <SI1>This is because student feels more comfortable when teacher acts familiarly. So, they can ask and answer the questions easily. According to a recent survey conducted by Joonang Newspaper, communication between teacher and student is really significant for student’s study.

<BO1><MI1>Although we have been told about the importance of getting a good grade in school, graduating high school with a better grade is not the ultimate goal of a student.</MI1> <SI1><TR>After graduating</TR>, one face the real world, which is totally different from the school they have spent their last ten years. In the real world, every day is different; rather than just attneding school every day and doing the works provided from school, one has to find his own works to do. One will be facing new circumstances every day, and if only he has done during his school years was just getting a good grade it will be hard for him to adjust in new environments. Many studies have shown that, surprisingly, the students, who enjoyed adventures and learned how to adapt changing conditions during their school years, tend to better in the real world compared to those who just focused on getting more knowledge and nothing else.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2>Even if I high lighted the importance of learning how to adapt changing circumstances, it is also important to learn good knowledge in a field.</MI2> <SI2>However many people don't realize that how the skill to adjust in a new condition can be a base for getting good grade. <EX><TR>Let me take my experience as an example</TR>.

<BO1><MI1>Before TV was invented, it took few days to few months till one hears about an event from the opposite side of where he lives. But since TV was invented, it has played a role of a window for us, which displays the view of the world.</MI1> <SI1>Now, even if something happens in Africa, it takes only few hours for one, who lives in America, to hear about it. <EX><TR>Let me take my experience as an example</TR>.

Philosophical problems and legitimatic issues are intertwined with the availability for teenagers to work. Some people are against with the early working because there would be certain problems if teenagers work such as they have to concentrate on their study and they can be exploited by greedy employers. <TS>However I strongly believe that there are many advantages when teenagers have jobs.</TS></IN>
     
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teenagers can build independency by having jobs.</MI1> <SI1>If teenagers are paid for their work, they learn how to manage their wage and how much it is difficult to earn money. They learn why they have to be responsible for their tasks. I could realize this fact through my experiences. Friends who have worked from their teen are usually more responsible for their jobs and do better on their academic subjects than who did not have had jobs before. Also, we can prove it by observing successful people. Many successful people in the world worked very early. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, Ju-Young Jung, founder of Hyundai, and Ruyichi Konoske, founder of Mitsubichi, didn’t even graduate elementary school but they had accumulated more feats than the most of people who received higher educations.</EX></SI1></BO1>

"722&For the successful development of the country, the government should spend more money on very young children (the age five to ten) than on the university education. ",::,"<IN>Today, there are so many young children going abroad to study regardless of their intention.
And this phenomenon comes from obsessive parents who stick to their children's successful future.
<TS>However, I whole-heartedly believe that this advance education for young children is meaningless to become successful country with following two reasons.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>First and foremost</TR>, it is useless for young children to educate something for development of country.</MI1> <SI1>Since advance education has become popular, most of wealthy parents force their kids to study abroad due to the fast absorption of knowledge of young kids based on the scientific research. Although government should invest money for successful future and prospect of country, kids are too young to understand everything. The reason behind this is they are immature to overcome against any obstacles.
According to the research about the failure of advance education from the Ministry of Education of Korea, it says that as the more kid go abroad, the more children come back because they failed to adopt other cultures and language problem and kids without any goals seemed to easily get tired of it. It also turns out that most of kids wanted to come back to their country where their parents live in that they were still young to stay away from their parents. Lastly it warns that hasty advance education would influence their kids to have negative effect emotionally.
Likewise, although encouraging young kids to study would increase their own potential, it is too risky to force them to study.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, university students have a good understanding of information adopting any environment.</MI2> <SI2>As regular education from middle, high school is made by law, most of university students have learned many subjects from lots of experienced teachers.

Some might argue that cooperation has a positive effect to friendship. <TS>My view, however, is that competition does not give bad effect on friendship, on the contrary that gives friends good influence.</TS> This is largely because competition is good way to improve their ability. Moreover, when friends finish competition among them, they will be more intimate each other.</IN>
 
<BO1>                  <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, one way to improve oneself is competition.</MI1> <SI1>In the case of a person try to develop his ability, the person should be get rival.

According to a study conducted by a team of researchers at Harvard University, More than two-thirds of the surveyed participants who attend high school improve their grades when they have competition among friends. Based on study, it seems clear that competition enhance people’s capacity</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2>                  </MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, friendship can be stronger than when the friends does not compete each other.</MI2> <SI2>Commonly most of the people who has rival interest in his rival. When friends regard their friends as rival, they can interest their friends more frequently. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, one of my friends who want to learn how to play basketball considered me as rival.

<BO1><MI1><TR>The first reason is</TR> that if children play sports in competition, they can adjust the experience to their future society life when they become adults.</MI1> <SI1>In general, people often work in compete society and get precious results from these competitions. If children play sports for just joyfulness, their desire which overcome and win someone will decrease. It is not helpful for them to live society actively. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my best friend, Bob lately realized that a grade of his sun was not good. After thinking the cause, he sent his sun to Taegwando institute. His sun matched his friends everyday by using diverse Taegwando skills.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Another compelling reason is</TR> that playing sports while competing each other makes people fun.</MI2> <SI2>In common, people including children cannot feel any joyfulness while playing friendly matches because they cannot get a prize or a role of winner. Thus they feel boring easily and eventually give up playing sports. <EX>A study at the University of North Carolina revealed that soccer players who belong to the university have different minds depending on the type of matches. If they play friendly match, they play the game in condition of relaxing. Otherwise, if they play tournament match, they play the game while having more concentration and tension.</EX> Furthermore, they get more a sense of accomplishment, satisfication and fun from the competitive match.

<BO2>           <MI2><TR>On the top of that</TR>, people are easily motivated by money compared to public recognition.</MI2> <SI2>Usually, for the public recognition, companies will held a ceremony and claim one’s hard working in front of other workers. However, this ceremony is just a moment. Not only do employees forget the ceremony quickly, but also the prize winner cannot remember the entire celebration words from the boss. However, money, a gift, is hardly forgettable and may remain in one’s mind for a lone time. Therefore, rewarding money has more influences on employees. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, Benz Company gave my father a celebration party due to his great devotion to the cooperation. The boss appreciated him greatly that time, and he felt proud of himself. However, after few days, nobody could remember who was celebrated during the party even the boss which made my father upset.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO1><MI1>Time came that job opportunities do not get by easily and one needs to be professionally trained to acquire excellent  job prospects.</MI1> <SI1>University is a perfect place for those who seek for a stable job these days. Without expertise in any field, people are unlikely to succeed in today’s highly competitive job market. Those with college degrees are more competent job candidates than those with high school diploma and this will remain true for the future. Whether one has attended university will be a criterion for measuring knowledge and capability of job candidate for the job.</SI1></BO1>
     
<BO2><MI2>Besides building up job prospects, university help people rediscover their interest and endowment.</MI2> <SI2>Although university applicants may not have academic interest in the first place, college education can arouse their interest in certain field and spur their academic endeavor. University is so structured that students can pursue education in specialized fields along with required liberal art classes. <EX>People whose major was not music may come to like music or realize their musical talent later. Those whose focus was not academics may grow scholarly passion out of certain fields of study.</EX> University is a place where students can find their talent and zeal for education and navigate the route toward the future. A roadmap to success is drawn by not only academic excellence but also good understanding of themselves and what they pursue. University will fulfill this role as an institution for higher education.</SI2></BO2>
     
<BO3><MI3>Attending universities, people attain life chances when they learn to act independently.</MI3> <SI3>Graduating from high schools, people pass several stages to become respectful adults. University students learn to live independently from their parents by getting a house, paying tuition, and making life decisions on their own. They eventually learn life lessons like financial responsibility, social relationships, and standing up by themselves. College experience would be a priceless life education for people who are yet to become adults. From the relationship with other people than parents, one will stay connected with a variety of companions who will teach the importance of forming social network and accepting difference of people.</SI3></BO3>
     
<CO>University education has once been regarded as privilege for some students, but it is widely recognized as required education for all students.

741&Getting advice from friends of an older age is more valuable than from friends you own age,::,"<IN> In this dog-eat-god world, it is very important for people to get advice from friends of an older age. <TR>In this regards</TR>, some might suggest taking advice from the same old friends is better as it can be easy to talk about. <TS><TR>However<TR>, contrary to such belief, I strongly argue that it is beneficial for people to listen to the counsel of elders. In this essay, I will illustrate two reason for my opinion.</TS></IN>

<BO1> <MI1>My first reason has to do with practicality. With more and more people focused on improving their quality of life, getting practical advice from elders is a must.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In light of this situation</TR, receiving tips from older peer would be optimal for finding feasible solutions. <EX><TR>To illustrate this point</TR>, when I was applying for registering for courses, I tried to make decisions by myself. I had two choice between the basis of math and that of physics, and struggled with the question for many days. <TR>Near the deadline</TR>, I was so stressed out that I could not eat nor sleep. I had no choice but to ask a senior in my school for help. Not only I was advised that math is better in my case, but also he gave me fruitful information for overall curriculum. I believed his words,and I have never looked back on my decisions. I had not done so, I would not have been able to get a useful fact.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, taking a hint from a senior allows people to trust in more.</MI2> <SI2>The rationale behind this is they have an insight into diverse situation from undergoing experiences. <TR>In other words</TR>, by receiving advice from a higher grade person, individuals will be able to gain an upper-hand in credibility. <EX>A good example of this can be seen from when I suffered from a selection whether applying for exchange student is useful or not. To prepare for an exchange student, it is necessary for me to take a English exam. As studying in abroad demands for high scores of test, I was lack of self-confidence and I did not know exactly if it deserves challenge. The more I think, the more I was confused. I tried to ask a friend entering a school in the same time for help, but he could not response to my source of trouble. Inevitably, I determined to send for help to a senior. Not only he help me to broaden horizon, but also he boost me confidence. <TR>As a result</TR>, I applied for an interchange student.</EX> This is the one of the best things I choose in my life.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In a nutshell</TR>, despite the fact that talking to a same old friend for advice may have some advantages, from my personal opinion, I strongly believe that merits of appealing for help to older friends outweigh those of the opposition.

742&Television Advertising directed toward children undeer the age of five should not be allowed.,::,"<IN> In our current society, TV advertisement has a tremendous importance in our lives. <TS>Some people think that TV advertisement directed toward under 5 years old should be permitted. <TR>I however</TR>, believe that it should be abandoned for the following reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1> <MI1> <TR>To begin with</TR>, the most vital reason for my thinking this way is that kids under 5 years old do not have ability to divide between reality and fantasy(or vituality).</MI1> <SI1><TR>Thus</TR>, children have tendency to imitate actions that they have seen in TV commercial. According to the news article that I saw a few days ago, children jumped down at the handrail of his apartment. Background to this action, he often had seen TV advertisement that a baby who wears supermen costume fly in the sky, and he follow its action.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, children do not have insight that which products have good quality and durability, they just choose goods that attract them in impulse.</MI2> <SI2></EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I bought a new car, I went to the car dealer shop several times and searched in car maniac’s internet cafes etc.<TR></EX> Such as my experience</TR>, adults usually spend much time to buy something they need. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, children usually are captivated by glossy TV advertisement, and they pester his mother to buy goods that had seen in the commercial. Human’s desire is infinite, but resources available are restricted. <TR>Thus,</TR>, children should learn reasonable values to buy, not by TV advertisement.</SI2></BO2>

743&It is better to focus on one project at a time and then another one.,::,"<IN> <TS>an intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether it is better to focus on one project at a time or not. The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. <TR>Thus</TR>, the jury can may still be out, as far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement.</TS> In this esaay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as folloes. <TR>First</TR>, Focusing on one project is more effective in spending time. <TR>Second</TR>, It is able to make person have a more sense of purpose.</IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, I believe that people having on project at a time spend time more effective.</MI1> <SI1>This is because, people usually pay more attention on project than they have a lot of project. It is obvious that people can promote their attention skill having just one plan. <EX><TR>From my experience</TR>, when I was a college freshmean, I had a part-time job in restaurant for my pocket money. AT that time, since I spent a lot of time in my part-time job, I paid little attention on my grade. <TR>As a result</TR>, I got a poor grade and I failed to earn a tuition.</EX> In these sense, I strongly think that When people have one plan to do, they use their time efficiently.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2> <MI2><TR>On the top of that</TR>, Having one project let people gain a more sense of purpose.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the reason that people are free from the distraction which they may have had. <EX>Suppose you have three project which must be finished on this month. You have three sense of purpose, and you are motivated various projects. It makes you lose your attention and distracts your ability. <TR>Finally</TR>, you could be failed one of that projects, and be depressed your achievement which can not accomplish.</EX> Like above, If people have one purpose, It would improve your sense of purpose and ability.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO>In conclusion, I strongly argue for my standpoint on accout of two reasons mentioned above. <TR>Once again</TR>, although the verdict can may still be out, I personally belive that two of my rationales above are sufficiently convincing the viewpoint of a majority of people who are in favor of my opinion.</CO> ",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Many grammar and semantic errors that caused the essay to stumble sometimes.

744&high school students should be allowed to choose some of the classes.,::,"<IN><TS>Some people think that students should be free to choose some of their subjects in high school. <TR>However</TR>, in my opinion, I strongly believe that high school students should take all the classes they are required to attend because it can help them to choose their major in college and have a positive effect on their grades.</TS></IN>
 
           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, students can benefits from taking all the classes in high school because the exposure to many different fields can help students decide their major in university.</MI1> <SI1>Often times, students do not know what they want to do or what they are best suited for unless they actually experience a variety of fields. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my high school made several subjects optional. Among them, was a Japanese class. Back then, I didn’t feel that I liked Japanese very much, so I didn’t take it. <TR>Then</TR>, later it turned out that I have a lot of interest in learning foreign languages, and even though I chose literature as my major, I decided to change to Japanese language. Had I been required to take the Japanese class in high school I wouldn’t have had wasted my effort and time on something I didn’t really have much interest in.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
           <BO2> <MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, taking a variety of classes can be helpful in getting good grades because by studying many dissimilar subjects, one can stimulate many different parts of their brain, which boosts their brain activity.</MI2> <SI2><TR>Similarly</TR>, experts in various fields often get inspirations from something outside their specialty. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, in his book ‘The Elegant Universe’, Brian Greene, professor of physics at Columbia university expressed his fascination for music and described how he got an inspiration for explaining vibrating strings of matter from musical instruments. (according to string theory, strings are fundamental constituents that make up all matter in our universe.- if we look at subatomic particles such as electrons, quarks at an ultramicroscopic level we may find tiny little vibrating strings of energy). He drew an analogy between the way the strings in stringed instruments vibrate and the way the strings of energy vibrate by saying that just like different ways in which the strings in an instrument produce different musical notes, different ways in which strings in string theory vibrate generate different physical properties.</EX> This clearly shows that exposing oneself to a wide range of areas can be beneficial in terms of improving one’s performance in whatever they are doing.</SI2></BO2>
 
           <CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, I think that high school students should attend all the required classes because it can benefit them in ways that help to decide on their major in college and promote their overall brain health which ,in turn, leads to higher grades.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,The first supporting idea example was not very strong.

<BO1> <MI1><TR>First</TR>, neighbors who are nice to each others can turn to really close friends.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>Let me use my experience as an example</TR>. When my family moved to a new town five years ago, we didn’t know anyone lived near us, so we decided to be friendly and meet our neighbors to introduce ourselves.

746&Universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries.,::,"<IN> Some people believe that it is not necessary for universities to spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries. <TR>This is because</TR>, by sending much money on libraries, students can get better studying environment so that they can concentrate better on studying which is main reason why they are in the university.
<TS><TR>However</TR>, I think I disagree with the statement that universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries.</TS> There are two reasons why I feel this way. First reason is that doing exercise is as much important as studying. Second reason is that supporting sports provide more opportunity for students to socialize.</IN>
      
<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, universities should spend much money on sports because managing health is much more important than studying.</MI1> <SI1>In this competition society, most people spend their time on studying rather than exercising. Since people lack of exercising, their health getting worsen and become depressed. It can cause serious criminals and committing suicide in future. <TR>However</TR>, as universities spend much money on sports, they can give students good environment to exercise, which helps to avoid those problems. Most people who don’t exercise have a good excuse of not having enough places to exercise or it is too cold to do exercise outside in winter. But they turn their mind to do exercise if there are adaptable place for exercising. <TR>Therefore</TR>, those environments help students to exercise.</SI1></BO1>
      
<BO2> <MI2> <TR>On top of that</TR>, spending much money on sports as they do on libraries, provide more opportunity to socialize.</MI2> <SI2>This is due to the fact that, by universities providing more places or adaptable environmental, many people, even who haven’t interested in sports, gather in those places. By gathering in the places, it is good opportunity for them to make new friends. As they make new friends, they can relieve their stress. Relieving stress can improve students’ academic abilities. <TR>Therefore</TR>, providing more places to exercise can relieve students’ stress as well as improve their academic abilities.</SI2></BO2>
       
<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, by universities spend much money on sports as they do on libraries, students are more able to care of their health and have more opportunity to socializing. <TR>For these reasons</TR>, I believe that universities should spend as much money on sports as they do on libraries.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,"The thesis was worded wrong.

747&Boys and girls should be educated in separate classrooms using different teaching techniques.(agree disagree) Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN><TS>Some people say that boys and girls should be educated in separate classrooms using different teaching techniques. They insist that it would provide better educational atmosphere for children. <TR>However</TR> I disagree with the idea for two different reasons.</TS> <TR>First</TR>, coed system offers a better environment, and <TR>second</TR>, if teachers separate boys and girls, it can cause the kids to be antisocial.</IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1>Students tend to focus better in a coed education.</MI1> <SI1>Students can easily be distracted by their friends with same gender. <EX><TR>Let me take my experience as an example</TR>. For my middle school years, I went to the school, in where they separate children according to their sexes. Although some people believed that was efficient, I don’t think the system really worked. The boys were quiet violent compared to the girls, and the girls were way too chatty compared to the boys. So there were always fights going on in boys’ classes, and it was really hard for teachers to lead girls’ classes when they would never stop talking in class.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2> <MI2><TR>Also</TR> many studies have shown that many students graduated from non-coed schools tend to grow to be antisocial.</MI2> <SI2>Since their schools separated them from the different gender, they never had an opportunity to interact with them.

By separating their kids, non-coed school can take these opportunities from their kids and force them to grow antisocial.</SI2></BO2>

 <BO1> <MI1> <TR>To begin with</TR>, People are able to live happily by abandoning their possession, so people tend to be content with what they have.</MI1> <SI1>In other words, people are stressed out when they are willing to take care of their possession and struggle to achieve a higher goal. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, in my middle school days, I was always stressed out from a sense of incompatibility.

<BO1><MI1>First reason that everyone would agree is that technology, such as computer or television brings children's creativity by giving them a lot of information.</MI1> <SI1>Environments to learn and experience are given to them. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, most of children are extremely curious and technology grants them many information about places where they cannot go.

Although I admit its advantages, I strongly beleive that childhood is more important for inhancing intellectual capability than any other period.</TS> The reasons are that it is easy to acquire knowledge and one's habit and characters are formed in childhood.</IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, childrens are very easily obtain new information.</MI1> <SI1>That is, they are curious about what they see aroud them and ready to acquire information directly. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, children learn foreign language much faster than their parents or teenagers when they live in foreing country.

<BO2> <MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, habits and characters are formed in childhood.</MI2> <SI2>Thus when childrens are used to studying and enjoy concentrating on some subject, it is more likely that they will keep their preference and lifestyle even when they grow up.

770&technology makes children less creative,::,"<IN> <TS>Our generation is benefitting from many developed technology and I am sure that next generation will be. <TR>In my opinion</TR>, I believe that technology does not harm creativeness of children.</TS> My opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1> <MI1> <TR>First</TR>, there is no logical relationship between technology and our children’s creativeness. In other words, children do not really care about technology, and they actually do not know what they are.</MI1> <SI1><EX><TR>For example</TR>, if a mom gives her ipod to her babies, he(or she) interested them as new thing which he see the first time.</EX> <TR>Also</TR>, many of electronic methods are bought by their parents, not children, so technology is not really responsible for lack of children’s creativeness.</SI1><BO1>

Some people may think this is more expedient than leaving home and going to the office. <TR>However</TR>, I strongly disagree with the statement that it is better to work alone at home than to work with others at a company for some reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people can interact with others if they are at a company.</MI1> <SI1>Talking on the phone or sending an e-mail is not any better than actually meeting each other and seeing the faces. As there is an old saying that human beings are social animals who cannot live alone, it is much more desirable for people to go out to work and literally interact with people. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my brother had thought working at home by himself would be better than going to work.  For that reason, he decided to telecommute and stay home; however, he felt so lonely and boring working all alone and changed his mind to go work at a company.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2> <TR>On the top of that</TR>, while working with other people, they can learn something new from each other.</MI2> <SI2>When people are together, they are more likely to make a synergistic effect and give other some brilliant ideas. <EX><TR>In my own case</TR>, my team, the marketing department, were working for an advertisement of our company's new product.

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, if people work together at a company, they interact with others and become more sociable. Working alone at home will give them much loneliness.

The answer of this question can vary greatly, depending on individual perspectives. <TR>Thus</TR>, jury may still be out, but as far as i concerned, i agree with the statement.</TS> In this essay, i will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.</IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1><TR>First</TR>, people can fabricate most of their attitudes for learning in their childhood.</MI1> <SI1>In details, people who read variety of books in their childhood feel easy to read articles and learn new knowledge.  <TR>On the other hand</TR>, people who used to watch televison instead of books, they become adults who are not familiar with understanding articles and obtaining new information. <TR>In this respect</TR>, childhood bears significant meaning for a person's intellectual power.</SI1></BO1>
 <BO2> <MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, in their childhood, people bring their own way of  consideration in existence.</MI2> <SI2>In particular, the environment of young age has significant meaning at forming a person's  own viewpoints. Adults who spent their childhood in rural parts, usually think in direction of environment and nature. <TR>On the opposite part</TR>, people who have been grown in urban area, they usually get the way of thinking in capitalism and the success. In details, knowledge and experiences gotten during a person's juvenile time remains much more than generally thought. As you know, there is a quote 'What is learned in cradle is carried to the tomb', showing that a little amount of knowledge taken in young age affects a person's whole life. In this sense, the time of childhood is the most important to determine a person's intellectual faculty.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly argue of my standpoint on account of two reasons mentioned above.

I strongly disagree the given statement because of the following reasons.</TS></IN>

<BO1> <MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a movie helps us escape from a real life.</MI1> <SI1>As a matter of fact, in modern society, there are a lot of things lead us be worn out and we are given  stressful situations surrounding us. As a result, many people dream of not being isolated from a real life and as a way to escape from their problems, they come by a theater to spend a time for their recreation.

What do we have to do for our fresh ideas. the key to be creative depends on escaping from the ordinary life and movies which are genre of fantasy would help you to think more and more. To be specific, SF movies does not show us an impossible thing. Not only it will give you a challenging mind but also, breaks up the social rule achieved. by seeing the movie, as a designer, not only I was challenged but also adjusted something new to the furniture like a flying bed.Such an idea comes from the scene stimulating me to be more creative.

776&Every generation of people is different in important ways. How is your generation different from your parents’ generation? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.,::,"<IN> Our parents lived in the period of cataclysm. They experienced every life-style from agriculture society to modern society which was existed in the planet earth. My parent born at around 1960s, at that time in Korea, the mainstay of national GDP is agricultural goods despite the beginning of industrialization. When parent were at the age of 20s, there was incredible increase of GDP which is caused by industrialization. In addition, in 1980s, there wasn’t occurred only an economic change, but also a political change. A perennial dictatorship from the president Park Jung-hee was ended by democratic movement. After politics are stabilized, the main stream of world economy and industry was moved to modern technology, which is an intellectual technology. Needless to say, the world where we are living now is made by the enormous endeavor of the parents of us. They built the today’s modern society.</IN>

<BO1> <TS>In contrast to the parents’ generation, our generation is expressly different to theirs.</TS> <MI1><TR>First</TR>, we succeed the successful modern society with a critical pollution.</MI1> <SI1>The side-effects of some changes are unavoidable, and the side-effect of the development what our parents achieved is the pollution.

777&Movies are worth watching only when they teach us something about real life.,::,"<IN> <TS>I strongly disagree that movie are worth watching only when they teach us something about real life.</TS> There are several reasons I could discuss to support my arguments so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are most relevant to the topic.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, Main reason for my feeling this way is associated with the concept of ingenuity.</MI1>

 <SI1>Fiction movies don`t show something about real life. Its authors aim to describe something new and ingenious. When we who are accustomed to ordinary and routine life meet and see their new work, we can expand our limited thought and have new perspective and way which we look at material. This is why that such a movie is related to the originality. <EX>A really nice example can be seen in Avatar(movie) which is made in 2009. This movie is very popular and evaluated positively all over the world because this showed new and fresh story like animal which cannot be seen on the earth, land floating on the earth, character of alien which is different from human.</EX> These new stories can motivate and help us to think with special and new view. Even though this movie doesn`t depict something about real life, it have another advantages as mentioned above.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2> Another reason for my argument is related to the concept expansion of fiction.</MI2> <SI2><EX>Avatar shows a fight between greedy humans and alien. We don`t stop confining their fight to themselves.</EX> We can apply this to various things like struggle between race and race, human and nature, country and country.

778&It is important that children start learning foreign language as early as possible.,::,"<IN> <TS>I think it is not necessary for students to learn foreign language as early as possible.</TS> Current phenomenon that young child devotes most of their time to foreign language suggests many parents that it is through early start that children masters foreign language. I repudiate this argument and assert that it is not too late to study native language first and learn foreign language later. The reason why I believe so is that children should be aware of native language for subsequent education, and through learning native language their national root and origin will be formed upon which basic knowledge and patriotism develops.</IN> 

<BO1> <MI1>Admitting that children possess aptitude for quick learning of language at their young age, native language has overriding importance for all children.</MI1>  <SI1>Such is the phenomenon that most parents endeavor to  educate English to their children by sending to English academy when they are yet to go to primary school. For all their efforts, the efficiency of English education is in question. Although children may absorb English very quickly as if it is their native language, they are not able to attain the full understanding of language.  Many parents do not seem to realize that native language is a priority as it is a foundation of solid understanding of other disciplines. Dedicating one’s effort to learning native language will strengthen the understanding of high-level curriculum and ameliorate the capability to study any subject including foreign language. Proficiency of primary language is a key to survive through arduous post-secondary education and it needs to be preceded before jumping on to any foreign language.  Besides, everyone will realize that only through mastery of their native language comes true understanding of foreign language.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2>Another rationale that native language should be followed by foreign language is people should be aware of where they come from.</MI2> <SI2>Language is an important part of formation of the national root and knowledge that are essential to the development of children. <EX>If one’s origin is Mexican they should know about Mexico, and if one’s origin is Korean they should know about Korea.</EX> This holds true for people of any other origin. Launching on foreign language before mastery of native language is analogous to building a house without firm foundation. Knowing about one’s nationality and national language is the very foundation upon human knowledge develops. It is too early to learn foreign language before the most essential knowledge of their identity and nationality is firmly rooted. This lifelong lesson will develop the children into sophisticated and refined adults by reminding them of who they are and where they came from.</SI2></BO2> 

<CO>Amidst ardent pursuit of foreign language education among young children, the importance of instilling native language in childhood is constantly undermined. Though  I understand that earlier learning of foreign language attains earlier mastery of it, I strongly would suggest children to concentrate on learning native language in young age.  Native language will strengthen understanding of other subjects in higher curriculum and develop them to excellent students in competitive educational environment. Their fluency of native language will prepare themselves for complete understanding of foreign language. <TR>Moreover</TR>, through primary language education they will acquire priceless lessons about their nationality and origin which later develops them into refined and sophisticated people. I am confident that this quality comes before bringing up our children into cosmopolitan people who are fluent at foreign language but lack the most essential knowledge of education.</CO>    ",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,"Support ideas could have used more data or examples, and clearer transitions could have been used, but otherwise this was a good essay.",//

782&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for students to study history and literature than it is for them to study science and mathematics.,::,"<IN> <TS>Thought-provoking current issue concerns whether students should give weight to history and literature or science and mathematics. Personally, I strongly disagree with above topic saying that studying history and literature is more important than science and math.</TS> To support my reasons, I am going to enumerate reasons below from now on.</IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, we have to aware of the validity of historical facts.</MI1> <SI1>Since we've never been to past, we don't exactly know what happend then. According to this saying ' History is written by the winner.', our knowledge of past may be a fake. It could be saying too much, but we have to admit the fact that winners are likely to forge the history and make it advantageous to them. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, strong country's can describe them as a righteous country and others to be savage. If we take it seriously, we know that history cannot be 100% exactly right.</EX> <TR>On the other hand</TR>, Mathmatics always have the manifest answer. There could not be a forge on mathmatics. '1+1=2' This fomula is easy, simple and above all things, certain.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2> <MI2> <TR>Secondly</TR>, even though literature is important subject to learn, still It is too subjective.</MI2> <SI2>People could translate it in many different ways. So to speak, there is not exact answer to defining literatures. <TR>In contrast</TR>, scientific fact's can't be subjective. They are objective facts confirmed by many other experiments. <EX>Chemistry, as an example, has to be clear. If it's not, it could cause explosions or fatal harm to a conductor.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO>These are the reasons why I think Science and Math are more essential than history and Literature.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,The main ideas basically state that something that is open to interpretation is not worth learning.  A connection should be established as to why subjectivity automatically makes it useless information.,//
783&It is better to focus on one project at a time and then start another one.,::,"<IN> There is an argument over whether focusing on one project at a time is better than multitasking several works at once. Some might argue that the multitasking skill is better as it is highly valued in our society. <TS><TR>My view, however</TR>, is that by concentrating on one project at a time, people will be able to concentrate their work more. Moreover, people are able to feel a sense of achievement.</TS></IN>
           <BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, focusing on one project enables people to concentrate their work even better when they have only one work to deal with.</MI1> <SI1>If people divide their attention among several tasks, they are more likely to become distracted and that is when errors occur. On the contrary, if a person focuses on one task, he or she will not make as many mistakes. According to a study conducted by a team of researchers at Harvard University, doing multiple works at the same time resulted in up to 15 percent more errors than focusing on a single task.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2> <TR>Furthermore</TR>, people can acquire a greater sense of satisfaction by finishing one project at a time.</MI2> <SI2>In many cases, people can feel a sense of achievement by completing their work faster. What is more, they do not need to stress over multiple tasks deadlines. <EX>Back in college, I used to undergo a great deal of stress whenever I had many research papers due around the same time. Then, one of my teachers suggested that I try to finish one paper before starting another one. At first, I remained skeptical towards the idea but I tried and it worked. I actually had no problem completing all of my assignments before their due dates so I felt a greater sense of achievement and relief.</EX></SI2></BO2>

           <CO> <TR>To summarize</TR>, the benefits of focusing on one project at a time far outweigh those of multitasking on the grounds that it can prevent from making errors so people can get high quality works. <TR>Not only that</TR>, but it also can provide people with opportunities to feel a sense of achievement by finishing their work much faster and quickly.</CO>",::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Some grammar and semantic issues but overall this is a good essay.,//
784&why do people work ?,::,"<IN> <TS>People work for many reasons.  Some works for money, some people work for their fame and reputation. People also work for achieving their goals of life. As we see here, people works for various reasons concerning his or her own situation.</TS> Those three reasons i enumerated above, is what I think for the topic.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, if we don't work, we will basically not afford anything to buy.</MI1> <SI1>As we all know, we need money to buy stuffs like house, foods and clothes. If we work, inevitably the money supply will be severed. <TR>If so</TR>, we would not be able to sustain our own lives. <TR>Thus</TR> people work to get money. Not only to sustain our lives but people also earn them to spend money. Some people be luxurious and buy new cars, clothes and even unnecessary things. According to my friend who spend money a lot, they do those things for solving their stress. <TR>To sum up</TR>, the first reason of working is to make money, and use them up in two above options.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2><TR>Also</TR>, as I mentioned above, some other people work for their fame and reputation.<MI2> <SI2>By being famous, one could be happy. For me, I think I would be happy if I become famous. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, some celebrities works(do their jobs) to be famous. I virtually saw one famous celebrity interviewing and saying that she wanted to be a famous.</EX> This surely clarifies that there are people who works for fame and reputation.</SI2></BO2>

<BO3> <MI3> <TR>Lastly</TR>, there are people working to achieve their dreams.<MI3> <SI3>I personally think this reason is the most rational reason above all. Generally speaking, I assume most people have their dreams. Dentist, Firefighter, Scientist or lawyer could be an example of it. And when they became what they wanted to be, they work for pursuit of happiness. They feel happiness while they are working. I think this is the last reason why people work.</SI3></BO3>

<CO>These are my opinions for above topic. People could work for one of those idea, or could work for all of those ideas. <TR>However</TR>, the most important thing is, to do something we love to do.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Many grammar and semantic errors but otherwise this is a good essay.,//
"785&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should
sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons
and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN> <TR>Generally speaking</TR>, there are things that are not favorable to do. One of the example is studying. There may be people enjoy studying, but generally we don't really study because we like to. It is because it is student's responsibility and inevitable knowledge to adapt to our society. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, even though we don't enjoy, there are things that we've got to do.</TS></IN>

<BO1> <MI1> <TR>To begin with</TR>, there are few people I know who don't like to attend the school.</MI1> <SI1>They always complain about school, begging for the vacation. Now, by the reason saying they aren't interested in attending school, does it mean they don't have to come to school everyday? I don't think so. Even though they don't like school, in order to gain certain knowledge, basic morality and ability of adaptation in society (Society means the school here), they have to come to school. This one example surely confirms the importance of doing what they may not enjoy.</SI1></BO1> 

<BO2> <MI2> <TR>Also</TR>, people can't live by merely doing what they like.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For example</TR>, if one enjoys playing computer game and only concentrates on playing game, it would result the death in the worst case. Some people might not want to get up in the morning, and they will become so lazy and it will make him or her lethargic. Some might not want to go to work and he or she will lie on the station begging for the money.</EX> Even though the human beings don't like doing arduous toils or things that bothers them, Sometimes it is impossible not to confront with it.</SI2></BO2> 

<CO>With these reasons above, I certainly agree with the above topic.</CO> ",::,4,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"The first body paragraph was more of an example for the thesis, rather than a separate point in itself.",//
"786&Some schools require first-year students to take the same courses, whereas other schools allow students to select the classes they want. Do you agree or disagree?",::,"<IN> <TS>Some people insist that first-year students should take the identical courses in order to acquire prerequisite knowledge. <TR>However</TR>, I wholeheartedly support that schools need to let students select their own classes according to their preference.</TS> The reasons are that they can get wide range of information and have fun.</IN>
 
<BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, students can learn much more and obtain much knowledge by taking classes they want.</MI1> <SI1>Every one has their own interest and curiosity regarding what they want to learn. <TR>Therefor</TR>, they can learn more easily and memorize the contents if they take the class they want. Survey conducted by the Ministry of education in Korea reveals that schools running the policy for taking elective courses in freshman outperforms in grade and satisfaction rate than schools having mandatary courses for first year students. Thus, freedom of choosing classes for students surely improves the knowledge.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2> <MI2> <TR>Moreover</TR>, students can have fun by taking a class they want to take.</MI2> <SI2>They are able to assosiate with their classmates who have same interest and share idears freely. In this process, they can releive accumulated stress and become happier than before. <EX><TR>From my personal experience</TR>, my sister was having a hard time studying at Korean middle school where she listened to the same lectures at school. She felt bored and didn't want to attend school because she didn't pay attention to several subjects she disliked. <TR>However</TR>, when she transfered to US middle school and took classes she chose, she could overcome the boredom and mental disorder. She was indeed having a great time and later on, she could succeedly graduate the school and got the good job.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To summurize</TR>, I belieive that selecting classes is better than having same classes for first year students. The rationale behind this is that students can learn more and get much knowledge. <TR>Also</TR>, by attending the class they want, they may feel happy and enjoy themselves.<TR> All in all</TR>, I think more schools need to have policies for elective classes for their students.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,"The first main point is not very strong, because even classes people don't like will impart knowledge.

787&Successful people prefer to try new things and take risks rather than keep doing what they already do well.,::,"<IN> <TS>Being venturous is really important in success of the enterpreneur. <TR>Likewise</TR>, in order to have a success career or life, one got to be bold. If he or she doesn't take risks and just keep do the conventional things, they wouldn't be able to success.</TS> There are several reasons why I support this idea.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, we have to aware of the fact that successfulness comes from creativity, mostly.</MI1> <SI1>If one keep do what they are already doing well, the position and the salary will gradually get better, but we wouldn't say that is 'Success'. There are already countless people who are good at what they do, successful people are relatively far less. This manifests the truth that venturous people make success. <EX>The late Steve jobs always put a highlight on Innovation, and he suceed. Iphone became one of the most influencial electronic device making company around the world. If Steve jobs was only mimicking other phone company's phones, there wouldn't have been iphone nor other brilliant devices. Even if it wasn't a Steve, there would still be someone else trying new things like touch-phones.</EX> This will eventually lead one to success if he or she has done a hard work on it. Thus, I think the success fundamentally comes from Trying new things.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2> <MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, As I said above, If one is good at conventional thing which everyone else are good at, It won't make any success.<MI2> <SI2>If one does a good job on his work at company just like others, his or her salary might increase and promote, but it will happen gradually. In this situation, we will not be able to call it 'Success' since many others take that step either. Sucessfulness must be differenciated from most of others. If it is just an ordinary thing, we wouldn't even have to call it a 'Success' Taking risk, rather than doing what everyone else is capable of doing, will lead one to ultimate success, if he or she tries the best and littlebit of luck follows. Many CEO has actually declared that they were salarymen and they just tried different things.</SI2></BO2>

788&technology makes children less creative,::,"<IN> <TS>Thought-provoking current issue concerns whether the technology makes children less creative or not. Some people argues that the technology depreciate children's pure imagination while other think the technology is no more than just a technology. <TR>For me</TR>, I think the latter option fits my point. Technology has virtually made people's life more convenient.</TS> .<TR>Moreover</TR>, I think it made children 'more' creative by showing various kinds of devices. There are reasons enumerated below which will prove my idea.</IN>

<BO1> <MI1> <TR>First and the foremost</TR>, I think it's groundless idea to say that technology has made children less creative.</MI1> <SI1>If there weren't any basic technology, there wouldn't be any better technology. <EX>In the primitive ages, we never thought of rocket heading to the space. We couldn't even thought of that before. It is now obvious that there must be some kind of technology, which can bring about the further imagination. <TR>For example</TR>, since human invented car, now we can imagine of flying car, or invisible car and so on.</EX> We can elicit the fact here that there wouldn't be technological imagination if there weren't any prototypes.<TR> In other word</TR>, I think it is proper to say that technology brings another technology.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2> <MI2><TR>As I mentioned above</TR>, I think technology enriched the children's imagination, which opposes the topic.</MI2> 
<SI2><EX>Now in school, teacher may ask his or her children to draw the future life what they think would be. Then, If there weren't any technology, children will draw nothing but the trees and rocks. If they think of cars or robots, they would be extraordinary.</EX> <TR>Therefore</TR>, I think technology even made children's imagination better by providing various things to think of.</SI2></BO2>

789&It is important to give prizes or awards for effort than achievement.,::,"<IN>From schools to companys, most of groups give prizes or awards to their members considering member's achievement.
<TS>Although some people insist that effort is more important than achievement, there are many reaons to these groups.
People can't estimate effort accurately because of its invisibility. So people who make bad use of it will appear.  
<TR>Therefore</TR> I can't but agreeing that an achievement is more important than an effort.</TS></IN>
 <BO1> <MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, we can't see effort.</MI1> <SI1>it means that we can't detect liar. By just saying &quotI tried my best.&quot, he can
make other people believe this although he didn't. In this case achievemnt can powerful to to detect lie. It is not
absolute truth that more effort makes more valuable achievemnt. <TR>However</TR> we can't deny that it is usually true.
If someone who has a common sense and usual intelligence, then he probably agree with this fact. Many groups' rules 
for giving prizes or awards demonstrate it. Without achievement, regardless of how effort is great or not, any 
effort can be evaluated corretly.</SI1></BO1>
 <BO2> <MI2>Because of this weakness of assesmenting, many problems will appear.</MI2> <SI2><EX><TR>For example</TR>, many people may not endeavor. 
people can get prizes easily by just saying &quotI have any achievement but I tried my best!&quot Then, who, fool, will en
deavor eagerly? There is also another problem. If people can get awards easily, then people who have to be rewarded
will increase.</EX> So prizes or awards, probably something physical, money or valuable things, will decrease. 
<TR>Furthermore</TR> these things won't be made quickly because hard endeabors are decrased.</SI2></BO2>
 <CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, giving rewards following people's effort is troublesome because we can't judge degree of effort.
we can't know whether someone really tried best or not. <TR>Furthermore</TR> effort can estimated differently by people. So 
I insist that achievement is more important than effort.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Numerous grammar and semantic issues made it difficult to follow sometimes.  The second main point really encompases both the thesis and the first main point.,//

Of course, It is hard to distinguish between them, however, I strongly believe that relating well with student is a more important factor because relating well with student provides a student with a academic atmosphere and wisdom over the just studies.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, teachers who is relate well with their student is likely to be followed by student.<MI1> <SI1>Such a class not only attracts students to get interesting in their studies,  but also provide a student with academic atmosphere. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, When i was in high school, there was a teachers who liked to hang out with their student.

Schools' requirement of taking same courses will discourage the freshmen's study.  <EX>As a student, I know what is like to learn what I don't want to.

Those who set their goal would choose the courses that can help their goal by themselves. Schools' requirement of same course would interrupt them to follow their goal. <TR>On top of that</TR>, those who did not determine their future career also get setback. If they can take any course they want, they would find what they like and can do well naturally.

Also we can get less stress.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that we are able to become successful.</MI1> <SI1>Large companies like people who work fast. If we can work fast we can ge a good job and be promoted faster. <EX>A really good example can be seen in Steve Jobs.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people who move their home several times might have a fatigue.</MI1> <SI1>When one moves into a new city, the person has to find fine restaurants or a good place to drink and so on.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, moving from one place to another would interrupt people to have a number of close friends.</MI2> <SI2>Deep relationship with friends usually depends on memory or experience they share with. <TR>However</TR>, people who move several times cannot have a sufficient time to share experience with his or her friends. <TR>Accordingly</TR>, that causes weak relationship and the person who is devoid of deep relationship may have a difficulty in having support or relief from others. <TR>Thus</TR>, weak relationship from moving around is more likely to give a negative impact to the person.</SI2> <TR>In this sense</TR>, staying in one place which can make deeper relation is a proper decision for one's mental</BO2>

<BO1><MI1>The first point that I would like to make in supporting my view is that people should help other countries when other countries confront a horrible disaster.</MI1> <SI1>This is because there are possibilities that my country has a similar situation someday. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, the Japan had a terrible disaster tsunami in 2011. <TR>At that time</TR>, my country, the Korea, nearby the Japan, donated a lot of money to the Japan and many Korean went to the Japan to volunteer.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, we are able to know what the customs of its country informatively by checking advertisement.</MI1> <SI1>Advertising customs would be extremely practical and beneficial for generating funds due to the fact that people’s main aim to visit another country is to watch or experience other country’s customs or traditional things. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, England often advertises their famous sports, football.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, using public transportation play a significant role in improving the environment in the future.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that increased use of public transportation can decrease the number of car drivers as well as reduce automobile emissions.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, school uniforms give a sense of uniformity and belonging.</MI1> <SI1>These feelings encourage the students to bond and mingle with peers, and incite active cooperation and collaboration among themselves. <EX>A study on anthropology also showed that students behaved in a disciplined manner and refrained from abominable activities when representing the organization as a whole, and not as an individual.</EX></SI1> I believe that sense of belonging to a group has a positive impact on each student's behavior and social skills, and suppression of ill-doings are necessary.</BO1>

<BO1><MI1>The first point that I would like to make is that the money cannot buy happiness.</MI1> <SI1>Although any person retain lots of money that other people cannot dreamed of, he or she always feel happy. <TR>In addition</TR>, it is easy for people who are overwhelmed by unfavored tasks to feel stress. <TR>After all</TR>, This follow their misfortune. <EX>A study by an employment institute show that almost the half of respondents say that they are regretting to enter a large company now. Moreover, more than 80% of the respondents are under serious stress by excessive tasks.</EX></SI1> This clearly indicates that pursuing only high pay is not a right selection.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason is that people will have a lot of chances to success more if they enjoying their task.</MI2> <SI2>There is a famous saying that a talented person cannot beat a hard-working person and a hard-working person cannot beat a passionate person. That is because the more people enjoy work, the more they feel motivate. This result in their success in their field. My best friend in my university, <EX>Eugene is a good case in point. His major was an economics, but he always attended classes related to cook and food as an elective. He loved cooking food and sometimes invited me to his home and serve food for me. <TR>At first</TR>, his food was horrible. <TR>However</TR>, as time goes by, his cooking ability was appreciably improved and he transferred the department of cooking. <TR>After a few year</TR>, he opened a restaurant and his enterprise was very successful.</EX> <SI2><TR>In this regard</TR>, when selecting a job, people have to consider their preference.</BO2>
 
<CO><TR>All in all</TR>, because of the reasons mentioned above, I firmly believe that happiness is given top priority over any other factor when people choose their jobs.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,The introduction and conclusions do not adequately provide the framework for the essay.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>Society has drastically changed due to a great many of mistakes that human being made. Nowadays, a world is coping with a large number of problems that individuals must solve. <TR>Hence</TR>, people begin to do some tasks as quickly as possible. Individuals do not even have time to take a little bit of rest. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I strongly disagree with them for several grounds.</TR></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, if we only aspire to do something quickly, we might not have fruitful results due to the fact that we would not have time to check and rearrange.</MI1> <SI1><TR>According to the Harvard University</TR>, 80 percent of students prefer to take their time to consider again before doing tasks. What is more, there will be more opportunities to obtain profitable results, if we earnestly do something not cursorily. To be specific, when I was a pupil, I was often admonished by my professor due to hurrying. I always coveted to do homework as quickly as possible. He endeavored me to change my habits and I started doing everything slowly and contemplating.</SI1>This example illuminates that how hurrying is detrimental for individual.</BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, in the event that we only hurry and get things done quickly, we will be extremely indifferent, workaholic and apathetic to other individuals.</MI2> <SI2>Due to the fact that we will not have any time to feel and share any ideas with each other thanks to busy. <TR>Additionally</TR>, there is a famous quote that I really love, ‘“live slowly, think different and love more“. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my brother was extremely busy due to his business. He was intensely exhausted and busy so that he did not house to take a rest and became isolated. I gave priceless advice to him and he started having time and dealing with problems slowly. <TR>Consequently</TR>, everything went very well.</EX></SI2> <TR>Therefore</TR>, this is an illustration which shows that facing the world slowly is really beneficial and practical for people.</BO2>

Although most people of countries such as America, Japan, and Europe do not concern about the lack of the food, there are still many people who desperately want some foods for their lives.

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, nobody can guarantee that endangered animals can continue even if we give some areas for their living.</MI2> <SI2>The most important reason of the animals' extinction is that they cannot adapt the current environment.

<BO1><MI1>The first reason is that people are affected by their friends who they are hanging out with together.</MI1> <SI1>People who have smart friends could increase their intelligence because of friend’s good effects. There are two persons; one has a friend who won first place in class and the other has a friend who is very funny. One year later, there is a big difference in two persons.

"836&In this quickly changing world, people are less happy than they were before.",::,"<IN>In the today's globalized society, it is widely believed that quickly changing world has a negative impact on people compared to the past. Some people advocate that quickly changing society leads people to get stressed. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this point. For the following reasons, I firmly believe that, unlike the past, today's quickly changing world have a positive impact on humans: to widen their perspectives and to improve the economic growth.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, in the present, fast changing society provides people with a wide range of information, making people broaden their horizon.</MI1> <SI1>Having a lot of information exposes people to different worlds of lifestyles, customs, and cultures. Through such experience, people can learn to embrace diversity. It is especially important given that modern society is becoming increasing globalized. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, when I went to a fast-food restaurant with my grand father, there was an Ethiopian girl who brought home-cooked meals. It smelled strange and she ate with her hands without spoon and folk. Although my grand father who didn't adjust to modern society kept his distances from her, I was comfortable with it and became the best friend with her.</EX> This was because I who kept up with modern society had a variety of information and experienced similar situations. <TR>Thus</TR>, this shows that by widen individuals' perspectives, in the present, fast complex society causes people to be happy.</BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, compared to the past society, today's quickly changes have a bigger contribution to the economic growth.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that with development of technology, such as cell phones, cars, and computers, many business took place and formed diverse fields. This trend has been continually creating millions of job opening. <EX><TR>For example</EX>, according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Labor of Korea in 2000, it revealed that after the car boom in the markets in the 1980s, the number of job positions had increased. The study indicated that the rise of middle class stimulated people spend more, which played a significant role in improving Korea's economic boost.</EX></SI2> <TR>Therefore</TR>, this proves that the economic growth is improved by quickly changing world unlike the past.</BO2>
 
<CO><TR>In conclusion</TR>, in the present, the advantages of quickly changing world far weight its dis advantages.

"837&More and more centre-town stores are replaced by out-of-town big stores. As a result, more and more people have to buy cars in order to get to those 'far away' stores.",::,"<IN>The survey conducted by Princeton University research team shows that one of the most innovative change about shopping culture is 'Wal-mart.' It is a big change from centre-town small store to suburban big one. As it is usually located in the suburban area, people have to drive a car so as to get goods. It makes some people complain, as they should spend more time to buy products. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I firmly believe that these out-of-town big stores beget lots of advantages, and my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people can get same goods with cheaper price.</MI1> <SI1><TR>Moreover</TR>, as products provided by big stores are much cheaper than centre-small stores, this opportunity usually offsets losses caused by driving a car. It is because out-of-town big stores achieve 'economy of scales.' This term means that the more they offer products to customers, the more average selling costs decrease. Because stores located in outside of town are big enough to accommodate lots of products and provide them to many customers, the chance of making profits is higher than small-medium sized stores. <EX><TR>In my case</TR>, I sometimes need to buy a T-shirt. When I visit the Wal-mart, I can compare a wide range of T-shirts displayed at the floor and get with cheaper price, which is not possible in centre-town stores, since they just show small number of products with high price.</EX></SI1> From the customers' point of view, it is a desirable change.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, people can experience new services and convenience when they go to a out-of-town big store.</MI2> <SI2>Many huge marts offer various services, from big parking lots and shuttle bus to rest areas and children playing field. Going shopping is not just buying a product, but experiencing a new culture. <TR>Consequently</TR>, one sociologist refer to this phenomenon as the new shopping of modern generation. <EX><TR>According to a survey by a London School of Economics faculty</TR>, more than 89% interviewed answered that they enjoy going to malls with family member, as there are lots of cultural experiences and chances for socializing with neighbors.</EX></SI2> <TR>From this result</TR>, we have a reasonable evidence to support suburban shopping centers.</BO2>

<BO1><MI1>The main reason for my feeling this way is associated with the fact that the most of the old have their many experiences acquired by failure and success.</MI1> <SI1>They may worry about their job and vision and marriage and so on and thus have a better choice about these.

"849&Many people have a close relationship with their pets. These people treat their birds, cats, or other animals as members of their family. In your opinion, are such relationships good? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ",::,"<IN><TR>Recently</TR>, we can see many people taking their beloved pets around the town with cute clothes on and many pretty accessories. It seems that those pet owners do not care how much money and time are spent to care for pets. I say this is a quite unusual phenomenon for people today because we are becoming more self-centered and indivisualistic. So, for me, treating birds, dogs or other animals as members of one's family is wonderful and I have some more specific reasons for that. <TS>Considering them as a family, one can learn how to care and love others, and sometimes the feeling of solitary can be tolerated easily.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, I suggest that we can practise loving other people as we care for pets.</MI1> <SI1>It is a universal thought that to love does not need practice and it is very intuitive. <TR>However</TR>, one theory about love revealed that loving also requires a lot of practice in order to give affection successfully. <TR>Thus</TR>, if we live with a pet in a house and feed it with great love we would become more intimate at liking somebody. I think this quality is necessary especially for the Korean (and I am Korean) because we are not very good at expressing ourselves frankly due to historical background. Expressing one's feeling is so important that if if is not showed it can cause a big misunderstanding between persons.</SI1> <TR>Therefore</TR>, once more I insist that taking care of pets is good and we can get an advantage from it. </BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Another benefic of keeping close relationships with animals is that helps us overcome the loneliness which is very prevalent among contemporary people.</MI2> <SI2><TR>For the example of Korea</TR>, the number of extended family decreased and that of nuclear family is still increasing. The charateristic of a nuclear familiy is that there is not many members in a familiy and being home alone is very common. Wheras human is a social animal, the trend makes him/her work or spend time alone.</SI2> When that happens, having a company is really enjoyable and pets can take that spot instead of a busy human. </BO2>

<CO><TR>Lastly</TR>, I'd like to restate that being close to animals can bring us a lot of advantages even though I only mentioned two of them. <Tr>Besides that</TR>, we are also able to learn the importance of life by raising pets and nursing them when they are illed. Now, we are in an individualistic sociciety and the one of posssible ways of detering it is maintaing a good relationship with animals.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,There was some word choice and style shortfalls in this essay which kept the content from being easy to understand. ,//

<BO1><MI1>One of the biggest advantages of a factory is the employment opportunity that it can bring.</MI1> <SI1>A large factory needs lots of workers, so many people in the community can obtain jobs. <TR>Furthermore</TR> this high employment opportunity will encourage people from other communities to move in.</SI1> <TR>As a result</TR>, it will boost our community's economy by allowing other industries such as retail stores, restaurants, automotive shops to flourish as well. </BO1>

852&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor (boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important. ,::,"<IN>As the competition between firms is getting severer, the role of boss becomes more important in the aspect of survival and success of each firm. Boss can make a success by his decisiveness, or screw up a good project by rashness, either. <TR>At that level</TR>, qualities of boss is really crucial in the success of each firm. <TR>So</TR>, there have been many proposals on what is important qualities of a good boss. <TS><TR>Now</TR>, let me enumerate these qualities one by one.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>Firstly</TR>, a good boss must have responsibility toward his men.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In my opinion</TR>, responsibility toward his members is the virtue of a good boss that can’t be overemphasized. <EX>Here is hypothetical example.

The consulting firm without boss rushed into bankruptcy because of losing confidence in the market,. Members didn’t only lose the opportunity of getting lessons from hardship, but also had to move their job in a haste without deep thought. All clients and members of the firm now never consider him as a good boss. Because they realized that capacity without responsibility can bear the disappointment and hatred in the long run.</EX> </SI11></BO1>
<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, Decisiveness can be one of important qualities of a good boss.</MI2> <SI2>Boss is at the top of decision making process.

<CO><TR>To sum up</TR>, I’ve selected responsibility and decisiveness as important qualities of a good boss. I admit that there can be much more qualities of a good boss than these two. But these two are really basic qualities that boss must have, in comparison with other qualities such as honesty, promptness, and affinity. These two are basic in that these can make boss different from others.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, older people have a better understanding of life and can appreciate it better.</MI1> <SI1>We can see a surprising number of young people who do not know what they are capable of doing with their lives, while on the other hand, older people have better insight to life. The old people would have experienced the ups and downs of life, the joys and sorrows, the success and adversities at certain points in their life. While the younger people have a lot left to worry in their lives; their education, work, marriage, house and children, the older people have already experienced this.</SI1>The insight, wisdom and experience gained from life is invaluable, and through this, the older people can appreciate life and live it to the fullest.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, the older people have the time and/or money to enjoy their lives.</MI2> <SI2>Though some may say that they do not have enough energy comparable to that of youth, there are a myriad of ways to enjoy life. <EX>My mentor who is now in his sixties told me the story of his life once. He was regarded very successful in his days, someone of intellect and wealth, who anyone would envy and aspire to be. He graduated from a prestigious university, he was a holder of a PhD, he had worked as an executive of a renown multinational firm, then later established a company of his own, which turned out to be lucrative, and had retired soon. I always expected him to tell me that his successful achievements as a youth was something anyone should follow. But to my surprise, he once revealed to me that he enjoyed his later stages of life much more than his youth. He said it was not the money nor the youth that he enjoyed, but had greater satisfaction from the time he got to spend for himself and his family and the sight of his grandchildren.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, Advise is not fully enough.</MI1> <SI1>Adviser can't give a lesson to a specific item. Even if I accept advice, I have to apply it to adapt my situation.

If faces a dilemma, because both goals, protecting cultural diversity and saving financial resources, are important. How can government deal with this problem?</IN>

<BO1><MI1><Supporting financial resource to prevent rare languages from disappearing has a big advantage to society, as people can find out many traditional values from languages.</MI1> <SI1>By studying extinguishing language, which is the product of cultural tradition accumulation, such as songs, poets and novels, government can enrich the society's culture. <TR>Moreover</TR>, diversifying cultures can be transferred to the future generation, which will be helpful to the human history, as they can learn from many lessons written and spoken in these languages.</SI1> <TR>Thus</TR>, the associated costs of supporting rare languages have many merits from a cultural point of view.</BO1>

<CO>In this circumstance, the word 'balance' really makes sense.

<BO1><MI1>The first reason for my choice is that there is approprite time in doing all behavior.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, though a decision is very correct, the decision is meaningless when people lose the chance to behave because of long time for decision. <TR>Rather than that</TR>, though the decision is a little late, not to lose the chance to behave is more reasonalbe than not.</SI1></BO1>

However, which is more important between them? <TS><TR>In my opinion</TR>, conveying knowledge to students is much more crucial than getting along with them. This is because the primary role of a teacher is to give academic knowledge and teachers can be biased on evaluation if they have deep relationships with students.</TS></IN>

  <BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the most fundamental reason why schools exist is because they have responsibilities to make students educated.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, students enroll school because they want to learn something valuable for their future. Although teachers might not be friendly, it is fine for students to obtain knowledge if the teachers give well their lecture. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I took the introductory course of mathematical analysis in university.

  <BO2><MI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, when it comes to evaluation, teachers can have a subjective judgement on students if they are related well with students.</MI2> <SI2>In order to have a fair assessment, teachers should not have prejudice or bias on their students. <TR>However</TR>, it is very hard to follow the guideline once they have affection or disgust to students. <TR>For instance</TR>, a 2012 report conducted by the Ministry of Education in Korea shows that the more popular teachers are to students, the more generous grades students get from the teachers.

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the history is the origin of every academic element.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, every area of academy, science, music, art, to names a few, has its own history.

People want to meet a good neighborhood or be a good neighborhood. <TR>However</TR>, different people have different standards about good neighbor. <TS>For me, I would say that the most important qualities of good neighbors are consideration for others and credibility.</TS></IN>

Some might suggest that even busy parents should spend their time with their children. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>contrary to such belief</TR>, I strongly argue that it is beneficial for parents to use their rest time for their needs.</TS> In this essay, I will be discussing two reasons for opinion.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, as human relationships are getting more complex, it is not easy for them to devote to their children.</MI1> <SI1><TR>As you may know</TR>, in stories of books and movies in the past, people divided into two groups: bad ones and good ones. <TR>However</TR>, as time goes by, friend can become enemies and enemies can become co-workers. This is a result of having relationships with a number of people. <TR>In addition</TR>, in the past, while they were responsible only for their family and themselves, many people are now members of communities, managers who have many subordinates, and the presidents of hobby club. In order to maintain social relationships, which are extremely necessary in human-network-oriented society, they spend rest time on meeting a variety of people in place of taking care of their children. If we use these relationships well, we can succeed. Otherwise we become losers.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, my another reason has to do with stress.</MI2> <SI2>With more and more people focus on improving their quality of life, reducing stress is a must. In this situation, spending time at one`s disposal would be optimal for reliving stress. <EX><TR>To illustrate this point</TR>, when I worked in demand company, I always was swamped with heavy workload. <TR>However</TR>, since I could enjoy my hobby such as climbing lofty mountains and interacting with my friends whenever I got a little leisure time, I did not need to worry about how to play and where is the best place for travel to satisfy with my son.</EX></SI2></BO2>

<BO3><MI3><TR>On top of that</TR>, my first reasons has to do with stress.</MI3> <SI3>with more and more people focus on improving their life of quality, reducing stress is a must. <TR>In this situation</TR>, relieving stress would be optimal for their life. To illustrate this point, Korean research shows that a lot of father who have  demanding job are stressful because even their free time should be used for their family. In addition more than 80 percentage people think that it is enough for them to spend with their children ordinary life, which means eating dinner or before sleeping.</SI3></BO3>

<CO><TR>In a nutshell</TR>, despite spending all the time with their children has some advantages, <TR>from my personal opinion</TR>, I strongly believe that they should have time with what meeting their desire.

916&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Famous athletes and entertainers deserve the million-dollar salaries they earn.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it is hard for famous celebrities and sport players to keep their own privacy.</MI1> <SI1>Since they are famous and well-known, it is not easy for them to go outside and do whatever they want to do since their fans are looking at them. <TR>Plus</TR>, these days people quickly find out where the famous movie star is or what he or she is doing right now by tweeter and facebook. <TR>As a result</TR>, the celebrities and famous athletes often find the place where they can have their private space that cost much higher than any regular places. <TR>In this manner</TR>, they spends much money on any activities that they do outside. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, according to one article about one famous figure skating star, Yuna Kim, she replied that she has spent much money after she won the gold medal in 2010 Vancouver Olyimpics and became famous. When she was in one restaurant, many people noticed her and kept asking for signature and pictures while eating. After this event, she starts finding places that not many people visit. She continues saying that these places usually cost much higher than any other places.</EX> Not only Yuna Kim, but many other famous ones deserve to earn much money as they spend much money than common people.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, many celebrities or famous sport players invest on themselves.</MI2> <SI2>As they are well-known, they need to prepare and keep improving their ability or skills on whatever they do. <TR>In this way</TR>, they often spent more time on their practice and spent more money as well for the equipment or clothing. One city in South Korea has the most popular and famous baseball team, Lotte Giants. Many players start gathering for practice 6 hours before the actual game starts.They pay their own money to buy all things that they need for practice and game.<TR>Plus</TR>, most of those are expensive to buy. <TR>In this situation</TR>, even if they buy only the essential ones that they need, they get to spend lots money.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>Both famous entertainers and sport players deserve to earn high salaries, because they need it.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, lower possessions restrict participaton of various activities.</MI1> <SI1>In today's world, most of sports amatuers do or hobbies people do is connected to using pretty much money like going to amusementpark or golf. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, one of my friends(가정형편이좋지않는)can't get along with me and other friends when we go to movie or eat out in restaurant. he looks pitty,not happy.

The answer to this question can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, the jury may still be out, <TR>but as far as I am concerned</TR>, I agree with the statement.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows.</IN>
 
 <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, playing games will be beneficial for adults to deal with their stress.</MI1> <SI1>It could not be saying that grown-ups, who have a myriad of responsibilities, obtain more stress than children but, it is absolutely true that modern world’s adults get a large amount of stress from their business as well as social connections.<TR> In this sense</TR>, games could be a useful method to relieve stress efficiently. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my grandfather is an excellent chess player and one of his major hobbies is playing chess with his acquaintances. He used to work at a financial company and I remember that he sometimes fed up with his work since it gave him a lot of stress. <TR>However</TR>, he knew how to handle his stress and the way was playing chess with his friends. After playing chess, he felt fresh and recharged his energy to go back his work.</EX> <TR>In this regard</TR>, playing games for senior would be helpful because it gives them a mean to handle their stress.</SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, due to dramatically improved technology, games provide adults a way to accomplish their unachieved dreams.</MI2> <SI2>Human beings are able to do things; those are certainly believed to be impractical or only imaginable in the past, owing to wonderfully progressive science and technology. Especially in computer and video game fields, there come new materials assisting people to experience completely different lives from their real ones. <TR>For instance</TR>, a project under development by a game firm is planning to supply opportunities to try a whole new life for players in a web-based virtual world. The project is well anticipated especially by grown-ups since many of them have already chosen many things in their lives and they expect to be able to start again their lives even if it is in a virtual world. They believe that this sort of game could be a kind of compensation for things that they could not have chosen. <TR>In this sense</TR>, games would be a chance to live another life which they could not have selected.</SI2></BO2>
 
<CO> <TR>In conclusion</TR>, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of two reasons mentioned above. <TR>Once again</TR>, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoints of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim.</CO>",::,5,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"Your thesis statement is quite weak, but the rest of the essay is very strong.

&quotIt is better to focus on one project at a time and then start another one.&quot",::,"<IN>Some people believe that it is better to implement various projects at the same time. <TS><TR>However</TR>, <TR>In my opinion</TR>, focusing on one project is more effective, because this make it possible to improve the quality of the project, and save times.</TS></IN>
    
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, by concentrating on one project, I can improve its quality and completeness.</MI1> <SI1>This way allows me to approach to my assignment with in-depth understanding. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I've been assigned many projects, I worried about my assignments.

921&Having a job that pays a low salary but is secure is better than a job that pays a high salary but is easy to lose.,::,"<IN>It is evident in our current society work has a tremendous importance in our lives. Some people think that having a job that pays a high salary but is easy to lose is better than a job that pays a low salary but is secure while others do not. <TS>I <TR>however</TR>, believe that a job that pays a low salary but is secure is better.</TS> There are several reasons that I could discuss to support my argument so I will limit my discussion to the two that I feel are the most relevant to the topic. First, people receive stress. Also, it is efficient.</IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that people can receive too much stress.</MI1> <SI1>Commonly in society, people tend to be stressed out. If people got a job which is easy to lose, they would receive too much stress which can cause anxiety issues. A recent news report I watched on the Sejong Daily revealed some interesting findings. According to the report, a surprising number of employees at Samsung Electronics claimed that they were sick because they received too much stress. <EX>Just last year, my brother could not sleep for 2 weeks because he was too stressed out from anxiety about fire.</EX> As this outcome shows, having a job that pays a high salary but is easy to lose does not help because it will add too much stress. This brings me to my next argument which is mentioned in the paragraph below.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>Also</TR>, another reason for my thinking this way is that it is more efficient to have a secure job.</MI2> <SI2>Managing time is very important in our lives. <TR>Thus</TR>, it can be said that it is better for people to have a secure job though it pays low salary. <EX>A really good example can be seen in Steve Jobs. I read online that Jobs, the former CEO of Apple Company, transformed his company into one of the most profitable information technology enterprises in the world because he had the secure job and he was able to save time. During one of his interviews Jobs said that he was able to do this because he had not pursued money, but security. This helped him learn how to use his precious time.</EX> This example clearly shows that having a job that pays a low but is secure is efficient for people.</SI2></BO2>

"922&It has been said, &quotNot everything that is learned is contained in books.&quot Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?",::,"<CO>We are living in the age of knowledge society. It means that nothing is more important for a better life than learning knowledge. <TR>Thus</TR>, one famous philosopher  said, 'Knowledge is a power.' There are two kinds of knowledge, one is experienced knowledge and the other is codified knowledge. Although both of them are crucial to our life, we have to investigate them more and deeper, discriminating which are more important to us. By doing so, people can live a wise life.</CO>

<IN>Knowledge gained from experience and one gained from books have a common background. It is that they are good resources for a better life. As a medium to learn much knowledge and wisdom, both experience and books are necessary and people have to cherish them. If humans had not got useful know-hows from them, they would not have been differentiated from animals. <TR>Consequently</TR>, it is right to argue that people should not neglect either of them. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I personally think knowledge from books is more important than knowledge from experience.</TS> This is especially true in this fast changing modern society. There are primary two reason why books are more significant.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, knowledge codified in books is easier to learn and to be delivered from person to person.</MI1> <SI1>It is because books are more likely to be preserved for a long time without change. All things that people have to know for learning from books are just to know language. If people are familiar with language, then they can learn many things from books without any obstacle, transcending time and space. <TR>In addition</TR>, it helps people give their knowledge to other people easily. According to a study conducted by Yale research team, those which were learned through books by surveyed students are more likely to be understood and memorized easier. The result shows that the sphere of students' brain which is highly related to understanding and memorizing are more active when they learn from books than any other materials.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2<MI2><TR>Second</TR>, books give people more opportunity to learn various things.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In other words</TR>, people are able to know what they have not experienced, which is a fascinating fact to our life. As the society changes rapidly, it is almost impossible to experience everything that happens in our life. Books can be a supplement to this lack of experience. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I want to know about many nations, particularly Japan. <TR>However</TR>, I cannot go there due to high costs and time. Reading books provide me with not only a chance of indirect experience, but also much knowledge about Japan. Even though I have not visited there, I know much about Japanese life style, geography, and culture.</EX> This is why I firmly argue that knowledge from books are really important to our life.</SI2></BO2>",::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,"This is a really excellent essay, it is just out of order.

923&The government’s priority should be the natural environment than economic development.,::,"<IN>Since past decades, there have been acute conflicts about the government's priority between the environmental issues and economic growth. <TS>Although I admit that both argues have rational points, the government should be more inclined to economic development over environmental protection. This is because the well-being of a person starts from not being hunger and some environmental issues can be solved by cooperating with other countries.</TS></IN>

 <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, since people cannot talk about well-being such as the natural environment if they are starving, the government should make an effort for feeding them first.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, in this world, there are so many people who spend hard time in getting a job and cannot make enough money for living. I think campaigns for environmental protections are useless for them. The government which represents its citizen has responsibilities for taking care of them, so actions for the economic growth should be done first over those for other additional issues. According to a 2012 report conducted by World Health Organization, more than one fifth of population in Somalia in Africa suffer from hunger and one third of them are situated in a seriously hazardous condition. In these conditions, can the government praise the words like saving nature or protecting animals?</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of the statement above</TR>, issues related to the natural environment are not limited to domestic problems but international ones and, as a result, a government's efforts may be useless.</MI2> <SI2>Sometimes a nation's efforts for the some environmental issues are too insignificant to contribute to solving the problems. <TR>For instance</TR>, think about the global warming. Due to some countries which have released so much greenhouse gases, the world's temperature is going up consistently. <TR>However</TR>, it is hard for a government to handle this problem because the contribution that a country makes gases to the world is relatively small. This kind of problems should be handled by cooperating with other many nations together. <TR>Therefore</TR>, I think that the government had better focus on its national economic issues than on environmental ones.</SI2></BO2>

  <CO><TR>In sum</TR>, I think that the government should pay attention more on its economic development than on natural environment because issues related to economy are more indispensable and some environmental issues cannot be solve by a nation's efforts.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,"Your essay is all right, but I think you could argue this point a little better.

924&Cars have had a greater effect on society than planes have.,::,"<IN>It is often said that the invention of cars plays a tremendous role in society. <TS>Although I agree many benefits that cars brought us, I think that the planes are more influential on society. This is because planes have reduced time spent on traveling and have become possible to expand business areas.</TS></IN>

 <BO1> <MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, people don't have to spend much time on traveling since planes become commercialized.</MI1> <SI1>Before planes are not common like today, people had to use transportation such as trains, cars, or ships. Since the speed of them was too slow, people who wanted or had to make a trip needed to endure a long and boring time only for the traveling. <TR>However</TR>, after the planes, people have become to reach everywhere with short time. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, my grandmother whose parents immigrated to Europe with a ship from Korea when she was a baby. She always wanted to go back her hometown someday but it was nearly impossible for her because it was too far when she was young. <TR>However</TR>, after planes become popular, she decided to go abroad and took a plane which destination was her hometown. It took just nine hours, arrived there, and her dreams came true.</EX> If planes had not been invented, she would not have been able to visit the country.</SI1></BO1>

  <BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly</TR>, planes have allowed business areas to be extended.</MI2> <SI2>Since globalization emerged out, many international companies have been able to penetrate a daily life of people living in other countries. I think that planes have great contribution to this kind of phenomenon. <TR>For instance</TR>, think about the Starbucks coffee shop. The coffee shop was founded in a city in U.S.A. but now people can find them almost everywhere in the world. This became possible because not only materials and goods needed for managing the shops conveyed over planes but also administrators in the headquarter can easily control the regional shops by detaching some employees to the regions or vice versa. <TR>Therefore</TR>. planes made companies manage their oversee regional office easily and efficiently.</SI2></BO2>

   <CO> <TR>In summary</TR>, I think that planes have superior points over cars when it comes to influences on society. This is largely because they decrease the time for traveling to other places and also they allow many companies to enlarge their business to the world.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,An excellent essay!

925& It is important to know about world issue even when they are not directly related to your own life,::,"<IN>Some people might say that it is useless to know world news when they are not related to their daily life. <TS><TR>However</TR> I personally believe the most important for people is to acknowledge what is going on not only around them but also the global issues, by following two reasons, first reason is everything occurs in this world is related to each other. The second reason is the knowledge about global issues could be used in future.</TS></IN>
 
 <BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, every event occurring in the earth is related to each other even though they don’t seem to be at first.</MI1> <SI1>In these days people don’t mind what happened on the opposite side of the earth because they are so small that they don’t seem to be affect their lives. <TR>However</TR> after years later they regret what they had done years ago because the event has big effect on their routine lives. <TR>To clarify</TR>, I read from science magazine that wind from one flapping of small butterfly can be result of serious hurricane to another country. <TR>In conclusion</TR>, the starting point of event might be look small but it could bring harsh result. So it is better for people to know what happened outside of country and prepare for the result.</SI1></BO1>
 
 <BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, as people doesn’t know which knowledge they will be needed in future, it will be helpful for people to know world issues.</MI2> <SI2>In recent days, as the business gets bigger and transportation technology, such as plane, gets more develop people go business trip to another country for days or week more often. <EX>I heard personal experience about business trip from my cousin who works at business company. He went to Japan for important contract and he succeeded because he read newspapaer on what apparatus the Japan company made a year ago and how the apparatus used in my country also how to use in the future.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
 <CO><TR>In summary</TR>, it is advantageous for people to know global issues because all issues are connected also interacting each other Also as future is not certain, knowing global events will be advantageous to people.

<BO1> <MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, many additives are contained in  the processed foods or ready-made ingredients.</MI1> <SI1>When factories process foods to make it easy to cook at home, they add chemicals such as preserve, artificial flavor and color for their profits. <TR>However</TR>, these chemicals can cause the problems by confusing hormone balance in our bodies. According to the National Health department in Korea, many children have diseases based unbalanced hormone from headache and digestion problem to unrecoverable  defects on their organs such as cancers by exposing many chemicals in foods. Thus using prepared foods is not a good choice for health.</SI1></BO1>

 <BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, the process of factories manufacturing foods is hard to trust.</MI2> <SI2>Factories work just for their profits and produce a lot of amount of products in a short time, so they use cheep ingredients for food products and sometimes they fail to maintain proper level in hygiene. Especially, in the summer, epidemics of digestive disease evoked by eating rotten foods or contaminated foods is easy to happen national wide because the hygiene problems in the process of foods in factories effects to many people who using it. <TR>For this reason</TR>, government call upon manufacturers to obtain the standard of hygiene but form time to time it is not observed for their profits. <TR>Therefore</TR>, our health can be harmed by using manufactured foods for company's immorality.</SI2></BO2>

928&Some peopel say that success is the most important thing; do you agree or disagree that it is more important to remain in happy and optimistic when you fail,::,"<IN>Opinions might be divided over whether it is more important to remain happy and positive when we can't reach the achievement. People from different walks of life may take different stances on this issue. 
<TS><TR>Personally</TR>, I believe that having an optimistic mind in the case of the fail is more crucial, and there are two reasons that could validate my position.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1>The first point that I would like to make in supporting my view is that the positive thinking would be the foundation of success.</MI1>
<SI1>We aren't able to make a hit every time, so if we did not give up readily we can obtain success consistently. 
<EX>Let's take my experience as an example, in my high school; MATH was the real problem to get a good grade.
How hard I tried, getting a satisfied score was not an easy subject to me.
But I had a patient to study without the halt, so finally I could make a perfect score in MATH.
<TR>Consequently</TR>, even those efforts were useful in my university.</EX>
<TR>In this regard</TR>, if we persuaded our goals with the positive mind, the success will be on your way constantly.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason that should be taken into account is that it will reduce mental stress.</MI2>
<SI2>When we cannot make a success, the anger and sorrow initiated by the failure will give negative effects on our psychological statue.
By accepting the unwilling results with having the optimistic mind, the results will be the thing of the past because we are able to overcome the failure.
<TR>As shown in the above</TR>, having a positive mental statue is beneficial for protecting us from sorrow and anger.</SI2></BO2>

Universities should spend as much money on sports as they do in libraries.",::,"<IN>Some people argue that universities should spend much money on sports like they do on libraries.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, spending money on sports facilities will interrupt students to study.</MI1> <SI1>If sports facilities are set up in every place in campus, campus will be filled with a lot of noises playing sports. Students are already busy doing their study, but if this happens, students will have difficulty in studying. <EX><TR>In my case</TR>, there is a soccer field in front of a library in my university, and students who study there always complain about the noise from the soccer field.</EX> This example shows how it will be ineffective for school to spend money on sports. School should encourage student to study, not let them make noise playing sports. <TR>In other words</TR>, universities should not invest much money in sport.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, rather than spending money on sports, it is more efficient to keep investing in library.</MI2> <SI2>This is because the better libraries’ facilities are, the more efficient for students to study. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, a library in my school was very old and small. <TR>As a result</TR>, most students were reluctant to come to the library, because there was no space to study. <TR>Moreover</TR>, some desks or chair were broken, so it was almost impossible to study in the library.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, even though people's effort to make better plans to cope with every kinds of risk, unexpected problems always could be existed.</MI1> <SI1>This is because today's society is too complex to make perfect plans, and in these situations, these unexpected problems can be controled more flexibly by working creatively. <TR>For example</TR>, I can give a example of stock market.

933&People should carefully plan activities for their free time. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>When people are given free time in the midst of the work, they usually chat with friends or surf the internet meaninglessly. I strongly believe that this is just because they don't know how to use their free time well. <TS><TR>In this sense</TR>, I totally agree with the statement that people should carefully plan activities for their free time for two reasons: One is that the free time would be beneficial if people plan activities considerably, and the other is that it would be a practice for people to make a plan of their the future.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, making a plan for their own free time would help people to spend the time useful.</MI1> <SI1>People can use their free time  not only for meaningless chatting or surfing, but doing what they really want to do. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, I always wanted to learn to play a drum. <TR>However</TR>, I always believed that there is not enough time to learn how to play drum. <TR>Actually</TR>, I was spending my free time every 2 hours a day in my home doing nothing. After realizing this wasteful time, I gathered it altogether and began to spend it playing drum. It made me possible to change meaningless time to useful time that became my favorite.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, planning a schedule for free time can be a practice of making a plan for the future.</MI2> <SI2>This is because both planning a free time and future have in common that they are planning for the time use. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I recently tried to make a plan for my free time. I used my free time to play a drum, to watch movie I wanted to, and to make new friends. <TR>Nowadays</TR>, I feel it increased my ability to make a plan for the future. <TR>Until recently</TR>, I did not have any exact plan for the future because it seemed hard to make a plan. <TR>In contrast</TR>, after making a schedule of my free time, I planned to study patent law in the future.

a sense of creative have a bigger contribution to society. <TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this point. <TS>For the following reasons, I firmly believe that people with being planning carefully result
in the best solution than those with being creative: to increase academic perform and to succeed in career.</TS>
<MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, living with planning carefully encourages students to perform with more entusiasm, which makes a good suggestion.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact when students carefully plan their school life,
they can have a lot of information. having much information is one of the key motivators for children to perform and improve themselves. With such motivation, they will put in more effort,
concentrate better on their tasks, and feel responsible for their work. <TR>For example</TR>, accordint to a study done by the Ministry of Education of Korea in 2012, it revealed that there was
a huge difference between two groups of students in achievement. The study indicated that students in Group A planned their school life well and those in Gruop B lived in camplus freely.
<TR>Interestingly</TR>, the former group spent more hours studying by 50 percent and performed higher than the latter group. <TR>Moreover</TR>, students in gruop A followed instructions, submitted their
assignments, and participated actively in class. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, those in Group B lazed off in class and lacked focus on class materials. <TR>Thus</TR>, this shows that planning life allows students
to increase their academic performance.</SI1>
<MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, by making the best solution, being planning carefully play a significant role in success in career.</MI2> <SI2>This is attributed to the fact that people who live planning life make a good
suggestion, leading the growth of a company. <TR>Moreover</TR>, as modern society is becoming increasingly complex, the today's job markets require people wich such qualities. <TR>For example</TR>, according
to a study conducted by the New York Times in 2011, it revealed that the employee interview is the most important conponent in hiring practice, taking up more than 70 percent in the final

940&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should try several different jobs before getting a long-term job. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.,::,"<IN>Many seniors in college are trying best to have a good job. Some are seeking a long-term job while others are searching for a temporary one. Many people think that trying several different jobs before getting a long-term job is a must, as they can avoid regrets of taking an unsatisfactory job by doing so. <TS><TR>However</TR>, I disagree with this argument and firmly believe that people had better take one long-term job from the start.</TR> My view can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, job-seeker can give a bad signal to employers who are looking for sincere and loyal employees.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, trying several different jobs can be understood that they are not loyal to one specific company, and they can leave if they are not satisfied with their job. This is what employers really hate. According to a study conducted by Harvard Business School research team, about 85% of Fortune 500 corporations' HR managers are more likely to favor those who are loyal to their company, even though they can be somewhat disqualified for company's requirement. Managers believe that it is no problem if employees stick to their position and pursue what they really want to do for the company. By doing so, they can boost their long-term productivity themselves and raising profits for company as well. <TR>In addition</TR>, employers are afraid that their labor will go another rival company, which is harmful for company. From this survey, we can conclude that having a long-term job at the firsthand is a better option to succeed in our life.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, people can experience other several works before taking a real job.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it in another way</TR>, participating in an internship program or having a part-time job are good chances to pre-experience what kinds of interests they have. Attending internships provided by many corporations in college life can give students what duties they have to do, and it will help them what they really like to do for their life.

The result came out, group which done study group was twice higher than the other group. By working with same level people, people come up with better results because they can easily find what troubles helper and how to solve efficiently.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, as students or coworkers understand each other and help each other they might be close to each other In other word, it is more easy to ask each other how to solve certain problem.</MI2> <SI2><TR>In fact</TR>, most people not prefer to ask question to their teachers or advisers because, not only they are not familiar with their professors or superiors but also they don’t want to show weakness to their superiors. As I wrote in the first paragraph, it found out that students in second groups didn’t asked professor a question on the topic because it was hard to speak with professor during and after his class for discomfortness. <TR>In contrast</TR>, the first group of students, asked questions each other actively and knew the topic better. <TR>In conclusion</TR>, people feel familiar with their friends or same level people because same level people are more easier to approach and easier to be friend.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up with</TR>, it found out that people working with same level co-workers can get better results because they have same viewpoint which makes easier to help each other and they can ask more about problem easier to same level people than their superiors. <TR>For these reasons</TR>, I disagree with the statement that leaner can learn better from their superiors than their same levels.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,"Your essay is pretty good.

"954&Many people have a close relationship with their pets. These people treat their brids, cats, or other animals as members of their family. In your opinion, are such relationship good? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.",::,"<IN>Increasing number of people have adopted pets as members of the family. <TS>While some people are against accepting animals as a true friend and a family member, I strongly feel that having close relationship with pets is advisable. Pets can not only be a true friend, but can teach you the value of life.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, pets can become a true friend that you can share and cherish many moments of life.</MI1> <SI1>Animals have feelings and intelligence of their own and respond to people in variety of ways. <EX>I still remember the day my parents brought home a Pomeranian puppy. My sister an I were fascinated by the little ball of fur and we were always eager to spend time with her. I spent my childhood watching her grow and for the next 13 years, she was more than a pet to me. She was the one to welcome me when I got home and she was the one to patiently listen to all my little secrets. Though she succumbed to senility almost 7 years ago, I still cherish the moments I spent with her and miss her dearly.</EX>
While some dissent that pets cannot replace a family member, I strongly believe that pets can be the friend when you need someone to be by your side.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, pets can teach you the value of life.</MI2> <SI2>Many believe that human beings are far superior to animals, and it is not uncommon to hear news of ghastly animal abuse and cruelty. Every time I come across such news, I get a feeling that those abusers, given a chance, would do the same to human beings. Experts have discovered that there is strong correlation between the way you treat animals to the way you treat other people. This underpins that people who build healthy relationship with their pets are likely to have good rapport with their peers. I believe that owning pets teaches the owner how to take care of other living creatures, appreciate non-violence, and become a compassionate person. I am confident that many pet owners would appreciate life better than pet abusers.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>All in all</TR>, being a pet owner myself, I believe that having good relationship with pets far outweigh the potential disadvantages.

  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, a national security is one of services that the government offers, and its existence is directly associated to the wellbeing of people.</MI1> <SI1>If there were no army or weapons to defense a nation's security, its people would be exposed to a danger of being threatened by other countries.

956&All university students should take basic science courses even when they are not planning on going into the field of science,::,"<IN>I believe that science is the most important subject that every scholar needs them as underlying of their field.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, choosing courses of university is focused on student’s interests, not university’s mandatory rule.</MI1> <SI1>All students have an opportunity to learn basic science knowledge during their second school time.  After graduation of second school, students go the university to teach them specific and special field what they really interest.  Even though they are not too long to be independent, but they are grown up adults, so they have a right to do choose or deny the course upon their interest.  <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I paid by myself for my college tuition. I am working twelve hours per three days a week and this is just because of my tuition. I do not want to take basic science course, but college rule is obligate students to take that course. My major is far away from science but I took that for only graduation, and actually I got a D in that course.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO1><MI1>The first point that I would like to make is that exercise will help older people to improve their mental health.</MI1><SI1> After retirement, a lot of aged people suffer from mental disease such as disabling illness and depression because they do not engage in any social activities. <TR>However</TR>, by exercising regularly, older people could overcome these problems. In addition older people could socialize with other citizens through exercise. <TR>For example</TR>, in a local park, older people could play badminton with their neighbors so they can easily get along with each other.

<BO2><MI2>Another compelling reason that I would like to mention is that older people can strengthen their physical health by exercising.</MI2> <SI2>As people age, they often experience physical illness such as high blood pressure and osteoporosis. This means that exercise is essential for older people. A study by Maeil Business Newspaper, which is an influential newspaper in Korea, shows that older people who exercise regularly three days in a week, overcome the osteoporosis three times faster than older people who don't.

Why have people lived in this way, participating in group works? Although there are many supporting arguments, I want to point out two reasons; to obtain a common goal in an easy way and to be more efficient at tasks.</IN>
 
  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, groups or organizations are essential for people to attain a same goal.</MI1> <SI1>Since a society has been developed, many delicate and complicated works are required for people to handle some current issue. <TR>As a result</TR>, people have created some organizations in order to deal with the facing problems. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, the World Health Organization, or WHO, is an organization composed of many nations in order to act together when there are health related issues.

I ran to her and asked about the days that she was living in the same period of Korean-war. Not like the books or internet, she told me her vivid experiences. There was no food available to feed my mom. How she missed her husband which is my grandfather. She still cannot forget the sound of bomb blowing up. With my grandmother’s help I was able to submit exceptional paper. From the example of my middle school homework, advices and anecdotes from grandparents help children.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, senior citizens view a matter with a different point of view.</MI2> <SI2>As the society progresses, modern individuals who are conditioned to the use of technology, they overlook the negative side of advanced technology. <TR>However</TR>, being not used to the development or sudden changes, grandparents can advice children to keep away from technology. <EX><TR>As an example</TR>, when me and my brother were looking at smart phone instead of facing each other while resting.

According to statics presented by New York Times, people who graduated college occupied 70% of specialized jobs in USA that give less worries about lay-off than part time jobs. <TR>Thus</TR>, I believe that through taking a high level of education, people can get proficiency about their jobs and job interviewer's preference, then many students apply for university or college.</SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>For another reason</TR>, There are abundant chances to try new experiences in university.</MI2> <SI2>Students are able to choose some activities such as joining a club, academy, volunteering, and even doing extracurricular activities. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, while being a member of dance club in the first year of my college life, I could improve my dancing skill, learn how to dance hip hop, and meet new people who have similar interests to me.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, traveling in a group with guidance is very enjoyable and safe.</MI1> <SI1>When people travels with others, there are more chances of having conversations and sharing ideas of what they see and realize. They can also make friends with their companions through spending several days together. Not only that, but they also can be safe because they are guided by a guidance who knows how to stay safe in the tourist site. A study conducted by the ministry of tourism in Korea reveals that almost 60 percent of people prefer taking a group tour to a self tour and more group tour ackages are introduced nowadays. <EX><TR>Also</TR>, from my personal experience, I had fun associating with others when I traveled to Europe.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, it is more easy to acquire information and knowledge about tourist site.</MI2> <SI2>With the guidance, people can get well organized explanation of what they see. Because a guide who is leading the group tour has expertise through education and experience, he knows what tourists want to know and make them understood in a short time. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, I visited United States and stayed there only 3days last year. Although I did not have enough time to see and enjoy the trip, I could get lots of knowledge and information about USA because a tourguided explained to me various things about the places I visited with a well condensed explanation. Other people I traveled with expressed same opinion with me and we decided to go on a trip next year with that tourguide again.</EX></SI2></BO2>
 
<CO><TR>To summarize</TR>, I strongly believe that group tour with guidance is better choice than travelling alone.

"968&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People are never satisfied with what they have; they always want something more or something different. Use specific reasons to support your answer.
",::,"<IN>People generally live in the pursuit of their happiness. That happiness comes from in many ways such as satisfaction. It is natural for people to be greedy for something. <TS>But I disagree that people always desire something more or different because some people actually satisfy what they have and who they are and work for others.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>Look! Christ. He is the best poor man whom people know.</MI1> <SI1>But He did not ask any body to support him. He always satisfied what he had even if he had nothing. There are many religious people who do not have any thing in their life. Such people actually believe what they know and then act what they want. It is another satisfaction. <TR>Thus</TR>, some of people may not always satisfy with their money or status but some of people always feel satisfied because of their belief.</SI1></BO1>

969&Most people should solve important problems by themselves or by their families' help without governmenatal support.,::,"<IN>There has been controversy regarding whether the valuable tasks should be resolved independently without external aid or not. Since governmental support is always not accomplished successfully-government`s intervention in marketplace may cause an inefficiency- some may say that their participation in our society is unnecessary. However, I disagree with this. There are several reasons I would discuss to support my argument so I could limit my discussion to the two that are the most relevant to the topic.</IN>

<BO1><MI1>Main reason for my feeling this way is associated with the concept fairness.</MI1> <SI1>One of principal roles of government is to arbitrate our society between the rich and the poor through taxation. If there is no organization to play such a role in our society, conflict between them will expand and increase, which lead to physical struggle and fight. The authority endeavors to make a balance by imposing rich men on tax with high rate relatively, so taxation will be spent to support and help the poor people. This effort will encourage members of stratified society to harmonize with each other, which helps society stabilized. Is it possible for individuals to try to minimize conflicts inherent in them? <TR>Thus</TR>, our humanity require arbitrator to resolve our internal social problems.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>Another reason is related to public undertaking.</MI2> <SI2>Public road, highway and airport and so on are major transportations of a country. They facilitate inter-regional exchange and promote a flow of people between regions, which is a mainspring of a country`s development. Making a huge Construction for such public facilities not only requires much money but also necessitates much information so that a behemoth like government is suited for these works because there are so many efforts and collaborations of intelligent scholars, experts and instructors inside government to settle down social problems.</SI2></BO2>

979&It is better for student to have one long vacation each year than several short vacations throught the year,::,"<IN>Some people say that it is beneficial for students to have one long vacation each year than several short vacations through the year; <TR>however</TR>, others do not disagree to this. <TS>Although each has its advantages and disadvantages, I personally believe a long vacation is more helpful for pupils for the following two important reasons. One reason is that students are able to enjoy a variety of things such as travel. The other is that pupils get a chance to self-development.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, a long leisure accommodates students with diverse activities.</MI1> <SI1>This is due to the fact that students have the time for anything they want. If they have a short period of vacation, students would not make a plan which is time consuming. <TR>However</TR>, long periods of leisure make students do long plan. <EX>Coming from my personal experience, when I was high school student, my vacation was so short that I could not go Italy to see my grandmother. <TR>As a result</TR>, I did not meet her in my teenagers. If I have a long school holiday, I would see her.</EX></SI1></BO1>
 
<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, people are able to use their long time for self-development.</MI2> <SI2>This is because students can concentrate on their goals. Schools do not interrupt concentrations that students want. According to the recent research, people can absorb knowledge if they study for a long time. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, many short vacations distract pupils' concentration. <EX><TR>Personally</TR>, I have experienced this on many occasions, but the notable example was when i studied Japanese.

<BO1><MI1><TR>Above all</TR>, focusing too much on personal appearance could intrude people from developing their abilities for their works.</MI1> <SI1>Today, almost all young people, especially women, are spending their time for improving their appearance and always concerning themselves about their semblance. Hanging around the clothes and cosmetics markets and applying cosmetics to their faces accounts for much of their precious time while they should prepare much for employment. <EX><TR>For my experience</TR>, while I was studying in a library, I saw a person who often saw her face with her mirror while she was studying.

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, ugly people could feel inferior to the pretty while they are managing their appearance.</MI2> <SI2>They always have discountenance about their faces and their appearance become huge obstacle to get confidence themselves. <TR>For instance<TR>, <TR>nowadays</TR>, cosmetic clinic centers have been filled with people who want to get cosmetic surgery or professional management. Although there are some people who want to improve tiny drawbacks of their semblance, the main customers are people who think they are ugly.

According to the research , it says that less self-confidence of ugly people could result in less confidence in other areas which are not related to their semblances. The results of the research also say that it could decrease the effectiveness or their works. <TR>Eventually</TR>, the social currents impelling people to concentrate on appearance make ugly people to be isolated in both their self-confidences and their real careers.</SI2></BO2>

983&People often buy products not because they need them but because other people have them.,::,"<IN>With the increase in disposable income resulting from economical development, many people can now afford to buy products not out of necessity but by will. This has also resulted in people buying products that other people already have for the two reasons.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, possessions have become synonymous to the stature of wealth.</MI1> <SI1>Many people buy premium products to prove that they are rich enough to spend that small fortune. I've come across many people that buy expensive products neither because they need it nor understand the full features and functionality, but to gain other people's appreciation and awe. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I have a friend that buys high-end mobile phones every quarter despite the fact that she has no interest of utilizing features other than calls, messages and browsing.

Whether it be expensive cars, luxurious clothing and accessories or new technology, one does get the envy of others by flashing their possessions.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><SI2><TR>Furthermore</TR>, it has become difficult to keep up with new technology nowadays. With the rapidly evolving technology, your electronic device becomes obsolete in three months.

984&Communication skills are the most important for leaders or politicians.,::,"<IN>Although there are a variety of opinions concerning this issue, most people would agree that leaders or politicians definitely need to communicate well with other people to achieve their aims. This is largely because the real people who realize the aims are not the leaders or politicians but the group people. <TS><TR>Thus</TR>, for supervising them, the leaders or politicians should be required to have good communication ability such as persuasive power or reliability.</TS> I think that these skills are most important part of leadership.</IN>


  <BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, it is very important that leaders or politicians have a persuasive power because they must convince other people to realize their view in a certain organization.</MI1> <SI1>What was worse, there are possibilities that the dissenters may express strongly opposite opinion against the leader and interrupt the leader’s plan. In this situation, the leaders or politicians have to solve this problem through persuasion toward the oppositions. This is why communication skills are important for the leaders or politicians. <EX><TR>For example,</TR> president Obama have tried to make new bills on the medical care system but he faced stern opposition from the Republican Party. <TR>However</TR>, he finally convinced them and then passed the bills</EX> According to a nationwide survey, the 80% of the people agree with the medical care system.

  <BO2><SI2><TR>Moreover</TR>, the leaders or politicians need to convey their intention to people without distortion. <MI2>If they tell lies or untruthful information to people, the people would not trust the leaders so that the leaders might be failed to manage the whole system of organization and human resources.</MI2> It means that how to communicate honestly and reliably with other people is key factor for criteria of great leadership. <TR>For instance</TR>, the politicians run for election tend to overstate fake commitments for their win. This is not a desirable communication with the public and it hinders the development of democracy. <TR>For example</TR>, president Lee of Korea promised the increasing of minimum wages before winning an election, but it was not realized during the president’s whole of term. For this reason, his approval rate decreased to below than 15%. This reveals that untruthful communication would affect negatively to the leadership.</EX></SI2></BO2>

Also, famous entertaniners in TV commercials induce people to buy the product.</IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with</TR>, people nowadays think too much of what others think of them and try to be as others.</MI1> <SI1>In order to acheive this, they behave the same way as others and buy products sold by majority of people.

986&More and more women go out to work. Is it the government’s responsibility to subsidize them and provide free staff and facilities to care for their children? To what extent do you agree or disagree to this idea?,::,"<IN>The increasing voice for gender equality in modern society has encouraged women to have a job. <TR>Consequently</TR>, issue like responsibility for raising children has become a hot topic around the world. <TS>Many people argue that government should do its best to care for children, helping with subsidies and free facilities. I agree with this argument and my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, the nation can use women's excellent abilities by helping mothers with various polices.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, government can use women's labor if it provides help for raising children. In modern society, female's comparative advantages over male such as sensitivity, shrewdness and emotional approach play a pivotal role in competitive market. In the circumstance on which customer's request for products and services has become more complicated and demanding, female labor is crucial to succeed in the market. As breeding children is the most important factor which obstacles woman's participation as a worker, it will be beneficial to promote them to go out to work through government children-caring offers. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, my sister was really a good student who majored in marketing strategy. At the first job after graduation, she did a superb job in her workplace. <TR>However</TR>, because of a burden for raising her baby, she had no choice but to quit her job even though her performance was not comparable to any other workers in her company. If government had adopted children-caring policies, she would have not quitted her job and both her corporation and she done well in the market.</EX></SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second</TR>, government's responsibility for raising children will boost the long-term economic growth power.</MI2> <SI2><TR>To put it another way</TR>, women will not only take more chances in workplace but also bear many children, as they no longer concern about caring children. It, in the long run, can lead the nation's population to grow rapidly. The late famous economist Robert Solow argued that any other things are not important than population for economic growth. Large population means that the nation's purchasing power is big, saving (which will be used for investment) is  high and the labor is abundant. Japan is a great example. Based on government's supporting program for children care, many women decided to have a job and in addition have babies. A birth rate of Japan increased from 1.1 in 1990 to 1.8 in 2000 and it corresponded with a good performance of economic growth, as GDP increased to averagely 3.3% a year (from 1.0% in 1990) since 2000. It clearly demonstrates that government's subsidies and caring services is necessary both for the nation itself and for its public welfare.</SI2></BO2>

<CO>There is a famous phrase which the late famous South Korean presidents addressed to the public, &quotThe duty of government is to fulfill what is really needed to the nation's people and future.&quot Women as well as men are voicing for government's responsibilities about nurturing children.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, the most important reason for my feeling this way is that technology is very efficient.</MI1> <SI1>In commonly society, time is very important in our lives. If people use a lot of technology, they can save a lot of time because technology encourages people to perform better. Take my sister, for example. <EX>My sister worked in Automobile Company.

<BO2><MI2><TR>In addition</TR>, there is another side effect concerned with offering money for score. If one gets accustomed to get paid for score, the motive to study would decline as the incentive finishes.</MI2> <SI2>Admitting that one can get better paid job with good academic score than otherwise, it is not always the case. After grown up, one has to link knowledge inside oneself and enhance own competence. The immediate and exact match between the money and score is not easily realized in bitter society.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, it is clear that the elderly have more experiences that the young.</MI1> <SI1><TR>To be specific</TR>, it means that they well know what can make them happy from their experiences while the young usually do whatever they think will be interesting without giving much thought. <TR>For example</TR>, Riding a motorcycle is very dangerous and can cause a big accident.

The rationale behind this is that special activities can improve the mental health and develop social skills.</TS></IN>
 
<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, distinctive hobbies from career should be helpful to improve the mental health.</MI1> <SI1>People can feel bored and tired because of repetitive days. They want to release stresses which are from their life. Through hobbies, they can do what they want to and escape the daily life. It should be refreshment to experience something new and special. <TR>Of course</TR>, through these activities people can have healthier mental health and get more efficiency on their job. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, when I was high school student, I really tired about my life and was under stress which was from study.

"995&Now more and more companies like to employ equal number of men and women workers, do you think it is a positive or negative development?",::,"<IN>About two years ago, one famous research team of Seoul National University showed a surprising result about what factors were the most important factor about workplace among college students. Among many available options, the top priority is not wage and social status, but gender equality. The increasing ratio of female worker in the workplace reflects this result. <TS>I firmly believe it is a positive development and my opinion can be greatly substantiated by the reasons addressed below.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First and foremost</TR>, corporations can utilize female workers' excellent abilities.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In other words</TR>, the general strength point of female such as sympathy, sensitivity, and shrewdness can be used to enhance companies' output. Many psychologists and scientists generally agree that men and women have different comparative advantages, even though it should not be accepted absolutely. And from women's point of view, females' strength usually consists of understanding people's emotion, catching a small difference and using it as an opportunity. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, I am a worker of producing soups to customers. Female workers in my company contacted with potential customers emotionally by showing warm attitudes, and they could know what clients really wanted for their soups. They reflected customer's opinion and adapted the soups, such as improving aroma and design. It boosted my company's profit and as a result, those female workers promoted afterwards.</EX> Based on this example, I support the idea that employing equal number of men and women workers can be financially beneficial both to company and workers.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Not only that</TR>, but supporting gender equality in the workplace can make workplace culture fair and right.</MI2> <SI2>From the perspective of employees, many women mean that the greater voice from female workers. It can lead companies' working circumstances more favorable to women, and to both men and women in the long run. By accepting the idea of gender equality in company, many female workers can pursue their career dream as well as take the responsibility of mother's role. Also, employing more women can correct biased view about gender role in the company. This is a good example of promoting gender inclusiveness in the society. According to a study conducted by an Yale University research team, those companies which give more chance to women in terms of hiring, promoting and wage, are more likely to succeed in the market place. The reason is that people regard this kind of company as more favorable to customers, and consequently they have a tendency to purchase more products and services from this company.</SI2></BO2>

996&It is better to have friends who are similar to you than those who are different from you. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>Because of the diversity of genetic codes, there is no such person who are identical with another person. All the people have their own individuality. <TR>However</TR>, people who are grown up in a similar circumstances and same culture have many things in common.

<BO1><MI1><TR>To start with</TR>, having a contact with friends who are similar to me is a lot easier.</MI1> <SI1>This is because it is easy to make a schedule to meet each other. What I mean is that, since people have indistinguishable lifestyle, we often spend a same moment for same things. <EX><TR>For instance</TR>, as I am a university student, when I meet my friends who attend the same university we can call each other any time and contact immediately. This includes having lunch together, taking a break together and studying in the libarary together. <TR>On the contrary</TR>, when I meet my frineds who work in a music bar at night, I have to stay up late and visit the music bar or my friends should wait until the morning.</EX> Keeping touch with friends who are similar to me takes less effort.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On top of that</TR>, I feel more comfort with my friends who are similar to me.</MI2> <SI2>The reason is that there are many times when we feel the things same way. <EX><TR>For exmaple</TR>, let's consider the dinner time. I like seafood, not steak. When I plan a dinner with my friends who are in common preferences with me, we might go to eat seafood. <TR>In contrast</TR>, when I have a supper with friends who like steak rather than seafood, there might be some problems to make a decision.</EX> I feel comfortable when doing things I want to, so I prefer being with friends who are similar to me.</SI2></BO2>

997&Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Being happy with a job is more important than having a high salary. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.,::,"<IN>Some people are saying that pay is the most important thing when a person chooses a job. This is true but it is more important to find a job you can be satisfied with than just to find a high salary job. <TS>Happiness is more important in our lives and this is true for getting a job. Also, if people only concentrate on a high salary job, they can lose a lot of other important things.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First</TR>, it is clear that you cannot buy happiness such as satisfaction in your job and being loved by someone you love.</MI1> <SI1>To illustrate this point, suppose someone have a lot of money but you do not have family or spouse. What is the money for? He could not be happy. In the newspaper, there always are articles about rich celebrities who are illegally trying to avoid paying taxes. People can see that a lot of money in the end could make them irritated and therefore make them unhappy. <TR>Thus</TR>, we should put being satisfied with our job in higher value than finding a high salary job.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>On the top of that</TR>, people who only focus on making lots of money can lose other important things.</MI2> <SI2>There are many diverse values that are important as money or more important that money. <TR>For example</TR>, a hard worker who works very hard to only get a higher salary cannot have enough time to rest. This can cause him to be exhausted at the end make him not work any more. In this case, he could lose both his wealth and his health. Paradoxically if you have proper amounts of works and have some leisure time, it can make you work more efficiently and raise your salary.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>For these reasons</TR>, I strongly say that having satisfaction in the job is more meaningful than getting only a high salary, since happiness is a higher value than money and employees who just try to have much money have a possibility of losing other valuable things.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, using different sources is a waste of time and money.</MI1> <SI1>People search for a topic using different sources, but that material is the same thing, just worded distinctively. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, I used a lot of resources; Internet, books, and magazines, when I wrote a research paper on Atlantic Slave Trade.

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all</TR>, using only one media for information can provoke the prejudice on readers' mind.</MI1> <SI1>True that media should keep neutral side in social issues, most of the medias can not help showing their genuine mind whether it is purposeful or not. <TR>In other words</TR>, media of complete neutral can not exist. <EX><TR>For example</TR>, Chosun-ilbo, newspaper that I am subscribing on is the top brand newspaper in South Korea. <TR>Nevertheless</TR>, there is no doubt that they often disclose their right-wing ideology by particular columns or editorial.
