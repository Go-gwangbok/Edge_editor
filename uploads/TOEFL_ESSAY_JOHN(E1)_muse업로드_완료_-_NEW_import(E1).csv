1&Scientist should take responsibility for their inventions when they have the potential to be dangerous to humans.,::,"<IN>Some people believe that scientist should not take responsibility for their inventions when they have the potential to be dangerous to humans because this people think that inventions which are developed by scientists are so useful for living of human. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I think that they should have responsibility for their inventions when they have dangerous factors.</TS> There are two reasons why I feel this way. One reason for my argument is that they have known negative effect of their inventions. And the other reason is that taking responsibility can give scientists opportunity to develop their studies.</IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> scientists know that they are creating something that has the potential to cause serious destruction. <TR>As a result,</TR> they should share the moral responsibility.</MI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when the atom bomb was developed, Robert Opphenheimer knew that the atom bomb can cause to kill many people and to make cities devastated. But he made the atom bomb and it contributed to break out the second world war.</EX> <SI1><TR>Finally,</TR> creating the atom bomb exchanged the lives of people.</SI1> This example shows that scientist should take the responsibility for their inventions.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Second,</TR> if scientist has responsibility, they can have a chance to develop their research.</MI2> <SI2>Taking responsibility can make that scientists are concerned about public opinion through the internet or news. So they can earn feedback quickly on their creations and it can be foundation to advance the inventions of high quality. <TR>As a result,</TR> taking responsibility for scientist invention bring about improvement of society.</SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> scientists already know that how their creation dangerous and scientist also have an opportunity to develop their creations. So these are the reasons why I think that scientist should have responsibility for their creations when creations has dangerous factors.</CO>
",::,5,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,"Your essay is relatively strong.  Your thesis statement is good and so is your first reason, but the second reason is weak and requires more explanation.  Also, check your facts - Oppenheimer built the atom bomb in the middle of the second world war, and he did not fully realize the danger of it.  That is one weak point in your argument - sometimes scientists DON'T know that their inventions will be used negatively.  Overall, you have organized this essay very well, and your transitions are great.  Excellent structure, and good use of vocabulary.",//
2&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,::,"<IN>As more and more people are seeking after a job where it offers a fine salary, people begin to realize that having a good supervisor is another important fact when considering for a job. In fact, some may say a good leader should be strict and organized since the leader can plan things out more neatly and give proper orders to his subordinates. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly think that having a strong leadership and friendly personality are the most dominant qualities of a good supervisor.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>For starters,</TR> good leadership is a very important quality of a good supervisor because he can make his employees promote faster and that is what they do in their position at work.</MI1> <SI1><TR>In addition,</TR> this not only make the employees enhance their positions but paves the way to make company a better reputation by having good leaders.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> my older sister, who finished graduate school, got a job where it gives enough salary. <TR>Afterwards,</TR> my sister had a supervisor who had a very strong leadership. Since the boss led my sister very well with good judgement and nice advices, she promoted much faster than her friends from graduate school.</EX> This implies that strong leadership is a very important characteristic of a good supervisor.<BO1>

<BO2><TR>Secondly,</TR> friendly leader is probably what the all employees are wishful to have at their work place. <SI2>This is because most of the workers from all over the world suffer from stresses at work because of high pressure from boss or because of unfriendly environment.<SI2><MI2><TR>However,</TR> if a leader is very friendly, that will create much comfortable atmosphere where all of the employees can work with such enjoyment and that will eventually lead to a long term work.</MI2> <EX><TR>To be more detailed,</TR> there was a survey among the workers from renowned company about the reason why they work in the long term. <TR>Not surprisingly,</TR> about half of them answered because of the high name value of the company, but other half of them responded that it is because of good leaders who are very friendly.</EX> This definitely implies the important quality of a good supervisor is a amiable personality.</BO2>

<CO><TR>On the whole,</TR> even though the jury is still out, I firmly believe that having a good leadership and friendly personality is the most significant traits among others because of faster promotion and enjoyable atmosphere at work.</CO>",::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,5,::,4,::,"This is an excellent essay.

3&What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.,::,"<IN>Many people have a tendency to watch sports game on TV. There are many people watch them, although they are televised at late night. <TR>In addition,</TR> people who do not watch them last night used to check the result of game in the morning through the Internet and newspaper, not to mentioned news. It is a good material to have a conversation with others in school and workplace. <TS><TR>In this sense,</TR> playing sports has an influence on our daily life and I think that it is helpful to improve the quality of our life owing to a character that includes some important lessons.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1><TR>First of all,</TR> people can learn various skills that are useful for them to adapt to their life.</MI1> <SI1>Because of the fact that human beings are social animal, if they are isolated from their society, they would feel stressed and turn bad or violent, not communicating with others. <TR>For this reason,</TR> it is very important for them to live in their society. By playing sports, we can get a cooperation skill and social skill that are essential for us. Playing sports is not a survival game, but one of the methods of conversation that makes it possible for them to understand each other.</SI1></BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Secondly,</TR> the advantage of playing sports games is that we can learn sportsmanship, which is called the spirit of fair play.</MI2> Today, a huge number of games are held, with fixed rules demanded.<EX> Soccer game is a very popular game all over the world. However, it sometimes causes terrible accidents that take place in playing field.</EX> It is not right. Not only is it an illegal behavior, but also it deserves to be criticized. <SI2>The most important thing is not the result of the game, not player's attitude. Players have to respect other players, do their best and play fairly.<SI2></BO2>

<CO><TR>In conclusion,</TR> as I just mentioned above, playing sports games provides people with valuable lessons about their life.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,5,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,4,::,"I like your approach to the essay.  I think you have a very easy, fluid writing style, and that makes it easy to read.  I like that, while you have clear main points and supporting points, they are not necessarily in order.  It makes the reader pay attention.  However, I think your actual points are a little bit weak.  They could be incorporated into the same point.  Think a little broader and come up with a second main point that is not so close to the first point.",//
4&You have received a gift of money. The money is enough to buy either a piece of jewelry you like or tickets to a concert you want to attend. Which would you buy?,::,"<IN>Some people may think that purchasing jewelry would better than attending a concert. The jewelry could be valuable in realistic. <TS><TR>However,</TR> I strongly recommend visiting the concert instead of buying a piece of jewelry for two points.</TS></IN>

<BO1><MI1>First point is that people hardly need worrying about losing memories.</MI1> A piece of jewelry would make people worry about losing it. Because of these worries, people can suffer from their mental stress. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> the memory is not going anywhere. <TR>Moreover,</TR> the impression that people could get from the concert would makes people happy. <SI1>With the help of the concert, people could refreshed and concentrate in their work much better by relieving stress form daily life.</SI1> <EX><TR>For example,</TR> when people get a lottery, they might be happy at first. <TR>However,</TR> there is a chance that it could be stolen or lost. So that people could not help worrying. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> if I attend exciting concert, I could recharge myself and get rid of stress. <TR>With this aspect,</TR> the memory of concert allows me pay attention to my work better.</EX></BO1>

<BO2><MI2>The other point is that people can find their new interest by attending concert.</MI2> When people attend the concert, the singerâ€™s feather could be one of attractive things. <TR>Thus,</TR> it can promote peopleâ€™s interest naturally. <SI2><TR>In contrast,</TR> a piece of jewelry hardly promotes peopleâ€™s interest.</SI2> The impression that people get from it is only beautiful or pretty. <EX><TR>For instance,</TR> my favorite singer played the guitar at his concert one year ago. I was so impressed that I started to practice playing the guitar after the concert. Nowadays, playing a guitar becomes one of my hobbies.</EX> <TR>For this reason,</TR> attending concert could let me find my interest.</BO2>

<CO><TR>To sum up,</TR> I firmly recommend that people should attend the concert rather than make a purchase of a piece of jewelry. Even thought it could be a valuable, I can get stressed by worrying about losing it. <TR>In contrast,</TR> I can get helpful memory and find another interest by attending a concert.</CO>

5&The ability to read and write is more important today than in the past. Do you agree or disagree?,::,"<IN>A lot of controversy exists over whether the literacy ability is more significant nowadays than in the past. Some might disagree with the given statement because the advent and development of literacy was greatly improved in the past than today. <TS><TR>Personally, however,</TR> I firmly think that reading and writing skill becomes increasingly more Â important these days for several reasons. <TR>First of all,</TR> the employment competition is boosted now. <TR>Not only that,</TR> but people usually use the Internet in their daily routines.</TS> The following statements will support the opinion.</IN>

<BO1><TR>More than anything else,</TR> people are more competitive than before because it is difficult to find the job. <MI1>In modern society, people are likely to work at the company rather than just doing agriculture living in hometown like in the past. <TR>Thus,</TR> they have to put much effort on improving their reading and writing capability to get into preferred workplace.</MI1> <TR>As a result,</TR> the ability to read and write plays more crucial role in improving people's life. <EX>According to a study recently released by the Korean National Research Center, more than two thirds of CEOs of the corporations responded that they regard reading and wrting skill importantly because it is necessary in working.<SI1>Based on the research, they insisted that second-language is also important in global world.</SI1></EX> <TR>As this example demonstrates,</TR> it is no doubt that the literacy competitiveness is much more important than before.</BO1>

<BO2><MI2><TR>Besides,</TR> the technological development leads people to boost reading and writing skill.</MI2> <TR>Obviously,</TR> it is true that some people still enjoy off-line lives. <TR>However,</TR> current trend is using internet at shopping, doing assignments and communicating with others. <SI2><TR>Therefore,</TR> it is no coincidence that the literacy capability is required to modern people to use the Internet which is based on reading and writing.</SI2> <EX><TR>To illustrate,</TR> one of my friends Jessica is works on the net, not commuting to and from the work. <TR>Also,</TR> she shop around the Internet shopping malls with easy access to computer. <TR>Furthermore,</TR> she communicate with her parents who lived far away by e-mail.</EX> Without the literacy talent, she would not be able to live conveniently and effectively. <TR>In this sense,</TR> people these days should have the talents on reading and writing due to the development of technology.</BO2>

<CO><TR>As I have argued,</TR> I strongly believe that the capability of reading and writing is more importnat than before. This is due to the fact that competitive society and technological development. <TR>Given this,</TR> it is quite obvious that modern people need the skill how to read and write than in the past.</CO>",::,5,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,5,::,4,::,"Overall, your essay style is excellent.  You express yourself very well and give good examples.  I would suggest trying to use fewer transitions.  The points you are arguing feel a little weak, although your examples are very good.",//
