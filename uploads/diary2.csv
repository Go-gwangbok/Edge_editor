"75&<EV>I want to talk about changes in perception.</EV>
The way we think is very critical in our life. This is because it will significantly influence our life decisions.
What sort of TV programs do you enjoy watching?
My family and I take pleasure in watching the program, ""A Master of Living.""
This program introduces people who have been working in their field, doing something with unbelievable techniques, for 20 or 30 years.
The skills they possess go well beyond our imagination. Some can make products much faster than a high-tech processing machine can. Others are capable of hitting a target while blindfolded, only relying on their keen senses.
On top of that, they can amazingly perform what we think is inconceivable with great ease.
Being fascinated, my sister and I once tried to do what they did. <TR>However,</TR> there was nothing we were able to do.
They have reached the level of unbeatable legendary genius in their sphere, through persistent efforts and creative ideas, which don't allow anybody to emulate them.

As I watched them on TV, I realized that they take great pride in their work, which others may not put as much value on.
<TR>Nevertheless,</TR> they consistently study and practice to do things much more effectively and quickly, without giving up no matter what.
<SR>I admire their ingenious imagination, granted by god, which enables them to carry out any challenge they are given.</SR>

Even though many of us share similar circumstances, only a few are able to live in a way, similar to those on ""A Master of Living"" are able to. The people on the show are different from most people because they enjoy what they do and think different from others. The majority of people just do their work without seriously thinking about what they do.

<TR>Then,</TR> despite being equipped with an incredibly huge reserve of latent talent, why are some people inhibited from exploring all the possibilities?
<SR>I think one of the main factors is a stereotypical view which limits our potential to do something more challenging.</SR> Many people are skeptical of their abilities and say things like, ""Since there hasn't been anyone who tried this kind of tough stuff, of course, I can’t do it either.""
Another factor that holds people back is a pessimistic view of life that causes them to lose self-esteem. People are always grumbling and saying things like, ""Who cares if I try my best? That is not important to me at all. I will just do what I am asked to do and that’s all.""

<CO>Please, listen. This is what the Bible says, ""What do you mean, 'If I can?' Anything is possible if a person believes."" Let’s alter our perceptions, and accept every possibility. <TR>Then,</TR> I believe we will gain tremendous momentum that can change ourselves and the world.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,"Not very logical, lacks self-reflection",//
"76&My name is Jun Chae Eun, and I am in the second grade.
<EV>I am absolutely honored to be here with you and tell you a story, ""The Vivid Glasses in My Heart.""</EV>
So, why do you think people wear glasses?
Yes, you know the right answer.
We usually wear glasses when our eyes become worse and we want to see the world clearly. Simply put, we wear glasses to see things better.
However, sometimes glasses don’t function as effectively as we expect.
Let me share an awful experience that happened when I was in kindergarten.
The kindergarten that I went to was going to put on a musical in English.
I had to play a role of a doctor, with black horn-rimmed glasses and a graduation cap, <TR>but</TR> the glasses that I wore were so thick that they made me look rather stupid.
When I stepped on stage, everyone in the audience started cracking up at the sight of me.
To make things even worse, I was unimaginably dizzy because of those bulky glasses. 
<TR>However,</TR> that was just the beginning.
<SR>I almost lost all of my self-confidence to see so many eyes staring at me and, to make it worse, I could hardly locate my position. I couldn’t do anything but cry.
Though the musical had turned out to be a disaster for me, it taught me a good lesson. I learned that the way we see the world varies according to the type of glasses we wear.</SR>
There are some bad common sayings with regard to sight:

<SR>When we are wearing glasses with blue lenses, everything we see in the world turns blue; with red lenses, everything we see will be red.
Generally, we want to believe what we see, and we don’t believe in things that we can’t see. I think all of our potential will be totally different according to how we view the world through the appropriate glasses.</SR>

I would like to introduce a couple of people whose lives have been changed through the proper spectacles in their hearts.

There was a girl named Lee Ji-Seun, who was badly burned in a tragic car accident.
Because of that, she suffered permanent disfigurement. However, she didn’t give up hope. Instead, she thanked god that at least she had survived. With a thankful heart, she went to America and studied really hard and, eventually, she could give vision to despairing people and was able to give them hope. 

There is one more person who changed his unfortunate life into a fortunate one.
He is Dr. Gang Young-woo, who was appointed the Assistant Secretary of State Council on Disability Policy. He was an orphan and lost his sight. Despite all the obstacles, he trusted that he had talent and never stopped studying.
<TR>Now,</TR> he works for disabled people from all over the world.
What kinds of glasses are you wearing now? And what sorts of glasses are you going to pick for yourselves?
The ones that help you see the world with plenty of hope or the ones that magnify your mere problems and ruins your life?
It is up to you to decide which of kind you will select.
<CO>With the most suitable glasses for you, making yourselves open to all the possibilities in the world can be very simple.
<TR>Now,</TR> reach out your hand for your new identity and perspective in life!</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,Honest entry with sufficient self-reflection,//

Well, so during a two year science projects, thousands of researchers from more than 60 countries will conduct more than 200 projects at both poles.
Both the Arctic and the Antarctic are cold. However, the two places have important differences. For one thing, the Arctic is an ice covered ocean surrounded by land, on the other hand, Antarctic is a continent of ice covered land surrounded by water.

Football is such an exciting sport.
Back then, in 1492 King James I of Scotland outlawed this game. Later, Queen Elizabeth I of England did the same thing too.

"82&<EV>I just say “Abracadabra.""</EV>
I’d like to tell you a story that I heard a few days
ago. It made me think about what kind of person I am.
It started with a little boy wearing a nice uniform walking into the backyard. He shouted proudly, “I’m the best hitter,” then he tossed the ball in the air and swung his bat as hard as he could. He missed the ball.
""Strike 1!""
Not hesitating, he tossed the ball once more and wielded the bat and- BANG! He missed it.. “Strike 2!” Then the boy paused for some minutes to carefully examine his bat and ball. He spat on his palms and rubbed them together as if he were a real professional baseball player. He straightened his cap and yelled triumphantly : “I’m the best hitter on Earth”.
He tossed his ball and swung the bat. He missed it again. “Strike three!” he yelled.
He took a deep breath and he exclaimed with great satisfaction on his face, “I’m the best pitcher after all!” 
After listening to this story, what comes to your mind ? <SR>As for me, I burst out laughing and I asked myself, “Can I think in the same way this boy does?” To be honest, I’d be discouraged by this failure.</SR> <TR>However,</TR> the boy in this story didn’t take it too pessimistically. <TR>Instead</TR> he chose to have a positive attitude. <SR>I admire what he said and the way he acted. He gave me a good lesson and a reminder that when one door closes another door bangs wide open for us as long as we have a positive mindset.</SR>
Yes, I can't deny that everybody sometimes faces unpleasant and unexpected situations, such as getting a lower grade at school or arguing with friends. These things get us down a lot. <TR>Then,</TR> we immediately become miserable and begin to complain, 
“Why can’t I be as lucky or as popular as the other kids?”
You know what? This negative attitude won't make anything better.
Now, I have a question for everyone, “How do you see the things happening to you- positively or negatively?”
Usually, we focus on the negative side, stopping ourselves from trying something again that is challenging. Listen! <SR>The only difference between a failure and a success is how you react when you face the situation.</SR> Positive thinking is contagious and it leads to the ""I can do it attitude"" especially, when we are encouraging each other. 
<CO>Just remember that everything you want to get and the person you would like to be depends on your attitude. If you believe this, just say what I say, “Abracadabra, I will get what I think about.

<SR>I was really anxious but I had no idea what to do.</SR>
I just crawled around on all fours looking into all the cracks in my house hoping to spot it.
I burst out crying. It was no use. I ran into my roon throwing myself on the bed and thought miserably, ""Hammy is gone! Yes ...absolutely gone!""
<SR>I regretted how badly I had treated my Hammy.
I thought that if I were trapped in a cage with enormous eyeballs staring at me all the time, I would be really stressed out indeed.

The first grader and second grader received short and light swords, but I received the longer and heavier one since I am a third grader.

<TR>First,</TR> we learned to walk with the sword. (죽도를 목높이로 들고 걷는법). <TR>And</TR> also we learned to hit others with the sword by holding a sword above my head and hit the other's head.

<TR>After</TR> the Gumdo lesson, we played volleyball with a balloon. I jumped to block the ball in front of the net and I jumped to pass the ball hard just like a real volleyball player.

I got 5 points myself. Our team won because of me... Hahaha....

<TR>Also</TR> I now want to have one. 

The beadman is very simple. We put the beads into the beadman's body and push the button on his back and the bead shoots out.

The beads try to knock the boomer down. If someone has many boomers left, then he or she loses the game.

The second game is to push a heavy triangle to the other side. If someone pushes the triangle to the other side, he or she wins.

I wanted to play with the beadman a lot but my friend wanted to play baseball with me. <TR>So</TR> I couldn't play it as much as I wanted.

<TR>From the second game</TR>, I survived until the end of game. I did it again and again for four more times.

It was the best part of game, I avoided the ball which was coming in front of me quickly.

I hopped aside quickly, it was hard work for me, but I made it.

My favorite character is Iquila, my little brother likes Laval, and my mom likes Longtooth.
InChima, the golden key marble (골든 키구슬) is the most important thing since the golden key marble is just like oil. It helps to move every vehicle and can feel the power themselves. 

I want to buy Cragger's ""aligator battle ship attack"" (크래거의 악어전함 공격). There are 7 characters in it.

<TR>After the solo dance,</TR> we learned the partner dance. The tall girls are the males and the small girls are the females since our class is all girls. I am the second tallest in my class, so I had to dance the male part. It's kind of annoying! <TR>But,</TR> I'm used to it. The partner dance is very beautiful, more beautiful than the solo dance! The males become bullfighters and the females become an ox since the Paso Doble is a dance between a bullfighter and ox. It is really fun! I cannot fully express how beautiful and fun dancing the Paso Doble is.

We learned the dance so quickly that our teacher said we can make a dance of our own. It's creative dancing! <TR>First,</TR> all of us choreographed the dance together. It was great, but a smarty-pants girl named Eun Seo was so bad! <TR>Second,</TR> we divided up into two teams. There were four people on each team.

First exam is Korean Language (I'll call it KL). It is my favorite subject.

"262&<SR>I learned about why water is important to society in my English class and wrote an essay about it. </SR>

<EV>Water is very important to a society.</EV> <TR>For example,<TR> the 
Mesopotamia developed faster because of the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers. These rivers gave plenty of water for crops. 
The water also brought minerals and nutrition from the mountain 
tops and other places so the crops were able to grow well. <TR>Because</TR> there were plenty of crops, the population increased and developed big 
cites which eventually formed a country. 

We use water for lots of things: 1. We drink water. 2. People 
give water to grow crops (or other plants) 3. People wash dishes 4. People 
have baths and use it to stay clean 5. Water is used in factories

If there is little water or no water in a society, it will be 
terrible. Only the upper class people would be able to drink water. <TR>Also</TR>, water will 
be about 10 times more expensive than it is now. <TR>And then</TR> the poor people 
would die of thirst. People will try everything to get water. That 
is why water is important to a society.

People in a society should use water preciously. <TR>Because</TR> if there 
is no water people would all die. <TR>Also</TR> people should store water 
and recycle water.
If we know water is important, we should protect water from dirty 
things but people dump waste and pollute water. <CO><TR>So,</TR> I hope people 
would try to keep water clean and sage for everyone. </CO>

"263&<EV>I made up a story about dinosaurs because I like dinosaurs.</EV>


""Hey!"" exclaimed Danny. He was playing soccer with his best friend, Henry. The 
two boys lived in Toronto, Canada and went to Minla Elementary School. They were in 3rd 
grade.
<TR>One day,</TR> a boy named Cole moved next to Danny's house. When Danny had a 
chance to talk with Coal, he introduced himself, and said ""Hi."" 
""Hello,"" Cole responded.
Danny said, ""You are lucky that you have a good neighbor like me!"" 
""Ha! Ha!"" laughed Cole. The next day, 
Henry also met Coal and they all became good friends.
Cole's favorite thing in the world were dinosaurs. <TR>Since</TR> Danny and Henry's favorite thing 
were dinosaurs too, they went to a dinosaur contest.
<TR>Even though</TR> the three boys were strong, they were afraid of Billy, Jones, and Thomas. 
Billy, Jones and Thomas always bothered people.
Billy, Jones and Thomas were ugly. <TR>Once</TR>, they made a water trap and Danny was 
caught in it. 

""Tell me three more types of dinosaurs in China."" said Danny. 
“I only know four types. Hyphalosaurus, Chilantaisaurus, Yandusaurus, and Microceratuis,"" replied Coal. 
""I will add to the list. Gasosaurus, Prenocephale, Sinornithoides,"" said Henry. The three boys 
were preparing for the dinosaur contest. If they won, they could go to China 
and see dinosaur bones. <TR>But</TR> the bad thing was Billy, Jones, and Thomas were also 
going to the contest.
A month passed and the day for the contest came. There were two teams. 
Danny's team and the Kangaroo Elementary School's team. ""Number <1> What is 
chungkingasaurus' group?"" asked the moderator. (A moderator asks the
questions during contests and moves to the next subject and then the next…) 
""Stegosauridae!!"" Billy blurted out. ""Please raise your hand"" said the 
moderator. ""Billy we don't want to get in trouble because of you!!!"" whispered Danny.
Later the score was 50 : 50. The last question came. ""Number <101>. It is the 
hardest question. How do people make names of dinosaurs?"" Danny and a girl from the 
other team raised their hands. ""Danny, please answer the question,"" said the moderator.
""People make up the names by using the magical or amazing part of the dinosaur, the discovered place and the 
special habit of the dinosaur,"" Danny said.
""That is correct!"" said the moderator. ""Woooooo!"" cheered the crowd.
<TR>The next day, at school,</TR> strangely Billy apologized for blurting out the 
answer during the contest. And Danny became friends with Billy. They had a 
happy life together. <CO><TR>Also,</CO> the boys went to China and found plenty of

<EV>The Solar System</EV>

※2011.5.20※
Today was the first day I traveled in a special spaceship (airship) with 

my friend, Omark. We built it with the motor from a small ship. 

The motor was quite small but very strong.

※2011.5.21※ 
We are on the airship. It is easy to control the airship. We only have to tell it where we want to go because there is a 

system to drive it automatically. In about 30 minutes, our airship will reach 

our nearest neighbor, the moon. Then Thud said 

""The moon is only 384,000 km from Earth. Also moon light is reflected from the Sun. The moon's surface is covered with huge dents called 

craters.""

Thud is a mini dictionary and computer. His name is shortened 

from ""The handy ultra dictionary/computer"" to Thud. 

※2011.5.22※
The moon was the same as Thud said it would be. The moon was rocky and there were 

lots of holes on it. When we had to go outside the spaceship, we wore special clothes. <TR>Also</TR>, Omark and I needed air so we wore air banks. It was hard to 

move with special clothes because there was no gravity and the space clothes 

were thick. <TR>Then</TR> Omark was hit by a paper and he went flying into space. I tied 

myself to the spaceship and went to find Omark. <TR>Finally</TR>, I caught him a little 

farther from the moon.

※2011.5.23※
<TR>Next,</TR> we went to Mercury. <TR>But</TR> our spaceship flew toward the Sun. We were 

captured in the Sun's gravity!!! <TR>However,</TR> Omark and I dragged the spaceship away from 

the Sun. <TR>Finally,</TR> we got out of the Sun's gravity. <SR>This was the scariest 

adventure I ever had.</SR>

※2011.5.24※
<TR>Then</TR> Omark and I decided to go to Venus. Thud was sleeping so he didn't say 

anything. When we got to Venus, Thud woke up. He said : 

""Wow, we are on Venus!!! Venus is a little smaller than Earth. <TR>Also</TR> Venus 

rotates in the opposite direction as Earth but in the same direction as Uranus. <TR>So</TR> if you compare Venus and Uranus with the 

other planets, Venus and Uranus rotate the opposite way from the other 

planets. <TR>Lastly,</TR> on Venus, one day is the same as 243 days on Earth and there needs to be 224 days on 

Venus to become a year. Isn't that amazing??""

When we got to Venus, we felt the hotness of Venus.

※2011.5.25※
Venus is a hot planet. Next was Earth. <TR>But</TR> we went to visit Mars instead. One day on Mars

lasts for 24 hours and 30 minutes. It was red and had lots of 

craters on the surface like the moon.

※2011.5.26※
Jupiter is the biggest planet in the Solar System. I thought Jupiter had no 

rings around. <TR>However,</TR> it has a thin and tiny ring made of dust. Thud said : 

""Jupiter has more than 52 satellites. One of the satellites is named Ganymede. <TR>And</TR> 

Ganymede is bigger than Mercury.""

We were going around Jupiter. <TR>Than</TR> Ganymede was flying toward our ship!! <TR>But</TR> like 

magic, Ganymede slowed down and didn't hit us.

※2011.5.27※
Saturn has a big ring around it. It is the second largest planet. Thud said that if there is 

enough water to cover Saturn, Saturn would float. Omark and I couldn't believe 

that Saturn would float because it is so big. <TR>Also,</TR> Saturn has about 30 

satellites.

The rings of Saturn are made of lots of little rings. <TR>And</TR> the little rings are 

made of ice, rocks and dust. Some rocks are as big as some houses found on Earth.

※2011.5.28※
Uranus is the 7th planet from the Sun. It's color was bluish green. Like 

Jupiter and Saturn, it also has a ring. It has 21 satellites.

※2011.5.29※
Neptune has 11 satellites. <CO><TR>But strangely,</TR> one of them is turned the other way 

compared to the other satellites. It was very cold on Neptune.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,1,::,2,::,"Entry is very creative but the details in the story are spotty.

<EV>Treasure hunting at night </EV>


I went to a camp at my international school when I was in a foreign country. I went to the school's camp with my family and my friends in the evening. The school was really big so finding the treasure wasn't as easy as I thought it would have been. <TR>At school,<TR> there were 2 ponds and lots of soccer fields for the children to play. <TR>However,</TR> that day the ponds and fields were not used for playing soccer or games but for treasure hunting. The teacher giving instructions told us students that we should be careful as we try to find the treasure. She also said that from yesterday and today's rain the soccer fields and the grass was soaked and very slippery. <TR>Then</TR> she showed us a rule chart. It read

1. Whoever finds the treasure can get whatever there is in the box. 
2.The given time is 30 minutes. 
3. Don't go in the ponds.(There are no treasures in there.)

<TR>So</TR> I was trying to find the treasure with my friend, Vincent, in the huge school yard. There were about 25 other people. It was raining a lot and frogs were croaking in the pond. I don't like frogs so I didn't go near the frog pond. As we were walking around, there were children whispering about where the treasure could be hidden. <TR>ut just then,</TR> I smelled marshmallow by the camp fire. <TR>So</TR> Vincent and I went to the camp fire and thought that after eating something, we would get a better idea of where the treasure could be. <TR>After</TR> eating about 3 marshmallows, we started off on our adventure of finding the treasure.
When Vincent and I couldn't find the treasure, we went deeper into the dark. There were lights from the flashlights of other children and from the camp fire. When we went deeper into the dark, I was quite scared. <TR>And</TR> the rain kept pouring, which made it more scary.

<EV>My Travels in America</EV>


<TR>Today,</TR> as well as the other days, there was less food. I ate breakfast and played with my friend, Vincent. When I came back our family was very happy because my dad found a bridge (land bridge). We would cross the bridge with Vincent's family and our dog 'gimi'. It was icy cold
outside. <TR>So,</TR> I wore a thick coat made of animal fur. I also wore a hat made of rhinoceros fur. When we crossed the bridge, we slept one night and in the morning went to find things to eat. There were wild plants. <TR>Then</TR> I found a huge footprint. I told my dad that there 
was a big animal around. Vincent's dad, Vincent, my dad, and I tip-toed and followed the footprint I saw. <TR>At last</TR> we saw a huge mammoth. It was hairy and had two tusks. The mammoth was weak as if it had starved for weeks. The adults threw spears at the mammoth, while Vincent and I threw as many stones as we could. The mammoth became angry and stamped its feet. <TR>But then,</TR> when it was hit with another spear, it fell down to the ground. We were happy because today we could have our stomachs full of food. I was so full that I couldn't even move. We saved some of the mammoth food to eat later and saved the fur to make clothes for ourselves. I wondered about what would happen tomorrow. 
I found a plant which I had never seen before. I ate it. It was tasty. I cut some of that plant and brought it to our house. <TR>After that</TR> our family learned how to farm. My mom was happy but said never to eat plants that I didn't already know about. It was good that we didn't need to move. <TR>Because</TR> we could make our food even if it rained. Dad is trying to build our house stronger. I made a necklace out of rhinoceros teeth. 
<TR>And</TR> I also made a sculpture out of a mammoth's tusk. I got the idea from the pointed end of the rhinoceros teeth. The necklace was a present for my mom and the sculpture was for my dad. Tomorrow is the 100th day of coming to this land, America. Mom said she would give us rice and sweet-potatoes for breakfast. Tomorrow we will make an earthen vessel to store food.
I will carve pictures of mammoths on the vessel. I think if I do that I will be more successful on the hunt.

<EV>It was windy in the morning and in the evening. <TR>But</TR> it was warm during the daytime. </EV>

<TR>On Saturday,</TR> I went to the science academy. I made a bottle that water will not fall out of even when it is upside down. I made it with a bottle and a funnel. <TR>First,</TR> cut the bottle 1/3 of the way. <TR>Then,</TR> glue the part of the bottle you cut on top of the funnel. <TR>Next</TR>, decorate the outside of the bottle. <TR>Finally</TR>, put water inside the bottle.

This experiment was interesting because the water didn't leak even when the bottle holding the water was upside down. This thing uses the same principle as a fish-trap. 

When the river flows, you set up a fence in a row. <TR>Then</TR> you set up a fence in a row again but this time leave space for a funnel and put it 5 to 6 meters up-stream. That is how you make a fish-trap.

The author describes Korean history as though she is a mother writing a letter to her child. I think the author is good at writing history books in a letter form because she wrote this book and along with many other history letter books.

I was impressed with the Korean people because during the Goryeo dynasty, when Mongolia attacked Goryeo, the king and noblemen ran away to an island but the people fought against Mongolia and defeated them. I think that the king and the noblemen were irresponsible because they didn't try to protect the commonwealth.

I respect King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-shin because King Sejong loved the people and made the Korean alphabet. <TR>Also,</TR> Admiral Yi Sun-shin fought for the nation against Japan with the 'Turtle Ship' and was always victorious until his death.

I made a mini-racing car with the components in the science box. It was easy because there was an explanation sheet, and it was also because I made the easiest thing. It got harder every time I made the other toys.

My first best friend is Son-a.
We were in the same class last year.
During that time we always played together.
The best time was when we went for a picnic at the Gwacheon National Science Museum.
Fortunately, she and I were a team.
We learned about science and had lunch together.
We had a good time.
Sadly, she is in a different class from mine this year.
We usually meet at recess.
We play and talk together.
She lives near my house.
Sometimes we play at the playground.
We recently played ""Running Man.""
It was very fun.
She likes to play hide-and-seek, too.
Son-a and I are similar in many ways.
We both like to read.
We also like rabbit dolls.
<TR>And</TR> we love to play the piano.
She always speaks loudly because she is not very shy.
She always looks happy.
She wants to be a Japanese interpreter in the future.
I wish that her dream would come true.
Sometimes I quarral with her over trivial matters.
<TR>But</TR> I make up with her.
I like her very much.
I want to have a sleepover with her someday!
I hope our friendship will last forever.

My second best friend's name is Ye-bin.

I play with her every day after school.
She enjoys playing with me very much.
We like to play in the playground.
We play ""Running Man"" these days.
She loves T-ara and K-pop cards.
She is very shy.
<TR>So</TR> she talks to her teacher only three times in a year!
She can't use her left hand because she rolled off the bed when she was a baby.
<TR>So</TR> I help her many times.
I hope we will be in the same class next year!

She likes to play in a quiet place.
She likes to play with Ye-bin and me.
We often play with a little rabbit doll.
She does not like to exercise.

You are dead. What about your family?
Your family and I are very worried about you.

We got in the car and we were squished because there were 6 people in the car including myself. I went in the building and I was surprised. The rock was about 4-stories tall! There were different rocks that we could try to climb. There was rock-A, rock-B, rock-C, rock-D, rock-E, rock-F, and rock-G. 
<TR>First</TR> we were just playing and waiting for the food. Seong Jun and I played soccer. The other guys were looking at the i-pad which Kevin had brought. I thought, whenever there's a party and Kevin is invited, he always takes his i-pad with him. 

The food was ready, but the birthday cake wasn't. Jun Young forgot his cake, so my mom went to get it. We ate the food first, then we were ready to climb the rocks. Everyone started with rock-A, because rock-A was the easiest. I climbed the rock. I was the second to climb the rock.
Jun Young was before me, he was really fast at climbing. We had a belt around our waist so we wouldn't fall down. It was not bad climing the rock, but it was scary when I looked down from the top. It was not bad but it was a bit tiring.

<TR>Then</TR> I tried the other rocks. I tried rock-B, it was slightly harder than rock-A. <TR>Because</TR> it was bumpy and there was a hole. I tried rock-C, but it was even harder becaue it turned diagonally in the middle. I didn't even want to try climbing rock-E, because in the middle we had to climb upside down.

When my mom got back, she had the cake with her. We were ready to sing happy birthday. I helped the moms light the candles. Then we sang happy birthday in Korean, English and Chinese. <TR>Then</TR> we ate the cake, and the party was nearly over. <TR>Suddenly</TR> the 2nd graders came and climbed the rock.

<TR>Finally</TR> there were only 15 minutes left. I tried rock-A and rock-B again. I did not have as much energy to climb it, so it was more harder that time. <TR>Then</TR> all of us played soccer.

The senior students went to China on a trip so we could use the whole playground during our break time.
All of the students have to wear invader's costume.
Mom bought me an armor, shield and helmet set, and she also made a simple ancient Roman soldier's costume. 
There were no classes for the whole day. We only made wooden swords, crossword puzzles,l and other activities.
I thought my costume was quite nice.
One of my friend's helmet looked like Pororo's helmet from the cartoon.
<TR>After</TR> arriving home, Mom bought some clothes for my trip that is coming up this Wednesday.
I took out a suitcase and put some clothes in it to pack for my trip.

"427&<EV>Today my school held a cross country competition.</EV>
The junior school (for years 3-6) held the competition in the morning and the senior school held it in the afternoon.
<TR>Since</TR> the beginning of this term, we have been and training for cross country during our P.E. class. It's very hard. 
We have to run around 1.6 Km around the school. <TR>And</TR> the students in years five and six have to run almost double the length.
Some of the courses are around the lake and some courses have you run on the track.
In P.E. class, sometimes I would come in 3rd or 4th place.
<TR>Before</TR> me, in first place would always be Christopher and in second place would be Thor.
I guess if I try my best then I'll definitely be able to come in 3rd place in the cross country competition.
The weather was quite good. Not so hot and not so cool. Last week's weather was quite cold.
<TR>During</TR> the competiton, the girls in years 3 and 4 ran first. And then about 15 minutes later all the boys in years 3 and 4 started to run.
Today my physical condition was quite good and I had a good feeling about winning. Many parents were coming to watch. My mom shouted, ""Fighting!""
I got a good start. I had a steady pace going. <TR>After</TR> 1/4 of the way through the course I started to run faster. I was in 3rd place and then I kept ruuning.
<TR>Finally</TR> in the end Christopher came in first place, Thor came in second place, and I came in third place. <TR>After</TR> all the students in years 5 and 6 ran, the competition was finished.
I received my medal from Mr. Maguns the headmaster.
Mom was happy and said, ""I am very proud of you.""
<TR>After</TR> finishing competition I wore my medal all day.
Running was very hard but I was proud of myself.

I was happy that there was no Mandarin class (learning Chinese).
All of the middle school students had to wear their house P.E. uniforms.
All of the students at my school are divided into four houses.
The house system is used for competition and integration of students.
Houses can earn points in different competitions throughout the term.
The house with the most points at the end of the term wins the House Shield during the final Assembly.
Our 4 houses are Anand, Howard, Shackleton, and Wing.
Each house has its own color. The color for Wing is blue, which is the color of our P.E. uniform.
My house is Wing. If my sister comes to this school, her house will also be Wing.
Siblings are normally in the same house.
<TR>Last year during</TR> the inter-house math day, Wing was the winner, but this year Wing came in 4th place. I did my best and I don't know why Wing failed this year.
My group had two leaders who are in their 6th year. My group moved to a different classroom every class period and tried to solve long and short math problems.

A lizard named Fred has been living at school.
Its original owner left the school when his family had to go back to their country.

<TR>Beside</TR> the Jinji Lake, the water fountain show is performed every Friday and Saturday night at 8 o'clock.
Suzhou is famous for its canal. So Suzhou is known as the Venice of Asia. There are also some lakes in Suzhou. I've heard Taihu is almost the second biggest lake in China. Jinji Lake is not as big as Taihu. 
Many people take a walk or jog around the Jinji Lake.
<TR>And</TR> I live quite close to the lake. 
It only takes 10 minutes to walk to the lake.
Today my family went to watch the fountain show for the first time since we've been here.
I watched a fountain show before at the Highone Hotel in Korea.
When my family arrived at the place, the show was almost ending.
I thought the fountain show was cool and beautiful.
The water went up so high while music played in the background. The water that splashed around looked like it could be a star in the sky.
The fountain water colors kept changing by a laser beam.
My little sister asked my mom, ""How does the water go up so high?""
I thought she might be impressed by the fountain's scale.
<TR>On the way home</TR>, my sister and I asked if we could buy the glowing toys.
<TR>But</TR> my mom said she didn't bring her wallet.

<EV>My family and Junyoung’s family went to Shanghai on an express train.</EV>
The new train station looks like an airport. It’s big and clean.
<TR>On the way</TR> to Shanghai we looked at the information TV which is where we could see the speed of the train.
It was traveling at 350 km/h. The train speed was so fast and we were really excited to be on it.
<TR>After</TR> arriving in Shanghai we took the Metro and arrived at the science museum.

When I was 6 years old and living in Daejeon, my family often went to science museum there.
My mom asked me about what I remember from when I went to the science museum in Daejeon.
The Shanghai science museum was so big and crowded. 
<TR>Because</TR> it was a Saturday so many people were there.
Every section had a long line so we would have to wait before entering another exciting place.
In the spider section, I saw a live Tarantula spider. I wonder how they captured this spider.
I had so much fun in the play section. 
The science museum was so exciting but we had to take the return train and go back home.

"432&Host: Hello everyone!
I'm your host, Nick. 
Wellcome to Nick's show. 
<EV>Today, we invited some great guests! </EV>
Everyone say hello to them! (Steam comes out and when it clears, there are people ready to argue.) Here is Hollywood star Jamie and a good student, James.
<TR>Today</TR> we will talk about the importance of friendship, and please remember that you should not speak about another topic.
Oh! Jamie just said that we should start... 
We'll get started in a minute, so please wait untill the seats are ready.
(One minute passes...) 
Host: Thank you for waiting, ladies and gentlemen...
Jamie, what do you think about friendship?
Is it important or not important?
Jamie: I don't think friendship is important.
On the internet, everyone says that freindship is good for your health, but I don't think that way. 
<TR>Because</TR> I don't have a lot of friends, and I'm very healthy.
Host: Oh... I didnt know that you had no friends.
What do you think, James?
James: I think friendship is important.
<TR>Because</TR> when I was six, I didn't have a lot of friend's and I couldn't get a lot of sleep.
<TR>Also,</TR> I was very lonely.
<TR>But now,</TR> I no longer feel lonely, I get a lot of sleep and that is all because I have a lot of friends.
Host: Very good job! Now what do you say to that Jamie?
Jamie: There is more evidence.
Friendships can make you die...
James: What?
Jamie: The Daegu student died because he felt guilty. He thought that they could help the student who was stressed but ended up committing suicide. 
Host: Let's finish this today.
We had enough.
That was a very good point, Jamie...
How about you, James?
James: Well... I think friendship can make you feel pleased and happy.
Some of my friends were very depressed when they had no friends. 
<TR>But now,</TR> they have a lot of friends and they say all the time, ""I'm very happy!""
<TR>And also,</TR> I'm very happy, too, thanks to my friends...
Jamie: Do friends teach you anything?
James: Yes, if you have something important to do, such as your homework, friends will help you.
You can spend time together and read.
You can also help each other by sharing information that you know.
Host: Jamie, have you thought about anything to say?
Let's hear your talk, please.
Jamie: You said ""spending time with your friend,"" right?
<TR>But</TR> what happens when you spend too much time playing games because of your friend?
You can spend too much time with your friend, and not know what is going on.
<TR>So</TR> I don't think it is good to have a friend.
James: <TR>But</TR> I could tell my friend that we can finish playing games later and do homework first.
Jamie: That is not a good idea.
What if your friend doesn't obey you?
James: Um... Oh.....
Host: I think today's winer is Jamie!

"433&<EV>Today I will talk about electronic books.</EV>
What do you think about electronic books? Do you think they are good or bad?
I think that electronic books are good for three different reasons.
<TR>First</TR>, we can download the books very quickly.
When we download an electronic book, it only takes 2 to 3 minutes to download and read a book, while buying a book and waiting for the book to come takes about 1 day.
<TR>Two</TR>, electronic books are very portable.
We can bring them in our bags and carry them very easily.
<TR>And</TR> we can read the electronic books on the bus, in the car, on the street and at school.
<TR>Lastly</TR>, we can feel the happiness of reading.
Any child can become happy while reading electronic books.
In some households, there are kids who are reading all the time because of electronic books.
The kids didn't know the happiness of reading before in the past, but now, the kids are reading everything in the house.

Today my dad, Jamie, and I went to Ho mi got.
We were suffering from motion sickness, so we were very grateful when we finally reached the sea. The first thing we saw was the hand sticking out of the sea and the museum's entrance.
We went to the grand museum first.
In the museum, there was an animation above the museum entrance.
The animation was about a girl who was sleeping and had a dream.
The professor made a speech about what he made and how to use the system.
He was saying that the floor will open up and the people will fall into the trap underground.
The people would have no phone-calls, no treats, no weight loss, and no more carbon.
It was a very tricky thing.
We went into the first floor.
There was a flat glass that we could play on.
There weren't as many things to see, even though there were pictures. 
<TR>So</TR> we went to the next floor.
There were many things on that floor.
We saw many things in there. I read some stories about the Ho mi got.
We saw water pressure gauges and lighthouse tools.
<TR>Lastly,</TR> we saw an animation about the Yun-o-rang and Se-o-nea.

When we got downtown, there were a lot of people who were coming and going. 
We saw many people in the way and lots of shops. We found this shop called the $2 shop and I was kind of interested. It seemed like a very fashionable shop. The sign over the shop had a woman wearing fashionable sunglasses and walking a little dog toward town. 
We went into that shop and saw the amazing things inside. Everyone was standing around and looking at the unusual things around them.
On the first floor, there were many things. <TR>First</TR>, when you go inside the $2 shop you will see the walls on the side. Go straight to that wall and look for cellphone ropes or anything else that you might like!

It was a death note.
<TR>So</TR> I needed to write a person's name on it.
<TR>But</TR> my survival rates were slim because I could only write down one person's name and no more.
Jamie's skill was to know all of our tricks. <TR>And</TR> he also had one time to reflect when it's name was removed.
<TR>Finally</TR>, Seng-ju's skill was to restore the time to one hour before.
We started the game!

They play by themselves and they don't pay attention to new students (like me).

They make us memorize 45 chunks of words in 7 days. <TR>But</TR> I also have two classes during the week.

"439&<EV>These days, many people experience school violence.</EV>
There are many more cases these days such as the middle school student from Daegu who recently died. He was always a target for his friends. The friends made him do everything they wanted to him do. They took away his books from him so he couldn't study.
They even went to his house and ate everything at home. 
They hit him and it was kept a secret for a long time.
<TR>Finally,</TR> he became tired and he killed himself. He left behind a note for his parents. 
We saw a video about that in school on Tuesday.
It was all about school violence. The student was being attacked by some other students.
I think that what is going on in schools is horrible. 
<TR>First</TR>,the violence at school can cause people to become introverted or even think about dying. 
<TR>Also,</TR> some students might think that there is nothing wrong with using violence. 
Students need to study and be ready for their lives in the future.
<TR>But,</TR> if they use violence to get everything they want in school, they won't be able to live honestly after graduation.

The red bird, which is the most common type, saw that the eggs were gone. <TR>So</TR> the other birds came and also saw that the eggs were gone. They look at the empty nest for a minute or two,
then the yellow bird saw that the pigs were puting the eggs in the frying pan and trying to roast them. <TR>So</TR> the angry birds go to find and get their eggs back. <TR>Now,</TR> I'll explain how to play the ""Angry Birds"" game. <TR>First</TR> click the button on the front of the phone.

(But this is just my opinion. Some girls could have liked robots when she was younger or other things like music, art, animation and dance.)
When I was young, I always played with my dolls.

I had at least 4 dolls. I can still remember their names.
One doll's name was juju.The doll had long, thin, blond hair.
I think I had 3 more dolls all named mi-mi.They looked the same, so I called them mi-mi-1, mi-mi-2, and mi-mi-3. I had one more doll that I called Mermaid.
I loved Mermaid the best because she was a princess. <TR>Also,</TR> Mermaid had a shell that she slept in. She had a tail, too.
<TR>But</TR> one day, I put Mermaid into the water. <TR>But</TR> I didn't know that the water is not good for the doll's hair.
<TR>So</TR> Mermaid got thrown out into the trashcan.
I can still remember that I used to brush her hair everyday.
When my cousin Hae-yun came over, we played with those dolls.
Oh! I just remembered something! I also had a Cinderella doll.
I loved Cinderella the second best.
<TR>Because</TR> Cinderella was a present I received for no reason.
No reason! Isn't that great? I was so happy...
Cinderella had a doll house that tells the time and says, ""It's 12'o clock! Need to go home!!!""
I loved that house, too.

At that time I wanted to be a hairstylist.

My mom gave me a special notebook for my new school year.
It is a question book. I have to ask a few questions to my teacher in class and then put down both my questions and my teacher's answers in it. My mom said that the notebook will make me pay more attention in class.

"499&Friday, February 4. sunny

<EV>The next day after New Year's Day, I visited Hae-In Temple in Hap-cheon with my family.</EV> As a matter of fact, I went there for the purpose of my travel essay for the winter vacation assignment.

The temple has a fine view with lots of wonderful pine trees and clear valley water along the road by the entrance of the temple.

The temple has preserved the Tripitaka Koreana(팔만대장경) for many years. It is one of the world heritage sites for UNESCO as well as the national treasure of Korea. They say that it was made so that our nation can depend on the mercy of Buddha against neighboring countries' attacks. <TR>Even more</TR> surprising is that it was completed over 240 years ago.

I also saw Sa-ri, the three small crystals of Buddha (부처사리) for the fist time in the temple. My dad said that it was found among the cremated remains of good monks. Some Buddhists pay their respects for Sa-ri with their hands. I thought it was truly amazing that Sa-ri came from the body of humans.

<EV>On Tuesday, February, 22nd, I went to snow slope with my friends (경훈, 해영, and 성선) and the other children, who I go to church with every Sunday.</EV> <TR>So,</TR> at my home, I dressed myself in my ski pants. 

At the snow slope, I ate salty ramyun and delicious kimbap with my friends and with the other children. <TR>After</TR> I ate my lunch, I chose my sled and I rode in a sled with my friends and the other children. I rode in the sled many times with my friends (경훈, 해영, and 성선) and the other children. It was very fun for me, but I never got to ride in a sled with all of my friends (경훈, 해영, and 성선) together. <TR>So,</TR> I was very disappointed.

Going up to ride in a sled was very hard, but riding in a sled was very fun. <TR>After</TR> I rode in a sled with my friends (경훈, 해영, and 성선) and the other children, we ate snacks.

"501&Saturday, January 8th, 2011, a very cold day (On the day that my relative came)

<EV>On Friday, December 31st, (the last day of the year 2010) at eleven' o clock p. m., my relatives arrived at my home with my maternal grandmother.</EV> I was the happiest one at that time. I had waited and waited for them to arrive and at last they arrived. 

I played with 채림 who is my aunt's daughter and 원균 who is 채림‘s younger brother and my older sister. We played and played until it was almost about three' o clock a. m. <TR>Then,</TR> we washed our hands and face and brushed our teeth and 채림 and 원균 slept in my room where my aunt and uncle also slept. <TR>And</TR> my maternal grandmother slept in my sister's room. <TR>And</TR> my mother and father slept in their room, while me and my sister slept in the living room. 

<TR>The next day</TR> when I awoke, 채림 and 원균 had already awakened. I played for a short time with 채림 and 원균 and when my aunt, uncle, mother, father, sister, and maternal grandmother woke up, I ate breakfast with my family and relatives. I thought that the breakfast was good. 

<TR>After breakfast</TR>, I played on the computer with 채림 and 원균 and my sister. <TR>Then,</TR> I went out side with 채림, 원균, my father and my uncle, without my sister. I had a snowball fight and went to the frozen river and played with them there too. I also went near the school where there is a downhill road and sled in the snow with them. 

<TR>After that</TR> we decided to buy a bean-jam bun in the shape of a fish, and eat, because the winter is cold and the bean-jam bun in the shape of a fish was warm. <TR>But</TR> we didn't find a small shop where the bean-jam bun in the shape of a fish is sold. <TR>So instead,</TR> we bought ice cream for ourselves, another one of my relatives who was coming to our house, my sister, mother, aunt, and maternal grandmother. We also bought bread too. When we almost reached home, my other relative arrived and went with us to my home. When we arrived home, we all enjoyed our ice creams and bread, except me, because I was very full. <TR>So</TR> I didn't eat ice creams or bread. 

<TR>While</TR> the others enjoyed their ice creams or bread, I went to my room to get ready to play the violin for my relatives. <TR>Then,</TR> I began to play the violin for my relatives, but 원균 bothered me while I played the violin. <TR>So</TR> I couldn't play the violin very well. 

<TR>After that</TR>, I played with my sister in the bathroom, because in the bathroom, when we switched off the light and closed the door it was very dark. <TR>So</TR> we used my mother's cellphone to light the bathroom. It was very fun. <TR>Then,</TR> I played the piano with my sister and I played 'Monopoly' with 원균, 채림, 해원 who is another one of my relative's, and 유민 who is 해원’s younger sister. 

<TR>After that</TR>, I went to the bowling alley with 채림, 원균, 해원, 유민, my sister, my father, my uncle, and my other uncle. We first watched my father, my uncle and my other uncle bowl and then my sister tried too. <TR>And then</TR> me, 채림, 원균, 해원 also tried too. It was very fun. 

<TR>The next day</TR>, I went to the church with 원균, 채림 and 해원. <TR>And</TR> I came back home with them and took a rest for a minute. <TR>And then</TR> we all went to some kind of place that was like a reservoir, because that place's water was all frozen. There, I sled on the frozen water and watched people who were catching fish in the water. 

<TR>After that</TR> my relatives all went back to their homes. When they went back home, I was very disappointed, because I wished that they would go back to their home even later at night. <CO><TR>But</TR>, it was very fun playing with them, so I wish they would come to our house tomorrow.</CO>

Friday, January, 21th, 2011, sunny but cold (On Wednesday)

<EV>On Wednesday, after me, my older sister, and my mother all ate lunch, we changed our clothes, brushed our teeth, and washed our hands and faces.<EV> <TR>Then</TR> I packed the things that I needed while going to the bookstore and rink with my sister and my mother. I also put tissues in my jacket pocket, because I had a cold. <TR>So</TR> I even dressed warmly. 

<TR>And then</TR> I went outside with them. <TR>Before</TR> going to the bookstore and rink, my mother called for the hired rented vehicle and when I went outside with my mother and my sister, the car was waiting for us. We got in the car. <TR>After</TR> the car arrived at the bus terminal, we went outside the car and went inside the bus terminal, and got inside the bus. <TR>Before</TR> the bus left the bus terminal, we ate the bread and tangerines that we had packed. The bus began to drive to Seoul. 

<TR>Not long after</TR>, I slept on the bus. When I awoke, the bus had already reached the subway station. We got off from the bus. <TR>Before</TR> we went to take the subway to go to the rink, we went to the bookstore that we had decided to go to. We went to the bookstore because my mother said that my sister and I had to buy a book. My sister wanted to buy her favorite novel called ‘듀라라라’, so my mother let her buy her favorite novel. She bought her favorite novel, and we wandered the bookstore and saw the comic book that we know and like. <TR>And then</TR> we bought the book that we had to read. We bought the book that was about the boy who had gone and return from heave and also the book that was about a marshmallow. <TR>So</TR> it is called a 'marshmallow story'. 

<TR>After</TR> we bought the books in the bookstore, we went outside the bookstore and took the subway to go to the rink. We took the subway for such a long time that I was beginning to get tired. <TR>While</TR> we were taking the subway, my sister read her favorite novel that we had bought. 

<TR>Finally,</TR> we reached the rink. My sister and I put on a pair of skates and I put on the helmet. My sister didn't put on the helmet, because she is old enough to not put on the helmet. <TR>And then</TR> we began to skate. My sister was much faster than me. <TR>So</TR> I didn't feel that the skating was as fun as I thought it would be. <TR>Before</TR> going to another place, we ate bread with water. 

<TR>After that</TR> we went to the subway station and took the subway. <TR>And then</TR> we went to the place that sells hamburgers. I ate a chicken burger and my mother also ate a chicken burger with a tomato. My sister didn't eat a burger. <TR>Instead</TR> she ate corn, chicken, and bread with jam. I also ate chicken and bread with jam too. <TR>And then</TR> we left the hamburger restaurant. <TR>And</TR> we went to some kind of shop, that I did not know, because my mother wanted to drink coffee and I had to take medicine (a pill) because I had a cold. My mother gave me medicine and water. I began to take the medicine with water. <TR>But</TR> I accidentally spilled the water. <TR>Fortunately,</TR> the water didn't spill a lot. I took my last medicine with the water that was left. <TR>And then</TR> my mother drank a cup of coffee and we left the shop. 

<TR>And then</TR> we got inside the bus. <TR>Before</TR> the bus began to leave, we ate tangerines and the bus started. <TR>While</TR> the bus was going to the bus terminal, I tried to sleep. <TR>But even though</TR> I was sleepy, I couldn't sleep. When the bus reached the bus terminal, we got off from the bus and we rode another bus that would bring us home. The bus began to start and the bus stoped at the bakery that was near our house. We got off from the bus and we walked to the home. I was very tired, but I was very thankful for my mother because my mother let us go skating at the rink. I had asked my mother to go to the rink. <CO><TR>But</TR> I was very unhappy when my mother told me to write the diary about going to the bookstore and rink. I wish that the skating as much fun as I thought it would be. </CO>

Saturday, January, 29th, 2011, sunny but cold (at the buffet)

<EV>Last Saturday, I went to the buffet with my mother and my sister.</EV> My father didn't go to the buffet with us because he was very tired from playing soccer. <TR>Every weekend,</TR> my father plays soccer with other men who like to play soccer.

I went outside which was very cold and went inside my father's car which is white with my sister and my mother. My mother started the car and my mother drove the car to the buffet. The buffet seemed very far from home to me. I was very dizzy while we went to the buffet. My mother drove to the underground parking lot which was a little bit dark and my mother parked the car. I went outside the car with my mother. I was still dizzy when I went outside. 

I went inside the elevator with my sister and my mother. Riding the elevator made me just as dizzy as riding the car. <TR>So</TR> I became dizzier when I rode the elevator with my mother and my sister. When I went outside of the elevator with my mother and my sister, we had to wait about an hour because there were a lot of people who came to this buffet. <TR>While</TR> we waited for one hour, me and my sister went to the bathroom and played a cell phone game. My mother just sat down on the green chair where we had sat down and drank some water. 

<TR>Finally</TR>, we could eat our dinner. We waited 'exactly' one hour, not 'about' one hour. I sat down at the table where we would eat our dinner with my mother and my sister. My sister an I stood up from the chair and table and ran to the white dish. My sister and I picked up the white dish and chose the food that we liked and placed it upon the white dish. <TR>And after</TR> I ate everything, I stood up again and did that over and over with my mother and my sister. 

I ate small chicken, steak, very thin pizzas, pink marshmallows, chocolate cake, very sweet brownies, small potato (a vegetable that I like), fruit (orange colored tangerines, purple grapes, a little green and yellow pineapples), other kind of meats, drank purple grape juice, and so on. 

There were many healthy foods that I didn't like. <TR>So</TR> I was very ashamed of myself. I deliciously ate the food with my mother and my sister and we all drank some green tea. We didn't drink much, because we were very full by eating many different kinds of foods. I was so full that I couldn't even move and neither could my sister. <TR>And</TR> I wanted to take some pink marshmallows to my father but the customers weren't allowed to take food home. <TR>So</TR> I was very disappointed. My sister and I played each other and we had to go home. 

I went outside the buffet with my mother and my sister and rode the elevator. <TR>Of course,</TR> riding elevator made me very dizzy just as I thought it would. <TR>And then</TR> we went to the underground parking lot which was a little dark like when we went inside the buffet. I got inside the car with my sister and my mother and my mother stated the car. My mother drove the car and we went home. <TR>Of course,</TR> I was very dizzy while we rode my father's car. 

<CO>I wish that I would not get dizzy when I ride a car or elevator or ship. <TR>And</TR> I wish that I will go to that buffet the next time with my mother, my father, and my sister. I hope that my father will like the foods that is at the buffet. </CO>

Tuesday, February, 8th, 2011, sunny but a little cold (On the Lunar New Year) 

<EV>On Wednesday, February, 2nd, 2011, I went to Gang-Leng (강릉) which is in Gang-One-Doe with my mother, my father, and my sister because my father's family is mostly in Gang-Leng.</EV> We went because it was the the Lunar New Year which is one of the Korean holidays. I got inside my father's white car with my family and my father started the car and my family and I went to Gang-Leng. I knew that my sister went there with us to get the gift of money given to the young people on New Year's day. I also went there with them to get the money. <TR>But</TR> I went there with my family to play with my relatives. Gang-Leng is very far from Yong-In. Yong-In is where I live with my mother my father and my sister. It takes about three or four hours by car if we drive there fast. <TR>But</TR> when it is a Korean holiday like the Lunar New Year, it takes about five or six hours. <TR>Because</TR> many people go to their relatives house if it is the Lunar New Year. 

<TR>While</TR> I went to Gang-Leng with my family, my sister and I listened to our favorite music and deliciously ate the snacks that my mother had packed before I went to Gang-Leng with my mother, my father, and my sister. <TR>And then</TR>, I slept inside the car. When I awoke, my sister was eating baked potatoes that she got at the rest stop. I ate baked potatoes with my sister. 

<TR>And after</TR> that I played with the black laptop that father packed for my sister before I went to Gang-Leng with my family. In the car we can use the laptop. <TR>But</TR> we can't use the internet. I watched the Screen Shots with my sister. There were a lot of Screen Shots in the computer. 

<TR>While</TR> my sister and I watched the screen shots, my family and I arrived at Gang-Leng. My family and I arrived at my mother and my father's niece's house who is about eighteen years older than me. My family and I went inside her house. <TR>Before</TR> my family and I went inside her house, we heard a barking noise. 

When my family and I went inside her house, we saw two puppies. One puppy was white, and the other puppy was brown. I sat down at the table with my family, because she had cooked for us and we had to eat dinner. <TR>After</TR> I ate dinner with my family, we ate fruit. <TR>And</TR> I gave fruit to the puppies with my mother. They ate the fruits very well.

<TR>And then</TR> my sister and I went into the bedroom and played with on the computer. My sister and didn't play with the laptop, because we couldn't use the internet on that computer. <TR>While</TR> my sister and I played with the computer, my mother and my father's niece's husband arrived at her home. My sister and I still played with the computer. <TR>And then</TR> I ate a brown, small walnut-flavored cake in the size and shape of a walnut with my family. It was very delicious to me. <TR>After that</TR> I played with the computer a little bit more with my sister. 

<TR>Then</TR> my family and I washed our hands and faces and brushed our teeth. My sister, my father, and I played with the white puppy. The white puppy was very cute. My sister, my father, and I couldn't catch the brown puppy which kept running away, if we tried to catch the brown puppy. <TR>And then</TR> my family and I slept. 

The next morning my family and I got up at six o'clock. I was very sleepy and so was my sister. When I awoke, I dressed myself in traditional Korean clothes. <TR>And then</TR> my family and I went outside the house. <TR>And then</TR> my family and I got in my father's car and my father started the car and me and my family went to my paternal grandmother's house. 

At my paternal grandmother's house, before bowing to our ancestors, I played a game on my mother's cell phone with my sister. The cell phone game was very fun to me and I think that the cell phone game is fun for my sister too. <TR>And then,</TR> my paternal grandmother and my father's brothers and one of my father's brother's son all bowed, and my father and I prayed, but I was only pretending to pray, because I didn't actuall pray. 

<TR>After that</TR>, my family, my father's two older brothers and one of my father's brother's son who's name is 푸름, my paternal grandmother, and I ate breakfast. <TR>And then</TR> my mother, my father, my father's two older brothers bowed to my paternal grandmother and said '새해 복 많이 받으세요' which means 'may you receive many new blessings this year.' Koreans always say this when they are bowing to their elders on the new year. <TR>And then</TR> my sister, one of my father's brother's sons, and I bowed to our paternal grandmother and said 'may you receive many new blessings this year.' <TR>And</TR> my paternal grandmother gave my sister, one of my father's brother's sons, and me money. <TR>So</TR> my sister was very happy. <TR>And then,</TR> my sister, one of my father's brother's sons, and I bowed to my father, my mother, and my father's brothers. <TR>And</TR> they gave me sister, one of my father's brother's sons, and me money. I got more than one hundred thousand won and my sister got one hundred sixty thousand one. <TR>And</TR> one of my father's brothers gave me some kind of book about Chinese characters to help me learn Chinese characters really well. I thanked him and I went into the room that my sister was in. She was playing games on my mother's cell phone. I watched her playing game as I waited for my turn, and then it was my turn to play. I played cell phone game while my mother, my father and one of my father's brother's sons talked about how we would go to the beach that was near my paternal grandmother's house. 

<TR>A few minutes later</TR>, my family, and my father's brothers's family, and I went to the beach which was near my paternal grandmother's house with my father's car and my father's brothers's car. When my family, my father's brothers's family, and I arrived at the beach we all played at the beach.

We did not play with the water, but with the sand, because the Lunar New Year is in the winter, and it was too cold to play in the water. My sister, my father, and I drew a guitar, car, and violin on the sand then we all took a picture of me and of ourselves. <TR>And then</TR> we all went back to my paternal grandmother's house again. We all stayed there for a while and we ate lunch. 

<TR>And then</TR> my family and I went to my maternal grandmother's house which is in Gu-Ri. <TR>From</TR> Gang-Len to Gu-Ri was much farther than Yong-In to Gang-Leng. So, while my family and I went to my maternal grandmother's house, I slept in the car again. When my family and I arrived at the rest stop, my father woke my sister and me up. <TR>And then</TR> my sister and I went to the restroom which was a little bit of smelly. I went to the restroom that was for men. My sister went to the restroom that was for women. I peed in the urinal that is only in the restroom for men. <TR>Then</TR> I washed my hands and went out of the restroom for men and I waited for my sister. She came out of the restroom for women and my sister and I met my father and my mother who were buying chicken for my sister and me. 

<TR>After</TR> my mother and my father bought chicken for my sister and me, my family and I went back to my father' s white car with the chicken and my sister and I ate chicken and drank '포카리스웨트‘ which is a brand name for drinking water. My father started his car and my family and I were on our way to my maternal grandmother's house again. 

About thirty minutes later, my family and I finally arrived at my maternal grandmother's house. When I went outside the car, I was very dizzy, because my family and I had gone to my maternal grandmother's house in the car. <TR>And</TR> I get very dizzy when I ride in a car for a long time. My family and I took the elevator and my mother rang the bell when my family and I left the elevator. The door opened and my maternal grandmother came out of the house and let my family and I come inside. She went back inside to her house. 

I saw that my uncle, my uncle's wife (외숙모), and my uncle's daughters (혜원, and her younger sister 유민) were already there. 혜원 is twelve years old like me, and 유민 is nine years old. 혜원 is taller than me, even though she is girl. 

When I entered the livingroom, I played with 혜원 and 유민 and ate dinner with them and my sister. My mother, my father, my uncle, his wife and my maternal grandmother also ate dinner. <TR>After that</TR>, 혜원, 유민, and I decided that we would surprise 채림 and her younger brother 원균 when they arrived. 채림 and 원균 are my aunt's daughter and son. My aunt said on the phone that they would come to my maternal grandmother's house at ten thirty. The time that me, 혜원, and 유민 had decided to surprise 채림 and 원균 was around seven o' clock or maybe later. <TR>But</TR> 혜원, 유민, and I soon gave up that plan, because it wasn't as easy as we thought. 

<TR>After that</TR>, my sister, 혜원, 유민, and I all sat down in the livingroom and watched television. <TR>Then</TR> I played with the laptop that my father brought, with 혜원 and 유민. While I played on the laptop with them, 채림 and 원균’s family finally arrived at my maternal grandmother's house. 채림 and 원균 also joined while I played on the laptop with 혜원 and 유민. 

<TR>And then,</TR> the children including myself, bowed to my maternal grandmother and said 'may you receive many new blessings this year' and my maternal grandmother, my mother, my father, my uncle, his wife, my aunt and her husband gave money to us. <tR>After that</TR> we played with each other again and washed our hands and faces and brushed our teeth and changed our clothes and slept. 

My mother, my father, my sister, my aunt, her husband my uncle, her wife, and my maternal grandmother also slept. <TR>The next morning</TR> all of the children including myself watched a movie on the television and ate breakfast and played with each other. <TT>And</TR> we went to 채림 and 원균's house and played again. About thirty minute later, my family and 혜원’s family returned home.

I also put tissues in my jacket pocket, because I had a cold. <TR>So</TR> I even dressed warmly. 

<TR>And then</TR> I went outside with them. <TR>Before</TR> going to the bookstore and rink, my mother called for the hired rented vehicle and when I went outside with my mother and my sister, the car was waiting for us. We got in the car. <TR>After</TR> the car arrived at the bus terminal, we went outside the car and went inside the bus terminal, and got inside the bus. <TR>Before</TR> the bus left the bus terminal, we ate the bread and tangerines that we had packed. The bus began to drive to Seoul. 

<TR>Not long after</TR>, I slept on the bus. When I awoke, the bus had already reached the subway station. We got off from the bus. <TR>Before</TR> we went to take the subway to go to the rink, we went to the bookstore that we had decided to go to. We went to the bookstore because my mother said that my sister and I had to buy a book. My sister wanted to buy her favorite novel called ‘듀라라라’, so my mother let her buy her favorite novel. She bought her favorite novel, and we wandered the bookstore and saw the comic book that we know and like. <TR>And then</TR> we bought the book that we had to read. We bought the book that was about the boy who had gone and return from heave and also the book that was about a marshmallow. <TR>So</TR> it is called a 'marshmallow story'. 

<TR>After</TR> we bought the books in the bookstore, we went outside the bookstore and took the subway to go to the rink. We took the subway for such a long time that I was beginning to get tired. <TR>While</TR> we were taking the subway, my sister read her favorite novel that we had bought.

<TR>Finally,</TR> we reached the rink. My sister and I put on a pair of skates and I put on the helmet. My sister didn't put on the helmet, because she is old enough to not put on the helmet. <TR>And then</TR> we began to skate. My sister was much faster than me. <TR>So</TR> I didn't feel that the skating was as fun as I thought it would be. <TR>Before</TR> going to another place, we ate bread with water. 


<TR>After that</TR> we went to the subway station and took the subway. <TR>And then</TR> we went to the place that sells hamburgers. I ate a chicken burger and my mother also ate a chicken burger with a tomato. My sister didn't eat a burger. <TR>Instead</TR> she ate corn, chicken, and bread with jam. I also ate chicken and bread with jam too. <TR>And then</TR> we left the hamburger restaurant. <TR>And</TR> we went to some kind of shop, that I did not know, because my mother wanted to drink coffee and I had to take medicine (a pill) because I had a cold. My mother gave me medicine and water. I began to take the medicine with water. <TR>But</TR> I accidentally spilled the water. <TR>Fortunately,</TR> the water didn't spill a lot. I took my last medicine with the water that was left. <TR>And then</TR> my mother drank a cup of coffee and we left the shop. 

<TR>And then</TR> we got inside the bus. <TR>Before</TR> the bus began to go, we ate tangerines and the bus started. <TR>While</TR> the bus was going to the bus terminal, I tried to sleep. <TR>But even though</TR> I was sleepy, I couldn't sleep. When the bus reached the bus terminal, we got off from the bus and we rode another bus that would bring us home. The bus began to start and the bus stoped at the bakery that is near our house. We got off from the bus and we walked to the home. I was very tired, but I was very thankful for my mother because my mother let us go to the rink and skate. I had asked my mother to go to the rink. <CO><TR>But</TR> I was very unhappy when my mother told me to write a diary entry about going to the bookstore and rink. I wish that the skating had been as fun as I had thought. </CO>

"504&Saturday, January 8th, 2011, very cold day (On the day that my relatives came)

<EV>On Friday, December 31st, (the last day of the year 2010) at eleven' o clock p. m., my relatives arrived at my home with my maternal grandmother.</EV> I was the happiest one at that time. I had waited and waited for them to arrive and at last they arrived.

I played with 채림 who is my aunt's daughter and 원균 who is 채림‘s younger brother and my older sister. We played and played until it was almost about three' o clock a. m. <TR>Then,</TR> we washed our hands and face and brushed our teeth and 채림 and 원균 slept in my room where my aunt and uncle also slept. <TR>And</TR> my maternal grandmother slept in my sister's room. <TR>And</TR> my mother and father slept in their room, while me and my sister slept in the living room.

<TR>The next day</TR> when I awoke, 채림 and 원균 had already awakened. I played for a short time with 채림 and 원균 and when my aunt, uncle, mother, father, sister, and maternal grandmother woke up, I ate breakfast with my family and relatives. I thought that the breakfast was good.

<TR>After breakfast</TR>, I played on the computer with 채림 and 원균 and my sister. <TR>Then,</TR> I went out side with 채림, 원균, my father and my uncle, without my sister. I had a snowball fight and went to the frozen river and played with them there too. I also went near the school where there is a downhill road and sled in the snow with them. 

<TR>After that</TR> we decided to buy a bean-jam bun in the shape of a fish, and eat, because the winter is cold and the bean-jam bun in the shape of a fish was warm. <TR>But</TR> we didn't find a small shop where the bean-jam bun in the shape of a fish is sold. <TR>So instead,</TR> we bought ice cream for ourselves, another one of my relatives who was coming to our house, my sister, mother, aunt, and maternal grandmother. We also bought bread too. When we almost reached home, my other relative arrived and went with us to my home. When we arrived home, we all enjoyed our ice creams and bread, except me, because I was very full. <TR>So</TR> I didn't eat ice creams or bread. 

<TR>While</TR> the others enjoyed their ice creams or bread, I went to my room to get ready to play the violin for my relatives. <TR>Then,</TR> I began to play the violin for my relatives, but 원균 bothered me while I played the violin. <TR>So</TR> I couldn't play the violin very well. 

<TR>After that</TR>, I played with my sister in the bathroom, because in the bathroom, when we switched off the light and closed the door it was very dark. <TR>So</TR> we used my mother's cellphone to light the bathroom. It was very fun. <TR>Then,</TR> I played the piano with my sister and I played 'Monopoly' with 원균, 채림, 해원 who is another one of my relative's, and 유민 who is 해원’s younger sister.

<TR>After that</TR>, I went to the bowling alley with 채림, 원균, 해원, 유민, my sister, my father, my uncle, and my other uncle. We first watched my father, my uncle and my other uncle bowl and then my sister tried too. <TR>And then</TR> me, 채림, 원균, 해원 also tried too. It was very fun.

<TR>The next day</TR>, I went to the church with 원균, 채림 and 해원. <TR>And</TR> I came back home with them and rested for a minute. <TR>And then</TR> we all went to some kind of place that was like a reservoir, because the water there was all frozen. There, I sled on the frozen water and watched people who were catching fish. 

<TR>After that</TR> my relatives all went back to their homes. When they went back home, I was very disappointed, because I had wished that they would go back to their home even later at night. <CO><TR>But</TR>, it was very fun playing with them, so I wish they would come to our house tomorrow. .</CO>

"505&Friday, December 31st, 2010, sunny day (On Christmas)

<EV>On Friday, December 24th, we started winter vacation.</EV> <TR>Since</TR> it was 방학식, I went home at ten thirty, which was much earlier than usual. <TR>Every day</TR> except the special days like Saturday or 방학식, I go home at one thirty. <TR>Of course, because</TR> it is 방학식, my classmates and I didn't eat lunch or drink milk at school. <TR>Every day</TR> my classmates and I also drink milk, which tastes awful to me. <TR>On the way home</TR>, I was very happy because we will not go to school for a long time. 

When I reached home, I rested and ate lunch. <TR>Then</TR> I practiced violin for Christmas. I was going to play the violin at church, because it is almost Christmas. I practiced violin in the evening. <TR>Since</TR> I was going to play the violin on the day when it was 방학식 for me, I was very nervous. I was going to play two tunes. One tune was ‘주님 다시 오실 때까지’ and the other was ‘저들 밖에 한밤 중에’. These tunes are in the hymn book. That is why I was going to play '주님 다시 오실 때까지' and '저들 밖에 한밤 중에’. I thought about that while practicing.

I'm not good at the violin. To me, the ‘저들 밖에 한밤 중에’ was easier than the ‘주님 다시 오실 때까지’. I practiced playing the violin even when I was at church, before I played the violin for Christmas. My mother made sure that the violin sounded good and beautiful. 

<TR>After</TR> I practiced a lot, my mother gave me and my sister cookies when my sister arrived. She hasn't been with us. <TR>After</TR> the other people did a dance routine and praise, finally, it was my turn to play the violin. I was so nervous when I went on the stage. <TR>Since</TR> my violin's sound is soft, my mother asked to place a microphone near the violin. <TR>So</TR> the people could hear my violin.

<TR>After</TR> I played the two tunes, I bowed and went down from the stage. There were little stairs so I could easily go down from the stage. I went to the chair where I had sat before I played the violin. I felt very comfortable when I finished playing the violin. <TR>But</TR> not long after, I went to the church basement and got chocolates, tangerines, bread, and gloves. <TR>And then</TR> my sister sang in the chorus. <TR>And then</TR> my father did a praise and dance routine with other people's fathers. <TR>But</TR> my father almost didn't do the dance routine. He didn't move his body much while the other fathers moved their bodies a lot.<TR> So</TR>, my sister and I wanted to laugh. I did not know why, but my father wore white gloves and so did the others while they did their dance routine and praise. 

<TR>After that</TR>, we went home. When we reached home, we ate dinner. The dinner was ribs. I like ribs very much. <TR>But</TR> my sister likes ribs more than me. The ribs were very delicious. We ate ribs with rice. It was a very good evening. <TR>Even</TR> the dinner was very delicious. <TR>But</TR> it wasn't so good. <CO><TR>So</TR> I wished that next year would be more interesting. <TR>And because</TR> the winter vacation was beginning, I was more excited. </CO>",::,3,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,"Sometimes the grammar issues hindered the flow of the essays, but otherwise it was fine.",//
"506&Wednesday, December 22nd, 2010, sunny day (family meeting time)

<EV>My family had a meeting three weeks ago (on Saturday) because my father told us to have a family meeting every week on Saturday or Sunday.</EV> He told us that we were going to have a meeting about what we have to do in a week. We have to tell the family about three things or more. Something that were special. <TR>First</TR>, we have to write on a meeting notebook about what we have to do in a week, three things or more. <TR>And then</TR> we would have a family meeting. My sister and I didn't want to have a family meeting because when we have a family meeting we cannot watch Gag Concert on television. I like Gag Concert, because it's very funny. Gag Concert starts at nine o'clock and ends at ten twenty five. <TR>But</TR> we finish the family meeting at nine thirty when we have a family meeting on Sunday. We did not have a family meeting on Saturday, because we forgot about the family meeting on Saturday. <TR>And</TR> we get tired when we have a family meeting. 

<TR>Every week,</TR> we have a family meeting in the living room. <TR>So</TR> every week, me and my sister try to run away from the living room when my dad tells us to start the family meeting. <TR>But</TR> we could never stop the family meeting because my father said that we have to practice having a meeting. My father said that I was very good when we had a family meeting. <TR>But</TR> my sister's manner was not very good during a family meeting. <TR>Instead,</TR> she looked very tired. So my father told my sister to ask a question to the person who was presenting about the week. <TR>Because</TR> she didn't ask many questions. I thought my sister had been very angry and tired about it. 

<TR>Three weeks ago,</TR> my mother didn't attend the family meeting. Only me, my sister, and my father had a family meeting. <TR>Maybe because</TR> we didn't know that my mother should also attend the family meeting with us, or maybe because she was very busy hanging the wash. I thought that that's not fair. My sister thought that too. <TR>So</TR> the next week my mother also attended the family meeting with us. 

<TR>Three weeks ago</TR>, my father had been the family meeting's first chairman. <TR>Then,</TR> two weeks ago, my sister had been the chairman. <TR>Then</TR>, last week, I had been the chairman, and then, on this Saturday or Sunday, my mother will be the chairman. <TR>And</TR> on next Saturday or the next day (next Saturday's next day) my father will be the chairman again. 

When I was the chairman I said that I didn't want to be the chairman, because I thought that being the chairman would be hard for me. <TR>But</TR> my father kept saying that I should be the chairman, so I did. We set a table that was enough for my father, my mother, my sister and me on the living room floor. <TR>And</TR> we greeted each other, and used honorifics to each other because during the meeting, we have to use honorifics to each other. <TR>And</TR> the chairman would tell who will be first and who will be next by him or herself. That's the meeting procedure. <TR>And</TR> the chairman and some other persons would talk about what each person did during the week. We should tell them the meeting procedure. <TR>And after</TR> we tell them, the chairman would tell the others to ask questions. If they had a question, they would raise their hands and say that they have a question. <TR>And</TR> if they have no more questions, the chairman would tell the next person to tell everyone about what he or she did during the the week. If it was the last person to tell the others about what he or she had to do during the week, we would pay respect to each other and then the chairman would say that the family meeting was over. When we had finished the family meeting, we were very happy that my mother was there. It seemed that my mother didn't want to attend the family meeting like us. 

I wonder if my father likes having a family meeting. I think he doesn't like having a family meeting. I wonder if my mother is comfortable when she is not at the family meeting with us. <CO>I think hanging the wash is easier than having a family meeting. I wish that one month later, we will not have family meetings anymore. Or, I wish that I'm not tired during family meetings.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,2,::,3,::,"To help the entry flow better, some grouping of thoughts together would have helped.

"507&Saturday, December 18th, 2010, sunny day (Excercise)

<EV>There are many ways of exercising in the world, such as playing basketball, soccer, baseball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, volleyball, boxing, swimming, and so on.</EV> There are aerobic exercises and anaerobic exercises. <TR>Mostly</TR>, walking, biking, swimming, and so on use aerobic excercise, and short distance running, weight lifting, push-ups, and so on use anaerobic excercise. Aerobic exercise requires oxygen and anaerobic exercise needs energy. That is why anaerobic exercise does not need oxygen. 

<TR>Before</TR> exercising, we have to stretch because we can release pressure and during exercise, our body won't hurt as much. <TR>So</TR> most people who exercise stretch before exercising. I also stretch before I exercise. <TR>But</TR> only before swimming do I stretch. <TR>Before</TR> doing other kinds of exercise, I do not stretch. There are many kind of stretching too. <TR>Such as</TR> shoulder stretching, chest and shoulder stretching, abdomen stretching, back and hip stretching, waist and shoulder stretching, and so on. 

There are a lot of ways to swim. <TR>Such as</TR> free style, back stroke, breast stroke, butterfly stroke, and so on. If we lie down on the water, we will float. <TR>But</TR> the person who is afraid of the water will sink (when that person is in the water), because they stand in the water. 

If the bicycle's gear is low we cannot ride our bicycles fast. <TR>But</TR> if the bicycle's gear is high, we could ride our bike very fast, even though we do not move our feet very fast. 

If we throw the basketball into the hoop, we should jump and throw the ball into the goal. <TR>So</TR> the ball will not fall to the ground without getting inside the hoop. 

When you play soccer, you pass the ball to each other and the ball has to go into the goal like in basketball. <TR>But</TR> the goalkeeper can block the goal and then the ball can't go into the goal. <TR>But</TR> if the goalkeeper makes a mistake, the ball can go in the goal. 

Table tennis is called table tennis because it is the same as tennis. <TR>And</TR> this ball exercise is played on a table. Table tennis is also called ping-pong. <TR>But</TR> the table tennis racket and the ball's appearance and their sizes are different from tennis. The table tennis racket and the ball are smaller than the tennis racket and the ball. 

One ball used in exercising can go very fast. <TR>None of</TR> the other balls can be faster than this ball. It is the badminton birdie. <TR>But</TR> badminton birdies are slow when they almost reach the ground. 

People exercise because exercising is good for people. <TR>For example</TR>, they make muscles stronger and they are fun and they are good for our body. If we exercise a lot, our body will never get fat. <TR>So</TR> exercise can also become a way to diet. <CO>I wish that exercising was easy. <TR>Because</TR> I would exercise every day if exercising were easy. <TR>Then</TR> I would never be fat.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,1,::,4,::,"Because there were no transitions between most of the sports, it seemed very unfocused, the way it was jumping from one sport to the next.

"508&Sunday, December 12th, 2010, sunny day (Restaurant)<EV>Last Friday, after I came back home from the music academy, I went to a restaurant with my family.</EV> <TR>Because</TR> my sister had finished her test. She had taken her test on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. <TR>So</TR> my father let us go to the restaurant. <TR>Before</TR> we went to the restaurant I didn't want to go to the restaurant, because I didn't want to be fat. <TR>Maybe</TR> I'm not fat to other people, but I think that I'm getting fat. <TR>So</TR> I didn't want to eat too much food. 

At the restaurant there were many kinds of food that my sister liked. We went to a buffet. My sister loves buffets. We rode my father's car and went to the buffet. <TR>On the way to</TR> the buffet, I played my mother's mobile telephone game with my sister. It was very fun. The place where the buffet was is called Home Plus. Home Plus is a kind of shop. When we go to that buffet, it is as if we are going to Home Plus. 

When we reached the buffet, I felt that it might have something fun. I think my sister was very excited when we reached the buffet. My father suggested we sit at a sitting place but I whined that I wanted to sit in another sitting place where there was a sofa, because it looked very comfortable to sit there and eat. <TR>So</TR> we sat where I wanted to sit. At the buffet we ate many kinds of food. Like chocolate cake, cheesecake, chicken, croquette, soup, little cookies, spaghetti, rice cakes in hot sauce (jajang sauce, not spicy sauce), salad, and ice cream. We also ate the garlic bread with the soup. It was very tasty. 

When I ate the chocolate cake and the cheesecake, I was a little happy because they were very sweet so they were tasty. The chocolate cake was cut into slices. I ate one slice of chocolate cake and two slices of cheesecake. The spaghetti was much spicier and yuckier than I thought. <TR>At first</TR>, I thought that croquette would be yucky, but when I ate it, it was very tasty. <TR>But</TR> the croquette's taste was somehow strange too. <TR>Because</TR> the croquette's outside was very sweet, and the inside was very salty. I think that food that tastes sweet and salty at the same time tastes strange. <TR>But</TR> the croquette wasn't so bad. <TR>But</TR> the tastiest food was the chicken. The chicken had no bones and it was softer than most chickens. I was very full because I ate a lot of food. <TR>But</TR> we ate ice cream after the dinner. <TR>So</TR> I didn't eat too much ice cream. <TR>And</TR> we drank green tea and vinegar. The vinegar tasted very yucky, just like I'd heard on Little Fox. <TR>But</TR> my father said that the vinegar tasted good to him. <TR>So</TR> my father drank a little bit more. <TR>But</TR> I like green tea because green tea has no taste like water. <TR>So</TR> I could drink green tea when I was thirsty, and when there was no water. In that buffet there was no water. <TR>So</TR> I had wanted to drink water so much. <TR>And</TR> I'd wanted to drink milk so much, after I ate the chocolate cake and cheesecake. <TR>But</TR> my sister said that she did not mind that because she hates drinking milk. 

<TR>After</TR> we ate dinner, ice cream, and tea, we went out of the buffet and out of Home Plus. We didn't buy anything at Home Plus. <TR>Then</TR> we got in my father's car and came back home. I wished there was milk and water instead of green tea. <TR>Because</TR> I like water more than green tea. <TR>And</TR> when I eat chocolate cake and cheesecake, I need milk. That's why I wished that there was milk at the buffet. <CO><TR>But</TR> many of the dishes were tasty, so it wasn't quite bad. </CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,The sequence of some of the sentences would have been arranged better and more logically.

"509&Saturday, December 4th, 2010, little windy 

<EV>Fish are such mysterious creatures that even a person who knows many things about fish has many things that they do not know</EV>. There are many kinds of fish in the world. Some fish, like coelacanths, are called 'living fossils'. Many people thought that it became extinct five million years ago. <TR>But</TR> in 1938, in South Africa, the coelacanth was discovered. <TR>In fact</TR>, the coelacanth didn't evolve. That is why it is called 'a living fossil'. The coelacanth could crawl on the sea bottom too. There are more fish that didn't evolve. <TR>Such as</TR> the lungfish, arowana, and pirarucu, which is the biggest fresh-water fish in the world, and so on. 

<TR>Almost all of</TR> these fish have lungs so they can breathe air. <TR>Because</TR> these fish didn't evolve. The fish that did evolve do branchial respiration, not air breathing. Fish have an operculum, pectoral fin, dorsal fin, ventral fin, anal fin, caudal fin, and the lateral line. <TR>Of course,</TR> all fish's features are all different. There many kinds of fish's body types too. <TR>Such as</TR> the fusiform, globiform, compressiform, anguliform, depressiform, taeniform, and so on. 

Fish that have the fusiform act very fast. Fish can swim because they have a fin. <TR>Especially</TR> because of the caudal fin. Some fish live in fresh water. <TR>And</TR> other fish live in the sea. There are many kinds of fresh water, such as ponds, reservoirs, dams, valleys, rivers, lakes, streams, and so on. In the pond there are minnows, crucian carp, fighting fish, and so on. <TR>And</TR> in reservoirs, there are loach (미꾸리), mudfish, snakehead, and so on.

The snakehead can crawl on the land in the rain. The snakehead has a lung so it can go out of the water and on the land. Dams are quite deep so there are a lot of big fish in dams. There are carp, catfish, smelt, cornet fish, false minnows, and so on. <TR>And</TR> there are many more fresh water fish in fresh water. <TR>And</TR> there are many endangered fresh water fishes too, such as the siniperca scherzeri, fresh water salmon, hemibarbus mylodon, pseudopungtungia nigra, pungitius sinensis sinensis, cobitis choii, lampetra reissneri, and so on. 

Some fish have been extinct so we cannot see those fish anymore. Fish are beginning to become endangered or extinct because the environment is being contaminated. Or because of dams, the fish cannot lay their eggs. In our country, in the west sea and in the south sea, at low tide the mud flat spreads. In the mud flat, people do a mud pack because if people do a mud pack their skin will become moist. <TR>So</TR> mud packs are good. There are fish in the mud flat too. <TR>Such as</TR> the periophthalmus cantonensis, boleophthalmus pectinirostris, gray mullet, and so on. Gray mullets live in the mud flat because they eat mud. <TR>Actually,</TR> they do not really eat the mud. They eat plant plankton which is inside the mud. 

Some sea fish eat jellyfish, such as the leather fish and the sunfish. <TR>So</TR> these fish are very good for us. <TR>Because</TR> jellyfish are very bad for us. <TR>But</TR> we also eat leather fish just like we eat other fish. The sunfish doesn't have a caudal fin. <TR>So</TR> they swim very slowly. Some fish have suckers. The fish that have suckers also have ventral fins. <TR>But</TR> these ventral fins change into suckers. <TR>So</TR> these fish can suction onto rocks. Some fish are poisonous, such as the lionfish, striped catfish, eagle ray, blowfish, scorpion fish, and so on. 

One fish looks like a horse; a very small horse. <TR>So</TR> this fish is called the sea horse. The male sea horse lays the eggs instead of the female sea horse. Some female fish can turn into a male. It is a callyodon ovifrons. <TR>So</TR> I was amazed when I learned these facts. 

<CO>I wish that there were no fish that were endangered or extinct anymore. </CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,"Due to lack of transitions and statement of purpose in the first paragraph, the essay seemed to lack focus, and seemed like just a random listing of different kinds of fish.",//

<EV>I'd known that there are poisonous animals in the world.</EV> <TR>But</TR> I didn't know that there were poisonous plants in the world. I didn't even think about it. <TR>But</TR> right now, I know that there are poisonous plants in the world. There are many kinds of poisonous animals. <TR>Such as</TR> the poisonous snake, poisonous frog, poisonous spider, poisonous scorpion, poisonous fish, jellyfish, poisonous moth, and so on. <TR>And</TR> there are many kinds of poisonous plants too. <TR>Such as</TR> the aconite, digitalis, belladonna, acacia, celandine, milkweed, nettle, lacquer tree, and so on. 

<TR>And</TR> living things that are poisonous that are not animals or plants are poisonous mushrooms. Many people think that mushrooms are plants. <TR>Because</TR> mushrooms do not move like animals. <TR>But</TR> mushrooms are not plants. Mushrooms are microorganisms. There are many kinds of poisonous mushrooms too. <TR>But</TR> the most representative poisonous mushroom is the fly mushroom. Many people have died by poisonous mushrooms because it is very hard to distinguish between the edible mushrooms and the poisonous mushrooms.

Many poisonous snakes use their teeth to get their prey. There is poison in the snake's teeth. In fact, some poisonous snakes' poisonous teeth are almost five centimeters. The poisonous snake that has teeth that are almost five centimeters can pierce through clothes and shoes. 

Some frogs' poisons are so strong that if people or the poisonous frogs' enemies touch them they will be dead or the body will be paralyzed. Many poisonous frogs have a beautiful skin color to warn that they are poisonous almost all over their body.

One poisonous spider is called the 'tarantula'. Its body (with the legs) is about twenty five centimeters long. <TR>And</TR> it has a lot of fur. <TR>In fact,</TR> the tarantula is endangered, because many people use tarantulas as pets. Some female poisonous spiders eat the male spider.

Some poisonous scorpions could kill a person. <TR>But</TR> most poisonous scorpions' poisons are weaker than the hornet's poison.

<TR>Also</TR>, there are many kinds of poisonous fish too. Some poisonous fish like the Pterois lunulata are very splendid. <TR>But</TR> they have poison thorns. That is why it is a poisonous fish. Most jellyfish live in shallow places (of the sea). <TR>Because</TR> there, there are many kinds of their prey. <TR>In fact</TR>, even if a jellyfish is dead, we have to be careful with that jellyfish. <TR>Because</TR> it's cnidoblast could be still harmful to us. 

The aconite's root, which is also a poisonous plant, has a strong poison too, but these plants can be used to make medicine.

"511&Saturday, November 20th, 2010 sunny day (School arts festival) 

<EV>Today was our school arts festival.</EV> <TR>So,</TR> in the morning when I woke up, I was very tense. <TR>Of course,</TR> I practiced for the school arts festival, before the school arts festival started. I had to practice violin and speaking English for the school arts festival. <TR>So</TR> I practiced many times and if I practice for a long time I become very tired. I thought I would die. <TR>Especially</TR> practicing violin. I was going to play Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons: Spring,"" the first movement. <TR>And</TR> I was going to speak a story about 'The Happy Prince' in English with 'The Happy Prince' pictures. My sister drew those pictures.

In the morning, I ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, and washed my hands and face. <TR>Then</TR> I changed my clothes, combed my hair, and walked to school. When I went to the classroom, I saw many balloon decorations. I was very surprised by the balloon decorations. I sat in my chair. I talked with my other classmates until first period started. 

<TR>During</TR> first period we wrote a letter to our parents. I didn't think that I wrote very well. <TR>And after</TR> we wrote the letter to our parents, we practiced playing the recorder. When we were practicing playing the recorder, it was second period. <TR>And after</TR> second period, we wandered through the school. We went to the first floor and then we went to the second floor, watching every 독서신문 that we and the other children who went to this school (Yongin Yidong Elementary School (my school)) made. Some 독서신문 were well-made 독서신문, and some were not. <TR>But</TR> we didn't go to the third floor. 

When we went back to the class, I saw my mother and my father sitting in two of my classmates' chairs. <TR>So</TR> I wondered how my classmates would sit in their chairs. The time when we wandered through the school and met my mother and my father was third period. I waited until fourth period came, because during fourth period, it was the school arts festival. As I waited for fourth period, (the school arts festival) my heart was beating faster, because I were very nervous. 

<TR>Finally</TR> the school arts festival began! When the school arts festival began, my heart was beating so fast that I thought that I would die. My classmate, whose name is ‘종환’ (one of my boy classmates), and another on of my classmates, whose name is ‘현희' (one of my girl classmates) were our class school arts festival chairpersons. They stood at the end of the front door. They were the people who told us and our parents what's first and what's next and what's next after that. 

<TR>First</TR> was the welcoming address. <TR>And</TR> then it was time to play our recorders. All of us children played the recorders. <TR>And</TR> then the chorus performed. We all sang a song about '참 좋은 말’. <TR>And</TR> then three girls sang. The song was about a corpulent fellow (fatty). <TR>And</TR> then it was hapkido. One of my boy classmates, whose name is '윤서,' did the hapkido. To me, he was very good at hapkido. <TR>And</TR> then it was sign language. Four girls did sign language to a song. <TR>And</TR> then it was my turn. I spoke in English about the story of 'The Happy Prince'. <TR>At first,</TR> I trembled because I was nervous. <TR>But</TR> as I spoke and spoke, it became easier to speak. <TR>And then,</TR> one of my girl classmates sang a song about '넬라판타지아‘. <TR>And then</TR> three boys played the recorder. I thought that playing the recorder was not a talent because we all could play the recorder. <TR>And then</TR> one of my boy classmates, whose name is ’진오,’ played the melodion. <TR>And then</TR> two of my boy classmates, whose names are ‘재완’ and ‘성용,‘ played the ocarina. <TR>And then</TR> my other boy classmate, whose name is ’민성‘, played the guitar. He played '학교 종일 땡땡땡’ and '로망스‘. <TR>And then</TR> my boy classmate spoke in English about his dream. <TR>And then</TR> I played Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons: Spring"" (the first movement) on the violin. <TR>And</TR> the school arts festival continued. <TR>And then</TR>0 we all did sign language to a song. The song title was '어머니 은혜’. <TR>After</TR> we did sign language, we hugged our parents. <TR>And then</TR> the last thing of the school arts festival was the 끝인사. <TR>And after</TR> the 끝인사, the school arts festival was over. 

<TR>Before</TR> we left the class, my teacher gave me and my classmates pencil cases and chocolate pies, which are also called 'Twinkies'. I love Twinkies very much. <TR>And then</TR> I went down the stairs with my parents. <TR>Because</TR> I studied in school at the second floor. <TR>And then</TR> we went to the school yard where my father had parked the car in the school yard. We went inside the car with my school bag, indoor shoe bag, violin, and 'The Happy Prince' picture. My father drove the car and we went home. 

<CO>This year's school arts festival was not bad. I wish that the next school arts festival will be fun too.</CO>

"512&Friday, November 12th, Sunny (My birthday)

<EV>On November 10th, 2000, a baby who was me was born.</EV> <TR>So,</TR> Wednesday, November 10th was my birthday. It was my tenth birthday. <TR>But</TR>, I didn't have a birthday party with my friends, because I didn't want to invite any of my friends. <TR>So,</TR> I had a birthday party with my family, except my father. <TR>Because</TR> my father had not returned from his company, when we had the birthday party. 

On Wednesday, at four o' clock p. m, my mother told me to tell her what I wanted to eat, and I said I wanted to eat triangular gimbap, but my sister said that triangular gimbap is not food associated with a birthday party. <TR>And</TR> she said that we should eat some kind of food that could only be eaten during a birthday party, like a cake. <TR>So,</TR> I thought and thought, but I couldn't decide what we should eat. We decided to eat some chocolate cake. My sister had given me a present before my birthday. My sister gave me the present on Sunday. My sister gave me a strawberry-shaped soap. The soap size was about the size of a quail egg. She didn't wrap the soap with wrapping paper. She just gave me the soap. As she gave me the soap, she said, ""Don't tell me to give you a present at your birthday."" <TR>And so</TR> I didn't talk about the present to my sister. 

I went to the music academy at five o' clock and went back home at six o' clock. When I went back home only my sister was home. My mother was at church. <TR>So</TR> I waited for my mother to return. As I waited for my mother I saw a letter on the table. It was my birthday letter. One of them was my mother's letter and the other letter was my sister's. In my mother's letter, my mother called me '애교둥이‘ which means someone who says cute things or behaves cutely. My mother's letter was very lovely. In my sister's letter, there were words like ""happy birth...,"" ""happy bi...,"" and ""happy birthd."" There was no ""happy birthday."" <TR>Because</TR> she seemed to be shy to write that. 

When my mother returned home, it was 9:10. My mother and my sister celebrated my birthday. We turned off the light and lit a birthday candle. <TR>After</TR> my mother and my sister had celebrated my birthday, we ate a little bit of cake. It was chocolate cake. The cake was a little small. <TR>And after</TR> that we ate dinner. The dinner was boned rib and seaweed soup. I like boned rib. <TR>So,</TR> my mother had bought boned rib for me and my sister. The dinner was very nice. I was very full. <TR>And</TR> after we ate the delicious dinner, my father returned from his company. It was about ten o' clock. My father had bought ‘오뜨,’ which is a kind of bread. I like 오뜨 just as my sister likes it because I like chocolate bread and 오뜨 is chocolate bread. <TR>But</TR> not only had my father bought me 오뜨, but he had also bought me Hershey's chocolate. I like Hershey's chocolate very much. It was a nutty chocolate. 

I had asked my father to buy me socks that are a bright color. <TR>Because</TR> almost all my socks are black. <TR>And so</TR> I had to choose what to wear. <TR>But</TR> my father had bought me 오뜨 and Hershey's chocolate instead of socks, because he forgot about that. <TR>But</TR> I had also forgotten about the socks too. <TR>So,</TR> I didn't say any word to my father about the socks. I ate one 오뜨. It was very delicious. My sister did too. <TR>And</TR> I ate two Hershey's chocolates too. The Hershey's chocolate was very delicious too. <TR>And</TR> then my sister and I ate cake with my father. <TR>Because</TR> the cake was small the cake was almost gone. There was only about one slice of cake left. 

I rested for a minute and then I studied Chinese on the computer. My Chinese tutor's name is Lulu. She is twenty years old. I told her that today is my birthday. <TR>So</TR>, she said happy birthday. <TR>And</TR> she made me listen to the happy birthday music while we listened to music as usual. <TR>During</TR> the Chinese lesson, I showed her the Hershey's chocolate (nutty chocolate). <TR>And</TR> she said that she wanted to eat chocolate because she likes chocolate very much in Chinese language. I said that I liked chocolate very much too and I ate the chocolate. <TR>Of course,</TR> it was very delicious. 

<TR>After</TR> I finished my Chinese study, I brushed my teeth and washed my face and slept. <TR>And</TR> one day, my father remembered the socks, so he bought them for me, and I said thank you. 

<CO>I wish that next year's birthday would be more interesting. </CO>",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,4,::,"Some grammar and language issues made it difficult to follow sometimes, but overall I had no problem envisioning what happened.",//
"513&Monday, November 1st, Sunny (Mulhyanggi Arboretum)

<EV>Last Sunday, I went to Mulhyanggi Arboretum that was in O-SAN with my family and my friend 해영‘s family.</EV> We went to Mulhyanggi Arboretum, because since I had a cold and so did my sister, (she still has a cold now) we needed fresh air. <TR>And</TR> in Mulhyanggi Arboretum, there was a lot of fresh air. <TR>But</TR> I didn't want to go to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum. <TR>Because</TR> I thought that place called Mulhyanggi Arboretum would be very boring. <TR>And</TR> my sister also had not wanted to go to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum. <TR>So</TR>, my father let my friend 해영’s family go to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum with my family. <TR>So,</TR> last Sunday, in the afternoon, we waited for my friend 해영's family to arrive at the church. <TR>And</TR> when they arrived at church, we rode in the car and we went to the Mulhyanggi Arboretum. 

It was a little far from the church, but not too far. When we arrived at the Mulhyanggi Arboretum, we bought skewered chicken and two bottles of cold water. <TR>But</TR> I didn't buy the skewered chicken. My older sister and my friend 해영 bought it. <TR>Because</TR> I had no appetite. <TR>And besides,</TR> the skewered chicken was very long and we didn't have enough money. We first went to a hill and saw a pond and the cattails, reeds, water lilies, flame grasses, water hyacinths and lots of kinds of plants that live in or out of the pond. <TR>And</TR> we accidentally saw one frog swimming in the water and went out to the water. I didn't see many frogs so I was amazed. We played with the frog with a stick and I said, ""Let's stop tormenting the frog."" <TR>And</TR> my friend 해영 agreed. 

<TR>Then</TR> we went inside some kind of small place, and in there, we saw beetles and stag beetles. I was amazed when I saw beetles and stag beetles because I had never seen them before. <TR>Because</TR> beetles and stag beetles in Korea are all endangered. <TR>While</TR> we were looking at something amazing, I began to get a stomachache. <TR>But</TR> I endured my stomachache. 

We went somewhere inside and I saw a feature about the inside of trees. My friend 해영 saw it too. The inside of the trees were all different. I was amazed by the inside of the trees too. <TR>Then,</TR> we saw a video that was about the four seasons. <TR>First</TR>, it was about spring and many flowers had blossomed and bugs were flying in all directions. <TR>And then</TR> it was about summer. The grass was all green and more bugs were flying. <TR>And</TR> then it was about autumn. Things were all red and brown. <TR>And </TR> the bugs, like red dragonflies, were flying. <TR>And then</TR> it was about winter. The trees' leaves had all fallen down and snow came from the sky. The snow covered the grass and the snow was on the tree branches too. <TR>And</TR> winter began to become spring and the snow all melted. <TR>And</TR> the video ended. 

<TR>While</TR> we watched the video, I heard music. The music was very touching. I like touching music. <TR>After</TR> we watched the video, we went to other places where small animals were. We saw stag beetles again. <TR>And</TR> I saw another small creature that I didn't know. <TR>Then,</TR> we went to another place that was a hearing place. If I got closer to something that had a button and pressed the button, I could hear lots of sounds like water, and many kinds of birds and insects. These sounds were somehow amazing to me. I don't know why, but these sounds sounded good to me. <TR>But</TR> my stomachache became worse, so I asked my mother if there was a restroom. My mother found one and she told me to go to the restroom with my father. <TR>So,</TR> I went to the restroom with my father. <TR>But</TR> even though I went to the restroom, and tried to make my stomachache disappear, my stomachache didn't disappear. 

<TR>In fact,</TR> I began to feel weaker than my family and my friend 해영's family. We went to the Chinese restaurant and ate some jajangmyeon and sweet and sour pork and so on. <TR>After</TR> eating, we went to our home.

"514&Wednesday, October 20th, very cold. (Car)

<EV>The car, which is also called an automobile, is a machine that takes us where we want to travel.</EV> We use the car when we go to our relative's, or when we go to the museum, restaurant, airport, store, home, and so on. There are many people who have a car. <TR>But</TR> long ago, there were no cars, because long ago, there were no machines and cars are machines. <TR>But</TR> in 1885, a man named Karl Benz (1844~1929) invented the car. <TR>But at that time</TR>, the car looked different from how it looks now. The seat was like a bench, and the wheels looked even bigger than now. 

Only adults can drive cars, because children like me are too young to learn how to drive. People start to learn how to drive when they are in university. Cars have headlights, so when it is dark like night, using their headlights, people can see in front of the car and can drive more safely. <TR>And</TR> cars have wheels so they can move and drive. 

There are many kinds of cars, such as battery-powered cars, natural-gas powered cars, solar-powered cars, water-powered cars, gasoline-powered cars, and so on. In our country, we use many natural gas and gasoline cars. <TR>Mostly</TR>, there are many natural gas cars and gasoline cars, because they are convenient. My father's car is a natural gas car. I have seen many gas cars and gasoline cars, but I haven't seen many battery cars. <TR>Because</TR> most battery cars are used in golf courses. The solar car can move when it is sunny, because the solar car uses sun energy. <TR>So,</TR> when it is a rainy day the solar car cannot move, because when it is a rainy day, there is no sun. <TR>But</TR> the good thing is that the car can move without any gas or battery, and it is powered by nature (the sun). It takes a long time for a battery car to be charged, about 7-8 hours. The battery car charges by being plugged in. <TR>And</TR> the water car uses water to fuel the car. Many people try to make a lot of battery cars and solar cars, because natural gas cars like my father's car and gasoline cars could destroy the environment. <TR>But</TR> battery cars and solar cars are environmentally-friendly cars. Natural gas cars and gasoline cars make smoke which is black and smells really bad and could destroy the environment. <TR>But</TR> battery cars and solar cars do not make smoke. That is why natural gas cars and gasoline cars could destroy the environment and why battery cars and solar cars do not destroy the environment. <TR>But</TR> battery cars and solar cars are very expensive, because it is hard to make them. That is why there are many natural gas cars and gasoline cars, because they are cheaper than the battery cars and the solar cars. Making natural gas cars and gasoline cars is even easier than making battery cars and solar cars. 

<TR>So</TR>, I wish that making battery cars and solar cars were not hard and not expensive. <TR>In fact</TR>, the smallest car in the world is a water car. It is like a toy car, but if that toy car werel big like a real car, it might be a real water car. The water car is so amazing to me, because the water car uses water to move the car. I want to ride in a real water car. <TR>And</TR> I want to ride in a battery car and a solar car. <TR>And</TR> I wish that there were many battery cars or solar cars so the environment will not be destroyed. <CO><TR>And</TR> I wish that using battery cars and solar cars were very convenient. I wish in the future, there will only be cars that are environmentally-friendly.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Some grammar and language issues but overall this was fine.,//
"515&October 13th, Wednesday, a little sunny (autumn)

<EV>Autumn is one of the four seasons.</EV> Autumn is a cool season. <TR>And</TR> the spring is warm. <TR>And</TR> the summer is hot. <TR>And</TR> the winter is cold. <TR>But</TR> I like winter the best. <TR>Because,</TR> in the winter, snow falls from the sky and I like snow very much. <TR>And</TR> in the winter there are no mosquitoes like in the summer and I hate mosquitoes very much. <TR>And since</TR> the winter is cold, when it is cold, I feel the coldness and it is fun. <TR>And</TR> I almost hate the autumn because I think that the autumn is very boring. 

<TR>But since</TR> today is an autumn day, I will tell you about autumn. In autumn, the maple leaves become a red color. <TR>And</TR> the ginkgo leaves become a yellow color. <TR>And</TR> fruits like apples, pears, persimmons and so on grow in the autumn. <TR>And</TR> in the autumn, the leaves will fall because of the wind. Fall is cool because of the wind. That is why the leaves fall down, and in the winter, most of the trees will lose all their leaves. <TR>And</TR> my father and my birthdays are in the autumn too. My birthday is in November and my father's birthday is in August according to the lunar calendar. My birthday is about one month later (November 10th). My birthday is in the autumn, almost winter. At that time it is very cold for autumn. That is why the autumn is almost winter. In autumn, there is Chuseok for our country. It is on August 15th according to the lunar calendar. Other countries that are in Africa or in cold places like the Arctic and Antarctica don't have autumn. Only temperate regions like Korea have autumn. 

Autumn is the time to harvest rice. In Korea, long ago in the spring, the people planted rice and in the summer, the rice would grow with the weeds. <TR>So, during</TR> the summer the people would pick the weeds. <TR>And</TR> when it was autumn, the people would harvest the rice. In autumn, the winter birds like wild geese come to Korea, while the summer birds like the swallow fly away from Korea. The winter birds come to Korea when it is autumn in Korea, and they start their lives in the autumn and live in Korea until begins to get warmer (during the spring). <TR>And then</TR> they go to another place that is cool. <TR>And</TR> summer birds return to Korea.<TR> And</TR> they start their lives in the spring and go to a warmer place when it is cold. <TR>But</TR> some of the birds live in Korea all of the four seasons, like the sparrow and the magpie.

In the autumn, we wear long-sleeves and long pants. <TR>But</TR> if it is very hot, we wear short-sleeves and shorts instead of long-sleeves and long pants. <TR>And</TR> if it is very cold, we wear jackets. <TR>And</TR> the sky in autumn looks the highest, and looks even more blue, so I think that the sky in autumn is the most beautiful of all the seasons. I like to play outside in autumn, because autumn is cool, and summer is hot. <TR>And</TR> in the winter I will play with snow. I like autumn when the weather is sunny with a cool wind. I like to play outside during this kind of weather. 

In the autumn, bugs like red dragonflies and so on start their lives. <TR>And</TR> in the autumn, the animals search for food, before the winter comes. <TR>Because,</TR> since the winter is very cold, during the winter there is no more food for them. <TR>Because</TR> the cold season makes the animals' food die or disappear. <TR>But</TR> not all of the living things that animals eat die. Some of the plants live even during the winter, even though the winter is very cold. Like pine trees or fir trees. 

I am so lucky that I am a human. <TR>Because,</TR> in the autumn, the animals are busy every year. <TR>And</TR> humans have many foods even during the winter. <TR>So,</TR> humans don't need to be busy every year. <TR>Of course,</TR> humans have to study. 

<TR>But nowadays, because of</TR> global warming, the autumn can be too hot, sometimes. <TR>And</TR> in September, people have to wear short-sleeves and shorts. <TR>Because, nowadays,</TR> the weather in September is very hot, like summer, even though it is autumn. <TR>So</TR> I am very worried about global warming. Global warming could melt the ice in the Arctic and Antarctica and the polar bears and the penguins would lose their homes. <TR>And because</TR> the ice would melt, whole islands would become flooded. <TR>And</TR> the typhoons and the rain would be stronger and make floods. 

We should hurry to solve this problem. I know how we should solve the problem. We should turn off the light switches that are on when nobody is using the room. <TR>And</TR> we should turn off the computer and television at night when nobody is using them. <TR>And</TR> we should turn off the faucet when nobody is using the water. If we do these things, the earth will become cooler and the polar bears and the penguins will find their homes and the autumn will be cooler too. 

<CO>I wish that global warming would have never happened. </CO>

"516&October 10th, Sunday, sunny (수련회)

<EV>From October 7th-8th, which was Thursday-Friday, I went to a retreat, because I had signed up to go there, just like all my classmates who are in class 1 of the fourth grade like me.</EV> <TR>And</TR> my other classmates in classes like class 2 and class 3 also signed up to go to the retreat like me and all my classmates. <TR>And</TR> not only the fourth grade was allowed to go to the retreat. The fifth grade was also allowed to go to the retreat. <TR>So,</TR> classes one, two, and three of the fifth grade also signed up to go to the retreat like us. 

<TR>Before</TR> I went to the retreat, I packed the things that I would need while I was at the retreat, such as comfortable clothes, short-sleeve shirts, shorts, sandals, running shoes, socks, underwear, a towel, a sponge bag, some snacks, car sickness pills for nausea, and so on. 

<TR>After</TR> I packed, I ate breakfast and brushed my teeth and washed my face. <TR>And</TR> I changed my clothes, combed my hair, and I walked to school, carrying my bag that had everything that I needed for the trip. When I reached school, we waited to go to the retreat and we got on the bus, and we were on our way to the retreat. <TR>On the way</TR> to the retreat, we stopped at the rest area to go to the bathroom or buy something with our money. <TR>Then</TR> we were on our way to the retreat again. <TR>And</TR> I almost fell asleep because I was so sleepy. It took about two and a half hours to reach the retreat center. The place where we were going to play, sleep, and learn was grand and beautiful. 

<TR>First</TR>, we heard from the headmaster about what we were going to do during the retreat. There were many teachers who would teach us and play with us. <TR>But</TR> these teachers were so scary that I almost wanted to go home. <TR>After</TR> we heard everything, we followed our headmaster to the cafeteria and ate lunch. <TR>And after</TR> we ate lunch, we went to the rooms where we would sleep, because the headmaster told us to put our bags in the room where we would sleep and change into short-sleeve shirts and shorts. <TR>So,</TR> we did as the headmaster told us and we gathered again and got in a cable car. 

It was very fun. <TR>But</TR> one of my friends said he was a little scared because we were riding in a cable car and were riding over some kind of high place. <TR>But</TR> I wasn't scared. <TR>Instead,</TR> I thought it was very fun. <TR>So</TR> did my friends (my classmates). <TR>But</TR> while we rode the cable car, our ears felt strange, because we had been in a low place and suddenly had gone to a high place. <TR>And after that</TR>, we played some games and after that, we rode a boat and we paddled with our teacher. We rode on one of three boats. The other two boats were for fourth-grade classes 2 and 3. <TR>After</TR> we rode the boat, we ate dinner and we had a campfire and washed our hands and faces and slept. 

<TR>While</TR> I slept, my classmates heard me snore. I knew this because my classmates told me later. <TR>So</TR> I was very shy and felt ashamed. <TR>And the next day</TR>, when it was six o'clock, my teacher hit my hip to woke me up, even though I was already awake and just lying on the mattress with my eyes closed. <TR>So,</TR> I was even more shy and even more ashamed.

<TR>After</TR> we were all awaken, we lined up and went to the cafeteria and ate breakfast, and after breakfast, we went up the hill to go bobsledding. It was fun too. We rode twice. <TR>And then</TR> we did something that was like training before a battle will happen. <TR>And then</TR> we ate lunch, packed our bags, and we went home. 

<TR>And on the way</TR> home I shared my cookies with one of my classmates. <TR>Then, before</TR> we arrived home, we stopped at the rest area and I went to the restroom and I bought an ice cream, because the ice cream was cold. I was dizzy from riding the bus, and I had to eat something cold. That is why I bought and ate some ice cream. I thought that if I ate something cold, I would not be dizzy anymore. <TR>But</TR> I hadn't been dizzy when we were on our way to the retreat. 

<TR>And then,</TR> when we finally reached the school, my teacher told us to rest for many minutes and to not go anywhere, because we were tired from going to the retreat and had to rest. <TR>And then</TR> we went to school carrying our bags. 

<CO>Going to the retreat was a little tiring and a little fun too. I wonder if I should sign up to go to the retreat next year. <TR>And</TR> I wonder if the next trip (going to the retreat) will be a fun trip or shameful trip or both.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,Good essay.,//
"517&Friday, October 1st, Sunny day (Treasure Island)

<EV>I read a book called ""Treasure Island"", because my mother borrowed ""Treasure Island,"" and my mother told me to read this book.</EV> <TR>And finally</TR>, I finished reading the book. It wasn't so easy for me to read a long story like ""Treasure Island."" It took about six days~one week. The person who wrote this story is Robert Louis Stevenson. <TR>And</TR> he wrote the story because he wanted to let his son hear about an adventure. <TR>At that time,</TR> there weren't as many stories. I knew the story's content. <TR>So</TR>, here, the story will begin now, about the ""Treasure Island."" 

Long ago in the year 1750, a boy named Jim Hawkins was working as an innkeeper. He worked as an innkeeper in a place called the Admiral Benbow with his father, because they were poor. <TR>And one day</TR>, an old seaman came into the Admiral Benbow. He was a tall, strong man with nut-brown hair, and he was pulling his sea chest behind him. He sat down on a chair and ordered a glass of rum. And drank slowly. <TR>And</TR> he asked if there were many customers. <TR>But</TR> Jim's father said no, there were very few customers. <TR>So,</TR> the seaman thought that the Admiral Benbow was a good place to live, and said to call him captain. <TR>But</TR> because the captain almost ruined the Admiral Benbow, Jim Hawkins' father was very upset and looked ill. <TR>So,</TR> late one afternoon, Dr. Livesey came to the Admiral Benbow to see Jim's father, as he lay down feeling ill. While Dr. Livesey told Jim's mother what to do, the captain was drinking lot of rum. <TR>Suddenly</TR>, the captain began to sing: ""Fifteen men on a dead man's chest, Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"". <TR>And one day</TR>, Jim met a seafaring man called Black Dog and when the captain (named Billy Bones) came in from his walk, the two men knew each other and a fight began. <TR>After</TR> the fight, Billy Bones (the captain) ordered some rum, but when Jim returned with the glass of rum, Billy Bones (the captain) was lying on the floor. When Dr. Livesey came to see Jim's father, the doctor said that Billy Bones (the captain) had had a stroke, which is a very dangerous medical condition. <TR>Since</TR> Billy Bones was ill, Dr. Livesey and Jim carried him into the bed. <TR>But</TR> still, Billy Bones asked Jim to bring him some rum. <TR>But</TR> Jim said no. <TR>So,</TR> Billy Bones said to give him one glass of rum. <TR>And</TR> the doctor said that the one glass would not kill him. <TR>So,</TR> Jim got the rum for Billy Bones.<TR> And</TR> he drank a good glass of rum. <TR>And</TR> Jim left the room where Billy Bones was lying down. That night, Jim's father died from his illness. <TR>Time went on</TR>, and Billy Bones was dead from the stroke. It was because of the rum that Billy Bones had a stroke. Jim and Dr. Livesey went to Treasure Island with the squire. <TR>But</TR> the doctor worried that the squire couldn't hold his tough. <TR>And</TR> they were not the only ones who wanted the treasure. <TR>So,</TR> the squire promised not to tell anybody. <TR>But</TR> he did. <TR>And</TR> Hawkins knew that he did, because he read a letter that the squire had written. <TR>Then</TR> they went off to Treasure Island (Jim Hawkins, Dr. Livesey, and Squire Trelawney) with Long John Silver, who had lost his leg, Captain Smollett, and the rest of the seamen. There, at the island, they met Ben Gun and nearly all of the seamen became pirates, because of the treasure. Three of the men stayed on the island and the rest of the men died except Abe Gray and Long John Silver, because they weren't bad. <TR>And because</TR> Ben Gun found the treasure, they shared the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly. Captain Smollett retired from the sea. Gray saved his money, and he's now part owner of a fine, married, and the father of a big family. Ben Gun spent or lost all his money within three weeks and ended up in a small village. <TR>And</TR> this was the end of the story.

"518&Saturday, September 25th, Sunny day (Chuseok)

<EV>Chuseok is a Korean festival day.</EV> Chuseok is the Korean Thanksgiving Day. Chuseok is the day when the full moon rises. <TR>Because</TR> Chuseok is on August 15th, in the lunar calendar. On the 15th of every month in the lunar calendar, the full moon rises up at night instead of another moon (like a crescent (new and old moon) or a half moon). <TR>And</TR> also Chuseok is on August 15th in the lunar calendar. That is why on Chuseok, a full moon rises up at night. <TR>And</TR> August 15th in the solar calendar is the Independence Day of Korea. My family went to our maternal grandmother's house on August 15th in the lunar calendar (on Chuseok). 

<TR>Before</TR> we went to my maternal grandmother's house, I put on my HANBOK, instead of my ordinary clothes because it was Chuseok. We didn't go the day before, even though it is a red day like Chuseok. <TR>Because</TR> we had thought and thought about how much we would sleep or visit. It didn't take as long of a time to reach there as I had thought. When we arrived at my maternal grandmother's house, there were no children (relative children) to play with me inside my maternal grandmother's house. My aunt said that they had gone to play outside on the playground. <TR>While</TR> I was waiting for my relatives (the children), I read a comic book that I had brought from my house to read at my maternal grandmother's house. <TR>And</TR> I ate cookies while I read a comic book and waited for them. <TR>Finally,</TR> they returned. <TR>And</TR> I saw something that they were carrying. It was some kind of toy bird. The toy bird was almost the same size as my hands. <TR>But</TR> it was not an ordinary toy bird. If I put the toy bird's beak on the end of my finger (not on my nail), it did not fall down. It stayed on the end of my finger, like it was flying. Maybe it could stay on the end of my finger because the toy bird's body was almost as heavy as my hands. <TR>So,</TR> it could make it be horizontal. We played with the toy bird, and after we played, we ate dinner. I read my comic book while I ate dinner. My sister did too. And after dinner, we played 'hide and seek'. <TR>And then</TR> we played 'the Mugunghwa flower has blossomed' (무궁화 꽃이 피었습니다) too. <TR>And</TR> we played more and more (also with my sister too) and we watched television (a drama). The drama was fun too. <TR>And then</TR> we changed our clothes, brushed our teeth, and washed our faces and feet. <TR>But</TR> I couldn't brush my teeth well. <TR>Because</TR> I didn't bring my toothbrush. <TR>So,</TR> I brushed my teeth with my finger. <TR>Then</TR> we lay down to sleep. <TR>But</TR> I went to sleep even later than my relatives, because my sister was watching a drama, so I watched the drama too, even though I was very sleepy and wanted to sleep. <TR>And finally,</TR> I fell asleep. 

In the morning, I woke up even later than my relatives. <TR>Because</TR> I had gone to sleep even later than my relatives. <TR>But</TR> I wanted to play with my relatives even more quickly, so I went outside of the room where I had slept, even though I was still sleepy. My relatives had already eaten breakfast, so I ate my breakfast alone, while my mother, my father, and my sister were in the room where I had slept, still sleeping. <TR>And after</TR> breakfast, I played the cell phone game with my relatives. <TR>And</TR> my aunt asked if anyone wanted to go to my relative 채림's (채림 is the name of one of my children relatives) house. <TR>So,</TR> I said that I wanted to go, and so did 혜원, who is another one of my relatives. <TR>And</TR> my sister said that she was going to 채림's house too (my sister had been awakened). <TR>So</TR>, we went to 채림’s house and there, we rested, while we watched as my sister played a computer game. <TR>And</TR> except my sister, we went to E-mart with my uncle and my aunt. <TR>On the way</TR> to E-mart, me and 원균, who is 채림's younger brother, fought with each other. <TR>So</TR>, we were been scolded by my uncle (채림 and 원균's father). <TR>So</TR>, I was very unhappy. <TR>Because</TR> 원균 had teased me first (calling me 'crazy', even though I had not known) and the fight began. <TR>Because</TR> I was not happy, I sometimes stayed away from my relatives, and I was nearly lost in E-mart. <TR>So,</TR> my uncle had to grab my shirt, so I could not go away from them. <TR>So,</TR> I was even more unhappy, because I could not wander through E-mart wherever I wanted to go, like 채림, 원균, and 혜원. At about one o'clock, we ate hamburgers, and my uncle and my aunt bought what they needed. <TR>But</TR> my mother called my aunt on the phone. <TR>And</TR> said that I had to leave them because visitors were coming to my house. <TR>So,</TR> I was very disappointed. We had decided that we were going at night, but we had to go home in the afternoon! <TR>And</TR> my mother came to E-mart and I followed her. <TR>Then</TR> we got in my father's car and then we drove home.

<EV>The violin is a string instrument, and string instruments are musical instruments.</EV> The violin has four strings. <TR>In fact</TR>, the sound comes from the violin's four strings. High and low sounds can be controlled at the upper end of the violin. Learning the violin is harder than learning the piano, so most children learn the piano. <TR>But</TR>, my mother especially wanted me to learn the violin, instead of piano. I first started learning the violin when I was eight years old (three years ago). <TR>And</TR> I first learned the violin at church. <TR>Then,</TR> I learned the violin at school. <TR>But</TR> because I was so tired carrying the heavy violin, I learned the violin at home, when I was nine years old. <TR>And</TR> I learned the violin at the music academy when I was ten years old. <TR>And</TR> I also started to learn the piano at ten years old too (at home). When I had learned the violin at church, the violin was very hard to me. <TR>But</TR>, now, it was not too hard to me. <TR>But</TR> vibrato is very hard to me. Vibrato is shaking your hand while you play the violin. <TR>In fact,</TR> vibrato is the last part of learning the violin. <TR>So,</TR> I am learning the last part of the violin (vibrato). <TR>But</TR> I haven't been learning vibrato for a long time. Maybe one or two weeks? <TR>Anyway,</TR> my music teacher (the music academy music teacher) said that learning vibrato takes a long~ time. <TR>About</TR> 1~2 years. <TR>So,</TR> I was a little disappointed because it takes a long time. <TR>Because</TR> vibrato is very hard. <TR>Now,</TR> I am practicing how to do vibrato (shaking the hand like violinists). <TR>Maybe</TR> I'll finish learning vibrato when I am five years old, or six years old. I have seen only a few children that learn the violin like me. <TR>And</TR> I saw that they were at a lower level than me. Some children were learning only Do~ Rae~ Mi~ Fa~ So~ La~ Ti~. These were very easy to me. <TR>But,</TR> I knew they were important too. <TR>And</TR> some children were learning 'Suzuki 2', and I am learning 'Suzuki 4'! 

The violin was first invented at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The violin was invented even later then the viola (the viola is almost the same as the violin, but bigger than the violin). The violin uses treble clef, and the viola uses alto clef. Koreans started to played the violin in 1910. <TR>In fact</TR>, long ago, the violin's bow looked like a bow that is used for archery, so the people called itl a 'bow'. <TR>But nowadays</TR>, the bow is a straight line (it doesn't look like an archery bow, but people still call it a 'bow'). A violinist is a person who is good at violin. <TR>Of course</TR>, all violinists learn up to vibrato. Violinists have been learning the violin even longer than me. <TR>And</TR> they play the violin while doing vibrato. <TR>Doing</TR> vibrato with short musical notes (like quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes) is harder than doing it with long musical notes (like half notes, dotted half notes, and whole notes). <TR>And even</TR> to most violinists, it is very hard to do vibrato with short musical notes. <TR>So</TR>, my teacher in the academy said that she was also learning how to do vibrato with a short musical note. <TR>But</TR> some violinists that are very, very good at violin can do vibrato with a short musical note. <TR>So,</TR> I want to be like those violinists (doing vibrato with a short musical note). I wonder how a violinist can do vibrato with a short musical note. I know many violinists have practiced many times. <TR>And</TR> did not make mistakes. <TR>And in fact</TR>, I heard that when violinists hear themselves play, because the music is so beautiful they close their eyes and appreciate the music and don't make any mistakes. <TR>So,</TR> I also want to play the violin with no mistakes like violinists. <TR>However,</TR> my dream isn't to become a violinist. My dream is to become a doctor. <TR>But,</TR> I want to be a doctor who is good at violin. 

My mother said that if a patient listens to beautiful music, their illness goes away quickly. <TR>So,</TR> I want to play the violin for my patients. <TR>So</TR> their illness will go away quickly. To be that kind of doctor is my dream. I am very thankful for my mother. <TR>Because</TR>, my mother made me learn the violin, and made me good at violin. When I was in first grade and in second grade, I had hated learning the violin so much that I wanted to break the violin, but now, I changed my mind. <TR>So,</TR> I decided that I will not give up learning the violin. <TR>Because</TR>, if I give up, I will not be good at violin. <TR>But</TR> I want to be good at violin. <CO><TR>So</TR>, I will learn and learn up to vibrato. <TR>And</TR> I can't give up the violin. <TR>Because</TR>, I am barely learning vibrato.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,"Overall it was good, but sometimes the ideas were repetitive.

<EV>On Friday, September 4th at dawn, a typhoon passed through here (GIONG-GI-DOE).</EV> <TR>So while</TR> I was sleeping, I was awakened by the sound of the wind: the typhoon. I was so scared by that sound, that I went to my mother and my father's room and slept with my father. My mother was out at church (praying at dawn). When my mother returned from church, I awoke again. <TR>Then</TR> I slept again. When I woke up again, it was morning. I ate breakfast and brushed my teeth and washed my face. <TR>Then</TR> I changed my clothes and combed my hair. <TR>Then</TR> I walked to school. <TR>On my way</TR> to school, I saw a tree that had fallen during the typhoon. It was so amazing to me. <TR>And on my way</TR> home, I showed my friends the fallen tree. In Korea, the typhoon had first formed in CHOONG-CHUNG-DOE (another province besides GIONG-GI-DOE). So, the typhoon had gotten away from CHOONG-CHUN-DOE and passed through GIONG-GI-DOE. And on Friday, September 4th, in the afternoon, the typhoon had gotten away from GIONG-GI-DOE. And it had gone to GANG-ONE-DOE (another province besides GIONG-GI-DOE). In fact, even though the typhoon had ended, the typhoon had formed in Korea again. But this time, the typhoon had not formed in GIONG-GI-DOE again. It had formed in the south of Korea, in places like JON-LA-DOE, GIONG-SANG-NAM-DOE, or Jeju island, which is the biggest island in Korea. <TR>So,</TR> I was very relieved. <TR>In fact,</TR> not all countries call these storms typhoons. Only in the Pacific are they called typhoons. In the Atlantic they are called hurricanes. <TR>And</TR> in the Indian they are called cyclones. <TR>And</TR> in Australia, the Australian people call the typhoon wliywliy. On Friday, September 4th, a typhoon called Kompasu formed. Kompasu is one of the typhoon's names (the Japanese people named the typhoon). ""Kompasu"" means compass in the Japanese language. <TR>Here,</TR> Korean people have named typhoons: Kaemi (ant), Nari (lily), Changmi (rose) Sudal (otter), Noru (roe deer), Chebi (swallow), Noguri (raccoon), Koni (swan), Megi (catfish), and Nabi (butterfly). <TR>And</TR> in North Korea (I live in South Korea), the people have named typhoons: Kirogi (wild goose), Toraji (balloon flower), Kalmaegi (seagull), Meami (cicada), Meari (echo), Sonamu (pine tree), Podul (willow), Pongsona (garden balsam), Mindulle (dandelion), and Nalgae (wing). There are many kinds of typhoon names, I thought. Typhoons are so strong that they can break trees and trees fall because of the typhoons. In fact, in our country, three people died from the typhoon (Kompasu). <tR>So,</TR> I was so amazed, and surprised too. I wonder how these people died from the typhoon (Kompasu). I thought that the people died because of the falling trees and streetlights. <TR>But, in fact,</TR> in the middle was the eye of the typhoon, where there is no wind, clouds, or rain. The eye of a typhoon could be up to fifty kilometers wide. Typhoons might be even stronger because of global warming. If the Earth had an even higher temperature, the typhoons could be even stronger too. <TR>Because of</TR> global warming, the winds would be even stronger and there might be even more clouds, and the rains could be even stronger than before too. That is why I think that we have to save the Earth, so there will not be as many Typhoons. I think that we have to save electricity. <TR>For example,</TR> I think that we should turn off the switch when nobody is using the light. Or, I think that we have to turn off the light, when it is bright like in the afternoon. <TR>Because</TR>, in the afternoon, the day is so bright, that we don't need electric light. <TR>And</TR> I think that we should turn off the computer when nobody is using the computer for a long time, like at night or dawn. <TR>So</TR>, if we do all of these things, I think that there will be less typhoons. <TR>And</TR> if a typhoon forms and makes a flood it is good to be ready by preparing food. We should prepare many foods, so we don't get hungry. <TR>Of course</TR>, we should also prepare drinking water too. <TR>So</TR>, it is very good and important to be prepared. If not, we could starve during the floods. <TR>And</TR> also thirsty too. We should wait untill the flood ends. <CO>I wish that typhoons would not form often.</CO>",::,2,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,"In general, you don't want to put that much text into a single paragraph.

Or, they might have ridden a horse to send the message. It would have been very hard for me (when I think about how people sent messages long ago), so I realized nowadays, computers are very good for sending messages, because it is very comfortable to send messages, and we don't need to walk.

I am very thankful for the person who invented the computer. The person who invented the computer was Charles Babbage. He was born in England in the year 1791, on December 26th. Charles Babbage invented the computer in about the year 1830. There are many different kinds of computers, such as the personal computer, laptop (notebook computer), palm-sized computer, super computer, and workstation computer, which is like a personal computer. The workstation computer is a personal computer which is used in workstations. In our house, we have two computers: a personal computer and a laptop (notebook computer). We bought the personal computer first. Maybe we used it for about five years. <TR>Then</TR> we bought a laptop (notebook computer) last year (2009). <TR>So</TR>, in my house, the laptop (notebook computer) is faster than the personal computer.

We sometimes bring the laptop (notebook computer) to our relatives'. <TR>So,</TR> I played on my computer with my relatives (children) when we brought the laptop (notebook computer) to my relatives. 

Computer can be good for people and bad for us too. Computers can calculate much faster than people. Computers can calculate even things that people cannot calculate. <TR>And with</TR> computers we can buy things that we want to buy. <TR>So, nowadays,</TR> we don't need to go to the market to buy things that we want to buy. <TR>And</TR> with the computer, we can find out about things that we do not know. <TR>But</TR> computers can also show minors like me violent things. <TR>And</TR> many children can become addicted to many computer games. <TR>So,</TR> I think that we have to reduce these computer problems. <TR>Maybe</TR> we should not make any computer games.

"525&<EV>Last Wednesday, my mother and I went to Hong-chun, which was in Gang-won-doe.</EV> We had decided to meet our relatives there, and we had decided we would play and sleep there. My older sister and my father didn't come with us. My sister had to go to her art and studying academy (math) and my father had to go to his company. <TR>So</TR> I was a little disappointed because they couldn't come with us. We had decided to sleep there about two nights and three days. I knew that after three days, we would be a part of each other. 

<TR>At first</TR> when we carried our luggage and were in my uncle's car and drove to Hong-chun with my mother and my uncle, I was very happy and couldn't wait until we arrived and could meet each other. <TR>But since</TR> Gang-won-doe is far, far away from my home (Giang-gi-doe), when we were in my uncle's car, I was very bored, dizzy, and hot. I slept inside the car. We stopped the car at the rest area in Ga-piang and my mother bought a small walnut-flavored cake in the size and shape of a walnut and I bought an ice cream and my uncle didn't buy anything. <TR>Then</TR> we continued to go to Hong-chun. 

When we got there I was very disappointed. The room didn't seem as beautiful as I had imagined. The place that we were going to sleep in had only three rooms; one room was a kitchen that led into the living room, and the other room was where we would sleep and play inside, and the other room was a bathroom where we took our shower. All the rooms except the bathroom were covered with smell. Something like mold. <TR>But</TR> I didn't care about the smell. The place where we were going to play had one sofa and one TV. <TR>And</TR> the bathroom was very small. 

I waited and waited for my relatives until my relatives arrived in Hong-chun. I was outside in front of the pond, siting on the rock, while I waited for my relatives. <TR>Soon,</TR> they arrived with the one year old baby. It was not my aunt's baby. It was another person's baby. <TR>But</TR> that person was so busy. She was working as a nurse. <TR>So</TR> she let my aunt take care of the baby instead of her. I thought that the baby was very dirty because the baby driveled, urinated, and he even let out a green poo. It was so dirty that I didn't even want to see. <TR>But</TR> 채림, who is one of my relatives (children), and 원균, who is 채림's younger brother, liked the baby because they thought that the baby was cute. It wasn't very cute to me. 

We went inside and I played with 채림 and 원균. But 원균 and I started to fight. We fought because 원균 called me ""crazy'' even though it was the first time he met me. <TR>So,</TR> I was so angry that I kicked him and he hit me back. That is why the fight began. 원균 hit me and I hit him back several times. <TR>In fact,</TR> he poked and pinched my leg so hard (my right leg), that I had a bruise on my leg, which is still on my leg. <TR>Then,</TR> ""Stop fighting you two!'' We heard my mother's voice. She was shouting, and so we calmed down. 

<TR>Then,</TR> we ate lunch. The lunch was boned rib (of pork). It was very delicious, because I like salty things. The boned rib (of pork) tasted salty, which was just the taste that I wanted. <TR>After</TR> the lunch, we played and read comic books that I had brought, and we went to the valley. <TR>There,</TR> flying bugs circled around me, so I was very angry with those bugs. We played in the valley with a tube, so it was very fun because of the tube. We rode our tubes and played with water, splashing. The water was a little cold but not cold enough. 

Two weeks before that, my mother, my sister, and I had already gone to Gang-won-doe (another place in Gang-won-doe, not Hong-chun). There, water had been very, very cold so that when I first put my foot into the water, I almost drew back my foot from the water. There, water had been much colder than Hong-chun's valley water. That is why I thought that Hong-chun's valley water was not cold enough. I pulled 채림's tube, while 채림 lay on the tube, pretending to sleep. <TR>Then,</TR> we ate cookies while we rested, and watched my aunt rowing the tubes and playing in the water. 

Then after we rested and ate all of the cookies that we had packed, we went inside the cold water again. <TR>But,</TR> we just played a little and then we left the valley. We drove back to Hong-chun, where we were going to sleep. When we were back there, we took off our clothes and took a shower. My relatives had brought shampoo and soap. <TR>After</TR> we took a shower and changed into new clothes, we played with each other and 채림, 원균, and I read comic books. <TR>Then</TR> it was dinner time. We ate curry and rice for dinner. The dinner was very delicious to me. <TR>While</TR> we ate dinner, my uncle let out a hiccup. I told my uncle how he could stop his hiccups. I said that uncle had to say the names of fruits that he liked (five kinds) and gulp once. <TR>So</TR> he did as I said and amazingly, it worked! His hiccups had stopped. <TR>Even though</TR> I already knew that if we say the names of five different fruits we liked and gulped once the hiccups would stop, it was very amazing to me too. <TR>In fact,</TR> my sister had told me how to stop the hiccups. 

<TR>After</TR> dinner, we ate cookies. 원균 was selfish. He didn't give me and 채림 many cookies. He said that the cookies were his because the person who had cookies was 원균. He gave us only one cookie. <TR>So</TR> we told my mother about it and she said to 원균 to share the cookies with us. <TR>Then</TR> we played ""끝말잇기'' and 원균 was very angry because he lost in the end. <TR>Then,</TR> we brushed our teeth. <TR>And</TR> we slept where we had played. The baby was with us. My aunt, my uncle, and my mother were with us too. <TR>And</TR> in the living room, only my maternal grandmother was sleeping. <TR>But</TR>, in the middle of the night, or dawn, (at about five o'clock) the baby was crying. <TR>So,</TR> my aunt gave the baby a bottle of milk. It was not ordinary milk. It was powdered milk. <TR>At that time,</TR> I was sleeping. <TR>So</TR> I didn't know at that time. 

<TR>The next day</TR>, I wanted to wake up because my relatives had already woken up, but I was so tired, so I slept more. When I woke up, I checked my hair. My hair was a mess. <TR>So</TR> I combed my hair. We ate breakfast and brushed our teeth. <TR>And</TR> we played and looked at comic books. <TR>Then,</TR> at noon, we went to the river with tubes like the day before (on Wednesday) but unlike yesterday, we even brought our boat tube, and went to the river. Like yesterday, we rode in my uncle and aunt's car. The river was not so far. When we arrived at the river, we rested in the restaurant, because it was very hot. The restaurant was next to the river. We (me, 채림, and 원균) waited for my uncle with my mother, untill my uncle found a place to spread the mat. 

When he found the place to spread the mat we all got our tubes and a boat tube. <TR>But before</TR> I went into the water I did some warming up. <TR>Then, excitedly,</TR> I went into the water. It was very fun. <TR>Because</TR> the water was not so cold like the valley water, even my mother went into the water. We played and rode the tube boat, and we rested and ate some chicken. It was very delicious. We even ate a grilled chicken too. That was very delicious too. <TR>After then,</TR> we went inside the water again. We caught some fish, and splashed water. <TR>But because</TR> we had played in a dangerous place, we were almost swept away by the water because the water was very strong. 채림's sandal was taken off from her foot. I tried to catch it and I almost caught the sandal (twice), but 원균 pulled me and I couldn't catch it. <TR>Even</TR> the adults didn't help us! <TR>So</TR> I was very angry with them. I thought the sandal had gone away, but my uncle got the sandal. <TR>And</TR> we barely escaped from the water. That was very close. <TR>After</TR> we escaped from the water, 원균 said loudly to me, ""Is a sandal more precious than your life?''. <TR>Then</TR> we played with my uncle (only for a short time) and we returned to the home (Hong-chun). We took a shower, changed our clothes, and played and read comic books. <TR>Then</TR> it was dinner time. We decided to have a barbecue outside, but unfortunately it was raining, so we ate our barbecue inside. <TR>After</TR> dinner we played 'Treasure Hunting'. It was fun, but in the end it turned into a boring game. We brushed our teeth and washed our faces. <TR>Then</TR> we slept. 

The next morning, we ate breakfast and played a little and read comic books. Then, we packed our luggage, and said good-bye and went home. I wanted to play a little more but my mother said no.

<EV>Today, my mom gave a cucumber massage to my whole family (that includes my mom, too).</EV> It was because we were all sunburned after going to the beach. I was a little glad because it had been years since I did it last, and if I do it, my skin will be less black (from the sunburn). 
My parents started to cut the cucumbers into thin pieces, and put them on our faces, arms, and legs.

He meets a girl named Anabeth who is a Demogat(Demogats are creatures who have one parent that is a god or goddess, and the other a human). She is very strong and smart. The first part was familiar to me because I already saw that part at school. The next part was a little bit scary because Medusa had a part in it. It was horrible to see many people turn into stone by looking into Medusa's eyes. 
I liked the part where Luke (Hermes's son) and Percy fight to get the lightning because Luke wants to give the lightning to Hades. The real owner is Zeus, and Percy wants to give it to its owner to get rid of the suspicion, since the thief is Luke. <TR>For real,</TR> I liked this the most!

<EV>At school, we had an exam for turning hula-hoop.</EV> We had to turn it for 7 minutes. I didn't worry much because hula-hoop is one of my best sports. The boys went first. We watched them.

I got 227 votes. <TR>And</TR> a guy called A got 156 votes and B got 102 votes. I was so lucky. I felt so amazed by myself. I got 227 votes! I. am. Not.

<EV>A few days ago, we had a relay race contest.</EV> <TR>So</TR> I was very excited!! <TR>But also</TR> nervous too because I was worried about my right foot. 2 weeks ago I got bruise in my right foot while I was having a pillow fight with my friends. <TR>But</TR> I am a really nice runner so I didn’t think I was going to have a serious problem with my right foot.

<TR>After</TR> we heard our teacher’s explanation about the relay race contest we went out immediately.

With the sound of the gunpowder gun 3 classes started running. <TR>Of course</TR> there were more classes but they were divided into two groups randomly. <TR>And</TR> we were in the second group. <TR>And</TR> you know what! We were the 1st at the start! <TR>But</TR> the bad news was that the second runner was a really slow fat guy. He was so slow that if he had raced with a turtle, the turtle would have won. <TR>So because of</TR> that runner we fell halfway behind the 1st class. <TR>Then</TR> it was my turn. <TR>Fortunately</TR> I was able to catch up! <TR>But</TR> the next runner was a short girl so we were a little slower than the 1st class. <TR>But</TR> our class was in the 3rd place! Yes! Yes! Yes~! We shortened 2 seconds. <TR>But</TR> I try to believe that we shorted 2 hours.

weekday so that is the reason I was so happy. Well, that part was the good part but the bad part was 

that my mom couldn't find the train tickets so we had to ride the bus. <TR>And</TR> it took 7 hours. Where do my 

grandparents live? They live in Kwangju. <TR>And</TR> I live in Song-pa-gu in Seoul. <TR>While</TR> we were on the bus I

watched a movie called ‘Now You See Me’ since I was so bored. When we arrived I felt relieved. I felt a

little dizzy too.


My mom and my brother were planning to ride a taxi. <TR>But</TR> the line was so long that I thought it was 

going to take 30 minutes so we just called my uncle and dad to pick us up. <TR>After</TR> waiting a few minutes 

they came. I thought we were going to the house immediately. <TR>But</TR> we were going to a store to buy a 

gift set for grandpa and grandma.


When we arrived at our grandparents' house I was so happy. <TR>And</TR> also my grandparents were very 

happy because we arrived safely. I was hoping to make songpyeon, the half-moon shaped rice cake by myself 

because I really like making songpyeon and eating it. <TR>But!</TR> Sadly they were making jeon(Korean

pancake). When it turned into night I could see the full moon so I wished for me to be smart and for my 

family to be healthy and good. In our grandparents' house they don't have a computer or a game player 

but only a TV. <TR>But</TR> I was still not bored because two little babies were there.

The next day me, my uncles, grandpa, and my dad went to the graveyard. It was a really nice 

day. <TR>So</TR> the graveyard didn't feel scary at all. I felt a little sad for the people in the tomb.

The second thing that is most important thing to me is my money. If there is no money, I will be a poor person. If I don't have any money, then I can't buy anything such as fruits, vegetables, ice-cream, clothes, earrings or electronic gadgets. I will be the one who gets money from others.
The next most important things to me is my family. If there is no family then, I will be lonely and sad. I have to be cared for by others and I am a teenager. <TR>Well</TR>... Teenagers are a little grown up. <TR>But</TR>... I still want to be with my family right now.
The last thing is myself. I am very proud of myself and I am happy about who I am, Cindy. <TR>Also</TR>, I am really satisfied and happy with myself right now. I like to be a fun, happy and satisfied person. HE... HE...

When I was at about 5 or 6 years old, I wanted to be a teacher. No... I wanted to become a princess. I wanted to meet a prince and live happily ever after.
<TR>From</TR> about 7 to 9 years old, I wanted to become a star! <TR>Also</TR>, I wanted to be a doctor, nurse, officer, and teacher!
<TR>And now</TR>, I decided my dream. I mean, I made a decision about my future and adult job. My future adult job is... is... a teacher.
I wanted to become a star but I know that stars have to be talented in voice, body, face and skills. 
<TR>Second,</TR> I wanted to become a doctor. I heard that doctors earn a lot of money but I don't want to and I might not enjoy that job. <TR>Also</TR>, I heard that I need to study hard.
<TR>So,</TR> I forgot about those two fantastic jobs and I want to become a teacher. <TR>More specifically,</TR> I want to become an elementary school teacher. <TR>Now especially,</TR> I want to become an elementary homeroom teacher. My dream is really big and the best thing for me.
Most people have said that I have a special ability. I have good teaching skills! I love teaching and I like students. <TR>So</TR>, I want to become a teacher some day.

I think being rich is really good because that means they worked hard and they lived a successful life. That's good. <TR>However</TR>, I think being a greedy, selfish, and unkind person is not good!

My favorite ice cream flavor is fruit, especially lemon, watermelon, strawberry, mango, and kiwi. I always eat these flavors. <TR>Second,</TR> I can play a lot during the summer. I can go to the ocean and play in the cool water. I will swim in the ocean. I will play with the sand too. I can make a grand sand castle.
I like winter, too. In the winter, there will be a lot of snow in Korea. I like snow. If there is a lot of snow, I can play with it. During winter, I can have fun but it's dangerous to have a snowball fight. I haven't tired it yet because, it's quite difficult to make snowballs. <TR>Also</TR>, I can sled down the icy hill!

Ding- ding! It's morning. Wait... Oh! It's September 30th! My special birthday! I started to take a shower. I started to change my clothes into some very expensive and fantastic clothes. <TR>But</TR>, not a dress! 
It's 10:00 A.M! My friends will be here soon. I invited more than 20 friends. What? Do you think it's too early for a birthday party? No! It takes more than hour from my house to get to the theme park! So, we have to be the fastest people in the world, just for today!
All aboard my car! Great~ Let's go! 30 mins... 40 minutes later... 1 hour later... 2 hours later... 
<TR>Finally</TR>, we arrived! It is just the start of today's great plans.
We headed straight toward the Merry- Go- Round... We got on the ride without waiting. <TR>After</TR> a little time for the Merry- Go- Round, we went to ride a roller coaster.

<TR>After</TR> going on some fun rides, we headed off toward the places where we could get some treats and sweets for lunch.
<TR>Since,</TR> it was a hot day, I bought some ice cream and some juice. My friends bought five bags of cheese popcorn and five bags of caramel popcorn. They bought a lot of cotton candy too. <TR>Lastly,</TR> we all bought 10 slices of bread and 20 hamburgers.
<TR>Then,</TR> we went to the theater! You know, some theme parks have one or two theaters. <TR>Anyway</TR>, we watched a romantic and lovely movie, called ""Titanic"". 
<TR>After that</TR>, we played near the theme park. <TR>Even thought</TR>, it was a little cool, we were happy.

(That’s one of my biggest wishes! Oh~) It was Anna. Oh! You know what? Anna feels better now. <TR>And</TR> she can help us at my restaurant every weekend! Doesn’t that sound great? I hope she doesn’t get sick again because she is my best, best, best friend! <TR>And</TR> we take care of each other! <TR>Anyway</TR>, we talked for a while. “Hi, Cindy. Um…Do you remember our first trip or adventure to the isolated island?”she said. ""Oh, yes! I think it was fun! <TR>But</TR> why are you asking me that question? To answer? Ha!” “Oh, no… I want to… um… I want to travel again because it was really fantastic and fun. I hope you agree with me.The reason I am asking you is because the secret door is our own secret and you are my best friend.” <TR>Since</TR> she is my best friend and asked, I agreed and she was granted her first wish. 
I found and opened the secret door with the secret golden key. I hope it will not take us back to the pirate. I don’t like scary things. <TR>Anyway,</TR> Anna came and we crawled through the secret door. It was too small to fit both of us. <TR>Anyway</TR>, on the secret door a message appeared. It said, 
""To the place where it is dark.But, be very careful. You might be in danger. Hold your friend's hand and you will be out of danger."" Oh… “To the dark place where it is dark. Anna! Can you guess?” I asked Anna. Anna shrugged.""Are you ready? If you are ready,say, 'I want to go there.' And the great adventure will come true."" Another saying appeared from the secret door. “We want to go there,” we said together. The wind started to blow. The secret door started to move and spin. It spun faster, faster, faster and faster. It was going as fast as possible. <TR>Then</TR> everything was still. <TR>Absolutely</TR> still and absolutely quiet. 
We opened our eyes.Where were we? We were in a dark cave? Yes, it was a cave… Oh my… it was too dark to see anything. I hopeit’s another scary adventure! <TR>But,</TR> Anna’s face was big~ She had a big smile! Oh no… She was too smiley. <TR>Anyway,</TR> back to the present. We didn't have much with us,except for our smartphones and clothes. <TR>So</TR> we just decided to go deeperinto the deep and dark cave. <TR>Suddenly,</TR> we heard a squeaking sound. What wasthat sound? It was another sound ofdanger. We saw the pirates and the pirate ship with our eyes last time. <TR>But</TR>, this time I heard something with my ears. How could thathappen? It our first time to hear the strange sound and it was making us scared. It seemed to get scarier. Welooked up because that strange soundwas coming from the top of the cave. Does that mean… Oh no… We might see thebats… And many bats… We looked up again. Atfirst, we didn’t see anything. <TR>But,</TR> this time it was different. There were many,many scary eyes… Oh… I wanted toget out of here… Anna was scared too…I think this time seemed more dangerousbecause it felt like they wouldattack us in a minute. We held ourhands together and said, ""Itwill be all right. You will be fine and okay.""<TR>Suddenly,</TR> the bats flew out of the cave. <TR>Even though</TR> it was the daytime, theyflew. Isn’t that amazing?
Wait, what’s thatnow? We walked toward the strange sight. It was a bat. It was alone and it is trying to fly with its other friends. What was happening to him? I named her Batty. She is a bat. AndI hope the bat likes the name. Battywas hurt. I think it was too hurt sowe decided to take her with us. WhenI went home with Anna I would fix herwings so that she could fly again. <TR>But</TR> I was curious about why Batty couldn't fly in the first place and how she got hurt. Didshe fight with her friends? Or did she break her little wings in anaccident? But, how and why? 
With these big questions I walked out of thecave. <TR>Suddenly</TR>, a letter flew inside the cave. We opened it and read it quickly. It said, ""Be kind and be nice. Tryto understand the bat. <TR>And then</TR>,your mission will be complete."" “Bekind and be nice…” said Anna. “I think we should help Batty and keep her fromdanger. Ah! It is not ourdanger. It is her danger. She might die if she can't fly. If she can'tfly, she can't eat and be with herfriends. Oh no!” Anna said oncemore. Anna is a genius! She understoodthe secret door’s mission and saying. 
We found a good spot to care for Batty. It wasso nice. Batty kept squeaking and squeaking. Anna was trying to understand herand take care of her. I hope it worked… We hopedfrom deep within our hearts to help Batty. Oh my… and then I heard it! “Iheard! Yipee! I heard! I heard her problem, Anna! Isn’t that amazing?” I saidwith my excited voice! Yes! I did it. I understood Batty’s problem and what she was saying. I know now! “She was hurt by a sharp cave stone while she was flying! <TR>So,</TR> she couldn’t use herwings and she couldn’t go with her friends. I think she is really missing her friends!” Anna clapped her hands. “Wow, and nowwe have to fix her wings so that shecan fly with her friends!” 
I searched my smartphone for help on how to fix animal wings. <TR>And</TR> there was somethingabout bat’s wings also! “We need a band,something similar to a rubber band!<TR>But</TR>, how could we find it?” Oh… Iwas disappointed until Anna found our first- aid kit! It was awesome! We quickly fixedher wings and let her go. 
Our final missionended! We were so glad that Batty could fly again and be with her friends! “Bye-bye, Batty. I hope we can see you again next time!” we said andleft. We found the secret door ofthe cave where we had fixed Batty. We opened the secret door and went inside.“We want to go home…” we said in our smallest voice. The wind started to blow.The secret door started to move and spin. It spun faster, faster, faster andfaster.

"567&Hi there! Did you have a good time? We meet each other again! I am happy to be with you. And now I have something to tell you. It is something really special!
<EV>Two days ago, I started my own restaurant.</EV> It is a very small restaurant… Whew! I got a lot of money (but, I wasn’t the world record holder). Did I open my own restaurant by myself? No! Well, it’s mine. <TR>But</TR>, my best friend Anna helped me. She decorated the restaurant, made the menu, bought the things that I needed for restaurant, and settled things such as chairs, tables, and dishes. I’m not sure. I just bought the place for the restaurant and Anna did almost everything. I just looked at her and I did rest a lot… <TR>But</TR>, I think I am not a lazy girl. I am the owner of this restaurant and I will be a busy person soon.
Oh… I didn’t tell you my restaurant’s name. I actually didn't know what to name my restaurant at first. <TR>But</TR> I knew I had to. That was my first restaurant job. I said to you that I will become a busy person soon. <TR>And</TR> that means now! 
What could be my restaurant's name? I needed the perfect restaurant name… I though of Cindy’s Restaurant, Sweet Restaurant, Beautiful Restaurant, Perfect Day Restaurant, Teddy Restaurant… Ah! I hoped it could be Perfect Day Restaurant. <TR>Because</TR> I hope everything goes fine and perfect! <TR>And</TR> I could change my restaurant’s name at any time! 
Yesterday, I called my friends, including Anna. I think she is like my family. I asked my friends if they could help me for a while. I said to them that I would reward them well! Of course, with money~ Ha! They all agreed with me! Everyone, except for Anna. She was sick and she is actually still sick even now. She couldn’t help me. I was sad. She was sad. We were all sad because Anna is our best friend! <TR>Anyway,</TR> with a great smile and great hope we started our restaurant. I hope that I would not be the owner of this restaurant! Everyone, I mean my friends all are restaurant owners and good helpers. Yipee! Now, my Perfect Day Restaurant begins!
<TR>Now</TR>, it’s time to sell our food and make some money. I am glad that we are all friends and can help each other! Janny and Mike cleaned up the floors and the whole restaurant, including the desks, tables, and kitchen. Ha! It seemed perfect even though it’s only the beginning! Amily and Susan set up the tables. They put down the spoons, forks, knife, cups, and the Menu! Emily and Jack wore the restaurant’s uniforms and their job was to greet the guests. <TR>So</TR>, our restaurant members are Amily, Emily, Susan, Janny, Mike, Jack, Anna, and me! There are eight members! Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, not now since Anna is sick. <TR>Anyway</TR>, I didn’t tell you about my job! I am the head of our friends and I am leader of our great members. I calculated the money, such as how much the customers or guests ate, and sat at the office desk! He… He…
Ting! Ting! Our first customer has arrived! Wow! Wow! Wow! It’s fantastic! We have to treat our customers well! It was a girl! She was very cute and came with her mother! 
“Please sit here, since you are our first customers we are going to treat you well and you can choose one thing for free.” Emily and Jack said at the same time. “Oh! You are such good greeters! How lovely! It’s just fits so well with your restaurant’s name, Perfect Day. I hope you will do well! I like this place! I will recommend this restaurant to my friends and other people that I know!” the cute girl’s mother said to us. I felt great and perfect! I felt like we were having the perfect day like the name of our restaurant! Ha! 
Thirty minutes later, there were more and more customers! <TR>Soon,</TR> our seats were full and most of the customers had to wait for a few minutes. I was really happy! <TR>And</TR> my friends were happy too. <TR>But</TR>, we were all busy at the same time! 
<TR>After</TR> all the customers enjoyed our food and paid the money to me and left, we all felt great and happy so we rested for a while. It was almost dark! <TR>But,</TR> our jobs weren't done! We had to clean and design more! We painted and bought some bright lights. <TR>After</TR> a few more hours it's almost midnight and our restaurant was really, really, really fantastic and wonderful.

"569&<EV>Hi, my name is Cindy and I had fun for a while.</EV> You know about my great dinosaur, right? <TR>And</TR> this is my next journey to a scary place and the beginning of a new story. 
One great morning, I woke up and it was 8 o’clock. I had my best friends. You probably think that you should only have one best friend. <TR>But</TR>, not this time. I have three best friends: Teddy, Huggy, and Uppy. Huggy is from the internet. <TR>Actually</TR>, it’s the character of Skype. <TR>Anyway</TR>, I have another one! Ha! I have many, many, many best friends. Anna is another one of my best friends. 
Today we were going to meet each other and we are planning on going for a hike. We are going to a smaller mountain! The mountain is not hard to hike up or down! Oh! I will not take Uppy and Teddy. I also couldn't take, Huggy because, I couldn't bring computers to the mountain in my small bag. <TR>Anyway</TR>, the time came and I got busy.
<TR>Then</TR> my phone rang. It was Anna. She said, “Hey Cindy. I don't think I can go hiking with you today. I think I am a little sick. I might have a cold. <TR>So</TR>, I hope that if you are okay with it, we can just stay at your home and talk.” <TR>Of course</TR>, I said, “Okay,” because I am perfect and I am always happy if I can stay with my friend, especially with my best friend. 
<TR>And suddenly</TR>, I saw something behind my closet. I was trying to find clothes to go hiking with my best friend and then, I saw it. It was a door! It was a small door that I could get inside. <TR>But</TR>, the door was locked and I have to find the key. 
Ding-dong! Ding-dong! My door bell rang. My best friend came! Wow! She came very quickly! <TR>Anyway</TR>, I told Anna about the secret door and now we were looking for the secret key. We looked everywhere but, we couldn't find it anywhere. We just found a lot of dust under the bed, in the closet, and on the floor. <TR>Then</TR>, I looked up while stretching. Oh, what’s that? It’s a golden key! Hey! <TR>Now,</TR> I found it! Yay! We unlocked the secret door and… … … … … … … … … … whoosh! A message appeared, “To the great place where you can find treasure…” I read. We looked at each other for a while and we went inside the door. “Wow… Where is this place? I want to go there! I want to travel there! How great!” I muttered. The wind started to blow. The secret door started to spin. It spun faster, faster, faster, and faster. It was going as fast as possible. <TR>Then</TR> everything was still. It was absolutely still and absolutely quiet. <TR>But</TR>, only for a while and a great wind started to blow again. <TR>Then</TR>, a bright light appeared. 
I woke up. “Where am I now?” I wondered. I was with Anna. Whew! I felt dizzy. Whew… It was such a great imagination and also a great dream. It was an adventure dream. I stood up. I opened my two eyes. I woke up my friend. I think… we were on an isolated island. It was an isolated island! It was the great place where I could find treasure. Wait! Island and treasure… Those two words are often linked with pirates! Ah!! Oh! No! “We have to get out of here!”
I could see that something was coming toward us and it was a pirate ship. The pirates grabbed us and now we were on the pirate ship. They were saying something but, I couldn't understand because, it was in their own language. I couldn't believe it! We were on a pirate ship? It was a real pirate ship. Oh my… 
We had to get out of there. <TR>And</TR> we had to go home. We explained what had happened and they just laughed and laughed for a long long time… Why were the pirates so foolish? I don’t know… <TR>Anyway</TR>, I dreamed of a pirate when I was my younger sister’s age because I wanted to get treasures like pirates do. <TR>But</TR>, not now. I think the pirates were too foolish to get something from the island. They have to be smart like my best friend, Anna, and me! HA! 
We muttered and stood up. We were good at exercising even though I actually don’t like to exercise. Ha… ha… Anyway, we did some Taekwondo. The pirates all ran away or else they have to become our slaves. <TR>So</TR>, we got home safely. We found the secret door on the isolated island. It was in the tallest palm tree. We opened it with our secret golden key and we said, “We want to go back to our own home. We want to go home!”
The wind started to blow again. The whole palm tree started to spin. It spun faster and faster. <TR>Then</TR> everything was still. It was absolutely still and quiet. 
Wow! We were back! Hmm… It was a great adventure! <TR>And</TR> I am glad and also surprised that is was not a dream! 
<TR>And</TR> we talked about our great adventure. <TR>And</TR> the time went by quickly!

"570&<EV>I will tell you my great story.</EV> I made this story up by using my great imagination! You will love it! 
It was amazing. I can't believe myself. I know you want to know so the amazing, amazing, amazing story is starting now. Listen carefully. 
One summer night, I was really tired because of my students from school. I took a shower. I brushed my teeth. I changed from my clothes into pajamas. I checked the time. I planned for the next day. <TR>And then</TR> I realized that the next day was the start of the weekend. <TR>So</TR>, I could sleep late until the afternoon. I was glad that I don't have my own child yet. It would be harder if I had my own child or children... <TR>Anyway</TR>, I slept and I dreamed the most exciting dream ever! It was not about Running Man, or visiting my favorite cousins and relatives. It was the best dream I have ever had. In the best dream, my students were listening well during the classes and I saw that I would be beautiful forever. Ha... Ha... 
Click-clock! Click-clock! My first noisy alarm rang. Oh... I turned that off quickly. What time was it? Oh, it was 6 am! It was too early to wake up, especially during the weekend. The sweet weekend. 
Clock-click! Clock-click! My second noisy alarm rang. Oh... I turned it off again. This time I did it slowly. I slowly turned off my second boring and noisy alarm. What time was it? Oh, it was 7:30 am! Oh my... It was almost time to wake up for the weekday! <TR>But</TR> it was not the right time to wake up during the weekend! Uh... I was too tired to open my eyes. <TR>But</TR>, I still knew where my boring and noisy alarm was because I turn it off every day. Always! 
Gangnam Style~ Oop! Oop! Gangnam Style~ Umm~ Sweet sound. Sweet music. The sweet alarm bell. My final sweet and cute alarm rang. Gangnam Style is still popular and PSY is still popular nowadays too! I woke up and looked at the time. It was 9 o'clock. Of course am. Oh, it's time to wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Sleepyhead! 
I quickly headed to the bathroom to wash my face, brushed my teeth, and took a shower. I had to wash my face after I wake up because if I don't wash my face after waking up, I can look like a zombie teacher. 
Wait! Wait! What was that? I walked straight toward my window. What did I see? Uh-oh! A dinosaur! What? It looked like a scary, scary, scary dinosaur? “Whew... Is there something in my eyes?"" I rubbed my eyes and looked again through my window. “It IS a dinosaur!” It's good that there was a dinosaur. Right? <TR>Anyway</TR>, I went straight to the bathroom, changed my clothes, ate my breakfast quickly and then, I saw it again. I was relieved that the dinosaur was a plant eater. It was a herbivore. How did I know? I am a kind and smart girl. 
<TR>Anyway</TR>, I thought for a while that I should tell the police. <TR>But</TR>, I knew that they (the police) would kill or catch the dinosaur and that the dinosaur would be unhappy. I thought I should make the dinosaur smaller and keep it as a pet. It would be a new pet. I really wanted a pet, especially a dog, but now I didn't want one anymore. I just wanted the dinosaur. 
I walked to the dinosaur. I walked very slowly. The dinosaur didn't see me. That was good. I gave him some plants. <TR>And</TR> he loved it! Oh! I really like him! My lovely pet! He didn't seem scary anymore and it's good that nobody had seen my cute dinosaur yet. Whew! What a relief! I wanted to take him inside of my house but, he was too big and my house was too small. <TR>So</TR>, I hid him under the big, big, big, big, big, big house that was bigger than my own house. “He does seem comfortable. And he loves me a lot. I think he understands me well. Well~”
<TR>Now</TR>, he is my pet and friend! I am not lonely anymore. I am happy with him. I hope he will be my friend forever! Forever~ Forever... Forever! Ah- ha! I really love him. 
That was my greatest, greatest... 
Click-clock! Click-clock! “Oh my! Where am I?” Oh! I was in my class and the students are shouting at each other. What a mess... Whew! It was all just a sweet dream. Oh... I really want a pretty, friendly dinosaur for a pet... Well... It was a dream and I enjoyed my dream! <TR>Now</TR>, it's time to get up and study with my students again! ""Hey, hey, hey! You! Open your books to page..."" What's that? What's that? 
Uh- oh! I think it was a dinosaur. <TR>And</TR> it's a carnivore! Help me! Help me! Please!",::,4,::,4,::,4,::,2,::,"The story dragged at a few points just because the same ideas were repeated over and over again, making those parts sound very redundant.

"571&<EV>I received many presents or gifts from different people.</EV> My teacher, parents, friends, cousins, and other relatives gave me lots of presents, and I always receive great presents. I think is because I am a child and children usually really love gifts. I think gifts often represent the gratitude/thank-you of other people. <TR>But</TR>, not all gifts or presents mean “thank you”. They could also be birthday gifts. Many things can happen. 
<TR>Anyway</TR>, I already said to you, “I received many presents or gifts from many people.” I received so many presents and gifts from other people when I went to kindergarten. <TR>So,</TR> I can’t remember all those presents… <TR>And</TR> I can’t pick just one gift or present that is my favorite and the best. <TR>But</TR> I can try to tell you… Okay, I will just tell you!

I was very excited that day. <TR>Because</TR> on Christmas, we got our presents from Santa. <TR>Well, now </TR>I know that Santa was actually our parents! (<TR>But</TR>, don’t tell my younger sister!

<EV>Today was the greatest day of this week.</EV> I really, really, really, really, really enjoyed today. Can you guess why? <TR>Well</TR>... It's time for my answer! Today I went to a Halloween Party. I had fun at a Halloween Party at my best friend's English Academy. 
Yesterday, my best friend invited me to her Halloween Party. I was so happy to be invited. <TR>And</TR> with enormous hope I asked my mom if I could go. My mom's answer was simple! She said, ""Yes! Of course! Enjoy your first great Halloween Party!"" I was so relieved and happy. My mom's answer was so cool! Wow... I love her so much! <TR>Anyway</TR>, I was invited to the party and the great day finally came. In the morning, I was so excited to go to school. <TR>And</TR> during class I couldn't concentrate. My heart was pounding and pounding. My classmates' situations were the same as me. They were enjoying the day. 
My boring class was finished and I ran to my best friend. We ran, not walked, together to go to her Academy. Ta-da! We arrived! 
<TR>First</TR>, we threw down our schoolbags. <TR>Second</TR>, we ran to play games. We played three games. The English Academy was really small. It was smaller than my house. <TR>Actually</TR>, it was just a little bigger than my house. <TR>Anyway</TR>, we enjoyed all of them. We played a horror game, a speed game, and a senses game. I will explain simply about the three fun games. <TR>First</TR>, I will talk about the horror game! We had to find the eyeballs made of plastic in the really dark room. I was really scared. If you found the eyeballs, you could get a big present! You will probably love that. <TR>Second</TR>, I played the speed game! Um... You have to be with your partner. One person explain and describe words that she or he saw on the computer. <TR>And then</TR>, the partner has to try to guess the word. There were about two to three teams. Whoever had the most of words won and also got some candy! Mmm... Yummy! I think that was my favorite game. My final explanation will be about the sense game. If there are 5 members on the team, it would get 5 numbers. <TR>For example</TR>, if there are 3 people, then there will only be 3 numbers. The person who shouts the last number loses and the others win! <TR>And</TR> again, we got candy at the end of the game. It was so yummy! I especailly really like the coke-flavored candy. 
<TR>So</TR>... I had a really fun time. <TR>But</TR>, I wanted to have more candy. I was hoping to get more, but I just got 3 or 4 pieces of candy. I was a little disappointed... <TR>Well</TR>, I had a great and fun time there! <TR>Next</TR> Halloween I want to go there with my best friend and I want to get more candies again, especially the coke-flavored candy! Ha-ha!
<CO>I will finish my long Halloween diary by wishing you a happy Halloween! </CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,Some grammar issues and the ideas could have been organized a little better but otherwise it was fine.,//
"573&<EV>I thought about what would happen if I were on a deserted island.</EV> How would I survive? <TR>First</TR>, I thought of the three items that I would want to take with me to use while I am on a deserted island… If a selfish and greedy person were to go there, they might take their money. <TR>But</TR> you can’t use that forever. I wouldn't be able to spend, buy, or use the money. Money is a useless thing on a deserted island. Can you take a shower with money? Should you make a fire with money? No! Money is just for selling and buying things. I am a smart girl~ Ta- da! Ka! Ha!
<TR>Now</TR> let’s go back to our new and incredible diary topic. I would take some fruits and vegetables… I mean I would bring some food there! <TR>Because</TR> humans have to eat and drink while they are living on the Earth. I wouldn't just bring food. I would also need some pots and dishes… I mean things to help me cook the food! The most simple food to make is… ramen! I would take ramen there! <TR>And</TR> eat all day long. I would be bored and wouldn't feel so good after eating so much ramen. My mother will be surprised at me, because I really like ramen but, I turned into a special girl who doesn't want to eat ramen! <TR>But</TR>, it's hard to believe that I will hate ramen!
Now! With food and cooking things for the deserted island… I have one more thing I could take there. What should the last item be? It would be for playing, studying, dancing, singing, or communication. Oh! I know! I will take a computer… A very small one. We call these small computers “notebooks”… I don’t know why. <TR>But</TR>, they just call them that. The word ""notebook"" has very different meanings in Korea and America. <TR>Anyway</TR>, I would take a notebook, a small computer, for communication! I could communicate with my family, friends, and some other people I know. A computer would be good for me because I can meet people through the internet, and I can enjoy with that! <TR>Also</TR>, it could fit inside of my bag. It could be a school bag for me because I am an elementary school student! (<TR>And</TR> I want to write my daily diary on the internet or computer…)

"574&<EV>I have many fears.</EV> <TR>But</TR>, I have one that is worse than the others. Do you know what it is? <TR>Maybe</TR> when I tell you what my greatest fear is, you will laugh, especially the boys. <TR>Well</TR>, I have to tell you now! One day I was going to the country with my family. We were going to Icheon where the pottery is very famous. We rode the bus because Icheon is very far from Seoul. When the bus arrived in Icheon we got off the bus and just stayed there. We had to find the way to the pottery factory. <TR>While</TR> we were standing there, my younger sister suddenly shouted, ""Hey! What is that?""

That's just an insect. You can kill it by yourself!"" <TR>Luckily</TR>, when I shook my leg, it hopped away! Do you like insects or bugs? I don't like them. I really don't like them! Oh! I have another story about one of my fears! It happened in Busan. <TR>While</TR> I was playing with my cousins, I ran between the trees. In between the trees, there was a web! Can you guess what happened next? <TR>Well</TR>, the web became attached to my face and clothes. <TR>Luckily</TR>, It was not a bug! I am a human! <TR>Also</TR>, there were flies on the web but no spiders! <TR>For</TR> me it was a bad day and also for the spider, but it was a lucky day for those insects! <CO>What is your greatest fear?</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,"Overall it was fine but the structure could have been better.

Oct 11th, 2012. Today is Thursday and I went to school like I usually do. I had a good time until we started our sixth class, which is also our final class. My homeroom teacher was very sad and tired that day. I didn't know why. <TR>But</TR>, I think the teacher was sad and mad because of our behaviors. Our class was a little noisy. 
<TR>And</TR> she even cried! Her nose and eyes got red because she was crying. I was worried about her! <TR>And</TR> today I learned an important lesson! Do not make a lot of noise! Do not be like wild animals and listen to your teacher all time even when you are sad, mad, sad and tired. If you say to your teacher that you are sad, but she is the best medicine in the world. Do you think the same way?
<TR>Because of</TR> that situation, I received and learned an important lesson and I had to think about the bad and good things. <TR>Also</TR> I spent time thinking about my friends, my teachers, my parents... I will try not to do the bad things and try to do some good things instead. <CO><TR>And</TR> do not do the same things that everyone else does. </CO>

"576&<EV>I watched many movies, and I like most of them.</EV> <TR>But</TR>, the best movie I saw was ""Hairspray"". I watched this movie last month with my friends. This movie started with songs and dancing. The main character was a very fat girl. She liked dancing and singing, but she didn't like studying. <TR>One day</TR>, she slept during class. <TR>So</TR>, the teacher wrote a message and sent her to the other class. The other class was very noisy, because they weren't studying. <TR>Instead</TR> they were dancing and singing to happy songs. That place was where the bad students who didn't concentrate in the class went. The girl decided to join the dancing club. She had a dream; the dream was dancing and singing in the hairspray advertisement. <TR>Finally</TR>, she was able to be a part of that advertisement with the boy who was also in the hair spray advertisement. This was the summary of the movie. <TR>Before</TR> I watched this movie, I had another favorite movie. That movie was the story about the love between a human, vampire and werewolf. <TR>But</TR>, now ""Hairspray"" is my favorite, and it is the best movie I've ever seen. I think I like the songs and dancing in this movie the most. I don't like movies that seem like a concert with dancing and singing. <TR>But</TR>, strangely I liked this movie. I don't know why, but I want to recommend ""Hairspray"" to other people who didn't watch this movie yet. Maybe they will like this movie too. <TR>Also</TR> I will write good things about ""Hairspray"" in my blog. If you want to know in more detail about the movie, ""Hairspray"", you can visit my blog. <TR>But</TR>, I don't know when I will write the review about this movie.

I don't know how or why this has happened. <TR>But</TR>, I guess I always talk about the game and want to play with my friends in real life, not just in my dreams. Running Man is my favorite TV program. Running Man starts at 6:20-6:30 ever Sunday.

<TR>But, before</TR> we decided to do that dance, we were going to dance to ""Gangnam Style"". That is a very famous song right now. <TR>However</TR>, the fourth graders will dance that instead and we are going to dance the Alphabet Dance for our school's big Field Day!

<TR>First</TR> I like samgyetang, the chicken soup, because it is very tasty and I like chicken. It is also salty.

<TR>Second</TR>! Kimchi! I like kimchi, because it is spicy and also salty like samgyetang. I think it can also taste a little sweet. You might not believe me, but it is true.

It is the bookmobile.
A bookmobile is a bus that carries books on shelves.

If a bookmobile visits our village, our village people go to the bookmobile and borrow books.

I like the bookmobile because it gives me a different feeling from school libraries or municipal libraries.

I can borrow three or four books with one library card.

There are some differences between the bookmobile and the municipal library.

<EV>Today was the last day of classes.</EV>

My 5th grade classes were over and spring vacation would start.

<TR>So</TR> I emptied my school bag and I went to the school light-heartedly.

When I arrived at the classroom, my classmates were gathered and doing something.

Five minutes later, we were waiting for our teacher.

As soon as my teacher entered the classroom, we began to set off our firecrackers.

Our teacher was astonished at the sight and our surprise event was a great success.

We prepared the event for our teacher very secretly.

We hung the balloons on the ceiling, stuck the papers, which had messages written on them such as ""Thank you, teacher!"" on the board, and prepared a cake.

I thought the surprise event was very fun and awesome and it is also very useful for the birthday party later.

Our teacher seemed very happy and excited, and then our last day of classes was over.

There are various characters including the Uther king,

Merlin saves and helps Arthur to becomes a king in this drama.

If the Uther king changed his mind and magic was allowed to be used,

Arthur is very brave and good at swordsmanship.)

Photoshop is a photo editing software.

We can retouch or transform our photos or pictures using Photoshop.

Photoshop has many functions to make changes to photos.

I will explain some of them and their shortcut keys.

Move tool (Shortcut key: V): The move tool allows you to move 
a selection or entire layer of the photo by dragging it with your mouse or using your
keyboard arrows keys.

We can click the some object to select and move it by 
dragging it with our mouse to where we want to move.

Magnetic lasso tool (Shortcut key: L): You can click to set the anchor
point for our magnetic lasso tool then move it along the edge
of your image to grab.

Clone stamp tool (Shortcut key: S): It lets you copy from one area 
of an image to another using any type of brush.

There are a lot of tools besides the ones I mentioned above.

I modified my photo by lowering the transparency of a spot 
on my face to hand in an application form for a Photoshop test at school.

It was great to modify the dot of my face. 

I would like to know who made Photoshop, how and why.

While we were doing that, my sister and my cousins's sister were by the tent playing volleyball. When my cousin and I got back to the tent we all ate a delicious breakfast. <SR>It was only rice but it was still very delicious.</SR>
After breakfast we took a long break and I changed from my clothes into a swimming suit in the tent. 
Do you want to know how I did that? 
I went into my cousin's tent where there is a door. I hide behind the door and changed. 
And we took a break again, and then my cousin's sister, my sister, my cousin, and my uncle went to the beach with a little boat and two beach balls.
And we rode the boat and we played with the beach ball too.
When we went into the water, it was time for the low tide so we kept going into deeper and deeper water.
We were so deep that we felt like we were almost at the bottom of the sea.
Anyway, my uncle told us not to go any deeper. He says it in a way that we will always listen to him. 
<SR>At the beach I felt something painful in my body.</SR> <TR>But</TR> I didn't think it was a jellyfish.
So I didn't tell anyone and I kept playing. But three or four hours later, my cousin told my father that I was breathing very hard. So my dad and I went to the hospital near the 
ocean and the doctor said it was very bad and we came very late.
He said that the jellyfish poison was in my body and that I could die. We had to wait and see for one more week. After that we came back to the tent.
When my mother, father, uncle, sister, cousin, cousin's sister, and aunt all heard this, they took care of me very well.
And we ate dinner with delicious meat and I took a short walk with my sister, cousin, and cousin's sister named Hunji. 
And Hunji took a picture of us at the beach and we took her picture too.
<TR>But</TR> again I couldn't breath well so my cousin said that we had to go back to our tent.
So we came to our tent again and I sat down and talked with my cousin.
And we played a little game with the phone until the delicious sausages were being cooked.
And luckily, my uncle called us very quickly to eat the sausages, which were delicious. 
And when we are eating the sausages, my sister, mother, and aunt went to a famliy mart and bought two bottles of rum, three ice-creams, and four bottles of soda. After we ate everything, I was too tired that I went to the tent and slept.
<SR>When I woke up it was morning and I was very surprised.</SR> I took a morning walk
with my father and I watched the bugs. After I came back to the tent with my father, I saw that my cousin, uncle, Hunji, and aunt were already up and making breakfast. It was also very delicious. After eating breakfast, I did yo-yo with my cousin
and we played other games. Then we packed our things and came home. 
But anyway, a few minutes later my cousin and I met again at my second aunt's house.

We first put up our tent, then my sister and I went to the river to play. 


There were many rocks in the river so when I went in there without shoes, I almost died from the pain.
<TR>So</TR> I put my shoes on and went back into the river and it was fine.
<TR>So</TR> my sister and I played there for a while.

<TR>Anyway</TR> my sister and I went to the little zoo next. I saw rabbits, monkeys, a donkey, a pig, a goat, and a lamb.
I saw that almost all the people there for the animals.
We had to buy them of course and cost 100 won. <TR>But</TR> I found money that someone had dropped so I used that to buy animal feed. My sister stole some animal feed and monkey food, which we fed to the animals.

One of the monkeys suddenly tried to bite me at his cage.

she was a ghost. <TR>So</TR> I told my family. My father was not scared but my mother was
thinking the same thing as me.

It was a nice spring day in Geronimo Stilton's city. Geronimo loved the weather so he decided to have a party. 
Everyone ate pizza at the party. After the party he was too tired to wash the dishes so he put all the plates on his desk.
<TR>But</TR> he couldn't fall asleep because he ate too much.
<TR>So</TR> he rolled around in his bed. He fell off his bed and hit the desk with all the dishes. Many of the dishes fell onto the floor and crashed into tiny pieces. 
Geronimo stepped on the sharp pieces and got hurt so he went to the bathroom to get a bandage.
<TR>But</TR> he slipped and crashed onto the bathroom floor.
<TR>But</TR> suddenly it got black and a voice said, ""Geronimo, you brave knight, please help us and save the princess.""
Geronimo knew the voice belonged to the frog and rainbow dragon.
He met them during his first fantasy adventure when he rescued the princess.
<TR>But</TR> the fantasy rainbow dragon said that princess was kidnapped again.
He said that during a meeting in the elves' country everyone decided that Geronimo would need to rescue the princess.
<TR>So</TR> Geronimo went there with the giant, cat boots, talking ship, white deer, silver dragon, and the princess of the elves. They all went to Geronimo to rescue the princess. 
They would have to pass though the nightmare country. <TR>First</TR>, the giant scratched his feet and said, ""I can't go with you anymore. I will slow everyone else down."" 
<TR>So</TR> the giant stayed behind and everyone else went to go rescue the princess. They had to cross the
river and that cat said he couldn't pass the river so he stayed there. The princess of the elves stayed to fight against a monster. The white deer was hurt at the spiky tree so he had to stay there. Only Geronimo was left to go to the 
nightmare country. There was a very big mountain. He climbed it and saw an army made with rock. He hid but a few minutes later, the grand high witch who was the leader of the nightmare country, found Geronimo. Geronimo fought with her and the witch ran away with her dragon but Geronimo chased her with the rainbow dragon.
He dropped her to the ground from the high sky.
After Geronimo defeated the witch, he rescued the princess. 
He went back to the elves' country. His other friends also made it back safely.

I wanted to call my mother so I went inside the house
to call my mother.
<TR>But</TR> when I turned around to call my mother there was a ghost behind me.
The ghost was a woman and she had white skin and she was drooling blood. 
I was so scared that I kicked her and ran out the front door. I went to my friend's 
house. <TR>And</TR> when my friend and I came outside to look at my apartment window, there was a ghost looking at us. She was saying ""I will kill you.""
She was holding a knife in her hand ready to kill us.
We were so scared that I called my mother and told her not to go inside our house. My parents, my sister, my friend, my friend's mom, and I all went inside our house together. <TR>But</TR> there was no ghost, only blood. 
The next day we turned on the radio to relax and heard a laughing sound on the radio
and we all got scared.
<TR>Suddenly</TR> we heard a voice saying, ""I will kill you... I will kill you...""
<TR>But</TR> we didn't get killed. It was March when all of this happened. My grandmother had gone to Buddha to talk about our family.

"630&Hello. I am Jiyong.<EV>Yesterday in Little Fox I learned about
the Louvre, one of the biggest art museums in the whole world.</EV>
The Louvre is in France. There are 8.5 million people from all over the world who visit the Louvre each year. 
Now that's what I call a lot of visitors.
The Louvre is located in the heart of Paris, on the right bank of the Seine River. 
It's home to around 35,000 pieces of art and nearly 13 kilometers of 
galleries.That means it wouid take almost a year for a visitor to see everything
inside the museum!
When the louvre was first built,way back in 1190,it was designed to be a
fortress to protect paris from its enemies.At the time paris was largest city in
Europe,and over the next two hundred years,the city continued to grow.
Eventually the louvre wasn't big enough to protect the entire city.so,in 1364,
king charles v decided to turn it into a palace.
During the centuries that followed,members of the french royalty continued
changing the louvre,demolishing some sections and adding new buildings and 
wings,along with gardens and fancy decorations.French monarchs also collected
artwork, filling the louvre with colorful tapestries,elaborate carvings,and all
kinds of incredible paintings.Eventually the royal court decided to move to a new
place,abandoning the louvre for a while.finally,in 1793,goverment officials 
decided to turn the buildings into a museum for the public.
Today the louvre has three main wings.They're arranged like a giant
horseshou,and in the courtyard in the middle of the wings is a big glass pyrmid.
Inside the louvre,visitors can wee art from many different time periods.Ther's a
helmet worn by a real roman gladiator;Egyptian statues over 4000years old;
and a sword used at the coronations of french kings.Most people
visting the louvre stop to seethe most famous painting tn the world-the mona lisa.
I will talk about mona-lisa next time.

"632&<EV>Today I am so exited about going to Europe.</EV>
Well... today is Wednesday and we leave for Europe next Saturday. 
My mother said time is going by so fast and that she hasn't had any time to prepare for our trip to Europe.
<TR>But</TR> I think time is going by very slowly, and I am tired of waiting.
I am exicted about going to Europe, and we're riding the A380 airplane! 
The flight is supposed to take 11 hours, which means that we'll be on the airplane for almost one whole day.
There are big screens at every seat and I can watch all the movies I want.
We're staying in Europe for nine days and going to five countries: Switzerland, Austria, France, Germany, and Italy.
Yay! I am going to Europe! 
You see a month ago I broke my ankle, but it's almost healed now.
My mother always stays at home to work or play, but my sister and I always go to school and spend most of our time
outside so we feel like time is passing by very slowly. 
A few days ago, I thought that I would never get to go Europe while I am a
child.
<TR>But</TR> now we're going to Europe, and I am so happy.
Now my life is happy.
It's amazing to go to Europe during your childhood.
<TR>Yesterday</TR> I told my teacher and friends that I'm going to Europe. 
My friend said, ""Wow you're amazing! I am very proud of you.
I want to go to Europe too. Can you take me there with you?""
My father is very worried about me right now because if I get hurt at school we won't be able to go to Europe.
My father didn't go to his company.
Instead he is working from home, so he is always watching me very carefully these days.
I am bored when it's time for gym because I can't play any sports since my ankle still hasn't healed completely.

<TR>So</TR> I found the ""Treasure Island"" story on Little Fox. </EV>
It was more fun when I saw the animation and listened to the story that way.
I will give a summary of what happens.
Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jim.
He lived with his family at a small eating place.
<TR>But</TR> one day a big pirate with a white scar on his face came to Jim's house.
His name was Billy Bone, and he wanted to live at Jim's house.
<TR>So</TR> he moved in with Jim and his family.
<TR>But</TR> he always drank rum,and never paid his rent.
<TR>So</TR> Jim's father got sick and died.
I would be sick too if someone like <Billy Bone didn't pay while living at my house.
<TR>And</TR> I would also want to kill him. <TR>Even though</TR> Dr. Livesy came to Jim's house and
tried to help Jim's father, he still died.
That was Jim's first piece of bad luck.
One day while Billy Bone was out at sea, his friend, Black Dog, came to Jim's house.
<TR>And</TR> when Billy Bone came back to Jim's house, he fought with Black Dog.
Billy Bone put his knife into Black Dog's shoulder.
<TR>So</TR> Black God screamed and ran away. 
Billy Bone drank more rum, but fell over and died. 
Jim and his mother had to leave their house quickly because another pirate was coming to Jim's house. 
<TR>So</TR> Jim and his mother quickly got money out of Billy Bone's chest and ran away.

<TR>But</TR> it was fun too. I could ski better than my sister.
<TR>So</TR> I did the S-curve and my sister did A-brake.

We were all loud during our break talking about what we did over our summer vacations. During class, the teacher picked some students to share about what they did during their summer vacation. I was picked. I said that I went to the Jangan Sea and swam in the water during the day, and went to catch some clams at night. Ju-Young said that he went somewhere and played games with his cousins. Hannah told us that she went to Dae Myong condominium and played table tennis with her dad and her brother. After we listened to some of our other friends' stories, our teacher said to remember them well. <TR>At first</TR>, I didn't understand. <TR>However</TR>, when we finished eating lunch in the cafeteria and we came back from lunch break, we played two games. They were the consonant quiz game and BINGO game. We played the BINGO game first. Then, I realized why our teacher said to rememer what the other students did during their summer break because on the paper, there were boxes and inside the boxes, there were instructions like, ""Take out a piece of hair and give it to a student who had a haircut and get a sign."" If you had BINGO three times, you had to line up at the front of the class. I did not get three BINGO's so I didn't get a prize. <TR>But</TR> it was okay. There was another game left for me. It was the consonant quiz. There were group questions. We answered the questions that had the hint using only certain consonants. Some were hard but others were very easy. We got a little ball if our group answered the questions correctly. The winning group had five little balls but we only had two balls. <TR>So</TR>, we were almost in last place. <TR>However</TR>, there was a benefit to being almost last.

Also, there were some that had almonds inside the chocolte, and some that did not. The winning teams got other presents like stickers. The losing teams did not have anything so the teacher said that the team that had the most balls among the losing teams got to pick the chocolate they wanted first. We were the second group to get the chocolte. Min-Yeong used to live in Russia so she had already eaten a lot of Russia chocolate. She refused to eat the chocolate. I was happy to eat the chocolate. I chose the chocolate that had no almonds inside because I really, really hate almonds.

"645&Louis Braille was born in a small town in France in 1809. As a child, he liked to help his father make saddles and harnesses. When he was only three, he grabbed his father's awl. He tried to punch a hole in some leather but the awl slipped and made a hole in his left eye instead. If this happened today, doctors probably could have saved Louis's eye. But in 1812, nobody knew how to cure it. Within two years, Louis was blind in both eyes. Also, if this happened today, Louis could have attended special schools and could have learned as much as any other child attending school. But back then, blind people could not be taught to read or write. Louis's family took good care of him. They helped him to walk around his house and outside. He also learned to tell people apart by their voices and sounds they made. His oldest sister, Catherine, helped him learn to read. She made letters out of straw so Louis could feel their shapes. He did so well that he was accepted at the local school when he was only 7 years old. He memorized what the teacher said and he was the smartest kid in his class. Yet he was sad because he could not read the school books. So, his parents decided to send him to the National Institute for the Young Blind in Paris. At first, Louis had no friends. The kids in school played tricks on him. After a while, they became friends. Louis read raised letters. But, the letters were too big and it was hard to recognize the words. When he was 12, a man named Barbier came to their school and taught night writing. From that, Louis got an idea and made a new system for letters when he was only 15. The students loved it. They called it Braille. Strangely, the other teachers didn't like it. However, Louis didn't give up. Finally in 1844, the principal allowed students to use Braille in school.

The most important artifact from the Neolithic Age was the Comb-Pattern Pottery.

Beckje was different than other countries because they put Gold Diam Ornaments inside the grave of their king.
Silla's important artifact was the Horse Rider-shaped Vessel.

It was called ""Catch the Duck"". 
I will explain how the game is played. 
<TR>First</TR> we choose the tagger.
When the teacher says, ""Duck 3, goose 1,"" the tagger chooses three ducks and touches their heads.
<TR>Next</TR>, the tagger chooses one goose. The goose is like a catcher.
The goose can run to any part of the circle where the students are sitting to try and catch the ducks who are standing up. 
Meanwhile, the tagger and the ducks have to run away and sit down where the other ducks sat.
<TR>But</TR> they cannot sit again in the same place where they sat before.

We all went to our seats.
Everybody got a mini book.
I was fed up with books.
I already had many books at school.
<TR>However</TR>, the P.E. teacher made all the students in our class look inside while the teacher explained more about the book. 
There were many things to do like writing down what we did.
We have to exercise everyday, write down what we did, and get one of our parents to sign it.
It seems like it will be a long process.
If we lose our books, we'll get into a big trouble.
We have to pay 10000 won and buy the book again.
Our parents wouldn't be happy in that situation so the teacher told us not to lose them.
<TR>So</TR> today, I have to exercise. I don't know exactly what I will do yet.

Yu-Jin and I were the anchors and Sung-Eun was the reporter. At first, I did not smile at all so the teacher said that it looked like we were in a fight. 
<TR>But</TR> as we recorded over and over again, my skills improved a bit and I tried harder to smile.
<TR>In contrast to me</TR>, Yu-Jin had the opposite problem of laughing too hard. It was the complete opposite between me and her.
When we read the words incorrectly, we kept trying harder and harder. 
<TR>So</TR>, there were many recordings.
Being an anchor was hard, but I did not feel nervous.
<TR>Since</TR> the mike can record sounds that are small like a door that is slowly opening, we had to do everything over one more time when we heard some other sounds in the background.
When the anchor parts were done, Sung-Eun, who was a reporter came out and said her part all on her own.
It did not even take a minute because there is only one reporter.
Her voice were little small but it was beautiful.
When we finished, we cleaned up and turned off all the lights and pulled up the screen.

When the food came out, Hannah's mom called my mom to tell her that Hannah had arrived. I ran out quickly and greeted her. She was holding an icebox. When I saw it, I quickly realized that she brought an ice cream cake with her. I was thrilled that she brought it because I have never eaten an ice cream cake before. Hannah and I talked a little bit about what we would do when we got to my home. I think she was just as thrilled as I was because even though we go to each other's houses often, today was different.

We all ate the food quickly. When my sister went to a class, Hanna and I played board games while waiting. We got permission to bring one of the board games home. It was very fun. <TR>But</TR><TR it was strange because an hour already passed and we only played 3 games. My sister came out. Now it was time to go to my house. I got permission to bring one board game to our house.
When we arrived home, we played the board game that we brought home. It is a memory game that I used to play a lot when I was younger so I was used to that game. I won every time we played that game.
<TR>Next</TR>, we played jacks. At school, Hannah is very good at jacks and always comes in first place when we play jacks in our class. <TR>However</TR>, I beat her that night. It was amazing. She said she couldn't play well with the jacks that I had at home. I understood what she meant because the jacks we played with were too light.
Now we were hungry and ate dinner. Hannah and I ate unbalanced meals. <TR>But</TR> Hannah ate only a little and I ate a lot.
After eating dinner, we ate the ice cream cake. Hannah, my sister, and I ate only the chocolate part because the other ice cream flavors like mint and strawberry were not yummy.

My mom, my sister, and I woke up at about 8:30 a.m. I was very thrilled and excited to go to the swimming pool. We ate our simple kimpbap for our breakfast and hurried out to go to the swimming pool. We arrived in a few seconds. My sister and I saw the swimming pool and gasped. It was magnificent, I think. As soon as my sister and I got dressed in our swimsuits, we first went to the hot boiling spa. Ah, it was so great to rest in a warm place surrounded by cold air.<TR>However</TR>, we did not stey there for very long. My sister pleaded to go to the children's pool that was like a playground wet with water so I finally got up and slid down the short, not fun slide. <TR>But</TR>, it was fun when you get to the top because when the water drops, we go down the slide and there's a great splash of water all over me. After that, we went to the lazy river. <TR>And</TR> that's when I became shocked by an amazing discovery! I dove underwater and I saw an insect lying on the floor. I felt disgusted. <TR>So</TR>, my sister and I just sat down on a tube because we were afraid we might step on that disgusting insect with our own bare feet. At 10 a.m., the slides opened and we could ride on them. I persuaded my sister to ride the slides with me and finally, she said yes. <TR>First</TR>, we rode blackhole slide while siting on the double tube. It was thrilling. My sister said that she would have regretted it if she decided not to ride the slides. <TR>Next</TR>, we rode the wave slide. The wave slide is a U-shaped slide. It was similar to the blackhole slide, because my sister and I rode on a double tube again. I wanted the slide to be more fun so I forced my body forward. It was great. <TR>However</TR>, when I tried to persuade my sister to ride the whitehole slide, she said no. <TR>So</TR> I rode it by myself. I think she said no because we cannot wear life jackets or ride on a tube in the whitehole slide. I was afraid to ride it alone, but I still went on it. During the first time I rode it, I bumped my head against the wall of the slide and it was quite painful. <TR>But</TR> when I rode it the second time, I tried to be more careful and I didn't bump my head.

At first, I thought it was a holiday that chocolate companies made like ""Pepero Day"" on November 11th, but it actually comes from ancient history. 
2000 years ago in Greece, Feburary 14th was the day of love. It was the day of Juno, the goddess of woman and marriage. Many young unmarried men and women gathered together, and put their names into a jar. Then, they stayed together until February 14th of the next year. Usually, they would get married and have a happy marriage. <TR>But</TR>, the happiness ended when Emperor Claudius declared a lot of wars. He needed lots of unmarried men to make strong soldiers for a large army. People who disobeyed this law were killed. There was a priest named Valentine, and he helped many couples get married secretly. However, he got caught by Claudius and was sent to jail. When he was in jail, he fell in love with the jailer's daughter. The day before he was killed, he wrote a love letter to her and signed it, ""From your love Valentine."" That was how Valentine's Day was started. What a touching story. My friends succeeded on making chocolates and giving it to the boys whom they love. <TR>But</TR> I think only giving love and gifts to each other is useless. <CO>Like we do for other holidays, we must think about the meaning of Valentine's day and then celebrate love</CO>.

"667&<EV>On Saturday, I went to COEX with my mom</EV>. There was a Vision 2020 youth leadership forum at the auditorium. We were there for half of the day. Well, I don't have a specific dream.

There were many professors who you can only hear from once in a lifetime: Chang-Gyu Hwang the national chief technology officer; Robert Root-Bernstein, professor at Michigan State University; Jang-Sup Shin, professor at the National University of Singapore; Jeannie Suk, the first Asian woman tenured professor at Harvard University; and Dennis W. Hong, a professor at Virginia Tech. My favorite speech was from professor Jeannie Suk who told us stories. She talked about her life from when she was young to now, and how she wanted to be a ballerina. <TR>But</TR> her parents stopped her, and there were a huge fight between her parents and her. Her family dealt with the conclusion, which were based on their opinions, and she is now a professor at Harvard University today. At first, I felt kind of bored because I didn't pay any attention to the forum. <TR>But</TR> after lunch, it became really interesting. At the end, other Chungdahm branch students and I did an interview. <TR>Also</TR>, I had another interview from a different newspaper reporter, too. Mom said, ""You are so famous, honey.""

<TR>And</TR> we will have been going to school at 10:00am because of the cold waves. I agree that it was too cold yesterday. <TR>And</TR> my mom said that a cycle of three cold days and four warm days will come. It became really rare in the last 50 years because of pollution and changes in the weather from global warming. My lips are getting cracked and bloody. We have to be careful when we are going back home because the roads are slippery. I hate cold weather. <TR>But</TR> the most terrible thing is that sometimes we can't do P.E class because of the weather! 
<TR>However</TR>, there are also some advantages, too. We can go outside and have a snow fight with our friends during lunch time. There is plenty of time to play outside. Yesterday, our classroom and boys from another classroom had a snow fight; girls versus boys.

When I woke up, it was really different.

Today, I decided that we can just stay home and do something else. It can be fun to do something new."" 
<TR>So</TR>, we studied for a few hours. We were still frustrated that we weren't going to our grandparents' house. Then, mom allowed us to watch some movies. We watched the ""Simpsons"" and ""Harry Potter."" I felt like something was wrong because mom never allows us to watch movies. It was really fun, so we watched the movies for about 3 hours. I wish I could watch them again now, but mom put those things away immediately so that we can't see where she keeps them. We ate pizza for dinner.

We arrived at Daemueng Vivaldi Park. We were surprised at the size of the resort, and there was also an Ocean World. <TR>But</TR> because of the cold temperature, we couldn't ride the slides which are connected to the outside of the camp. We ate lunch at the lodgings, and went outside. It was all covered with snow! 
We skied for 4 hours a day. Our teacher taught us how to ski faster and more smoothly. Not just that, but he also told us how to ride safely. ""Safety is the most important thing when we are skiing,"" he said, and I also agree with him. <TR>But</TR>, I can't enjoy the feeling when we are riding a lift. When I see the ground, I can't even move. It is really scary. When I saw the sky, my body almost fell out of the lift, so I couldn't see anything. It was really fun when we speed up and move up and down. The boys in our group always went downhill when teacher was not watching them. When you go downhill, you go so fast that it is almost impossible to stop. I tried once, but it was too fast for me. 
At night, we went to the Ocean World. <TR>But</TR> my friend said she will not go because she hates swimming. <TR>So</TR>, I just played by myself for thirty minutes, and I met my friends in the lodgings and played with them for 2 hours. It was really great! Except there were two girls who kept using swear words to others and grumbling. They also pushed me when I was sitting on the lift. 
The second day, we went skiing for 4 hours again. Our group divided into two teams because there were too many people. There was a boy who was really rude to the girls. <TR>So</TR>, the oldest girl scolded him. It was really delightful to watch. At night, we went downstairs and rode some things like the merry-go-round. <TR>But</TR> there were only PC rooms so most of the girls just went back to the lodgings and watched TV.

We learned about rocks. <TR>At first</TR>, I thought everything was the same and that rocks are boring. In society, we often call a person who is stupid ""rock head."" <TR>So</TR> rocks are usually associated with a bad meaning. <TR>But</TR> now, I think rocks are really important to us. A long time ago, all the continents were united. <TR>But</TR>, because of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, they broke apart. After the volcanic eruptions, the magma started to get solid.

When we arrived at the rest area, we had to take a photo of five people levitating (that means to take a direct picture of people jumping), take a ghoulish photo of someone, and solve nonsense quizes.

<EV>Today, I went to the ""LG Science Land"" in Yeouido.</EV> All the stairs are made of glass. <TR>So</TR> my sister and I had to come down slowly while grabbing each other tightly. LG Science Land also has a different name of ""Twin Towers"". Oh, and I am also a twin. I'm the youngest in my family and I also have a nineteen-year old brother who is tall. There are many scientific machines and futuristic games. It was awesome. My sister and I played a game called ""Robot Soccer"". We can play it with our future cleaning machines. We tried to manipulate the robots and make goals against our opponent's side. <TR>But</TR> no one made any goals. Maybe it's because we were not able to adapt to the future's environment.<TR> Also</TR>, we learned about nutrition and our bodies (like DNA and chromosomes). <TR>Lastly</TR>, we learned about our land, Earth. There are many countries on the Earth, including Korea, China, America, and South Africa. <TR>Even though</TR> we might look different or have different lifestyles, we are still one. We especially need to work together to prevent the dangerous nightmare of global warming. Both the North Pole and South Pole are melting. Because of the melted ice and water, some lands are sinking like Japan. <TR>In my opinion</TR>, when the temperature of the earth become higher than it already is now, no one can live on Earth, even humans. <TR>So</TR> how can we stop this huge disaster? There are many solutions, but there are four main ones. 
<TR>First</TR>, plant many trees. Arbor day is not just a holiday. It is to plant more trees. When we plant seeds and they grow, we can even avoid floods, because the roots of trees help stop water. 
<TR>Second</TR>, use natural shampoo. Most pollution is a result of polluted water. Many shampoos pollute the water. But when we use natural shampoo it doesn't cause as much pollution as normal shampoo.
<TR>Third</TR>, use little energy. When people come home, they usually turn on every light in their house. We can turn on little lights if we need to. I use my light stand when I study late at night,
<TR>Finally</TR>, use public transportation. Ride a bike, take the bus or subway to help use less natural oil and gas. It can also help make you more healthy, especially when you walk to ride a bike. 
<SR>I will practice all of these things and tell everyone that we have to save the Earth!</SR>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Some grammar issues but otherwise it was a good entry.,//

<EV>Last Sunday, two of my uncles, my aunt, Tae-hyeon, Jung-min, my brother Ryan, and I went to eastern Asia's biggest water park.</EV> Its name is 판타시온 워터파크. It is in 영주. It took us 2 hours to get there.

There were many water slides. Most of them were slides that needed tubes. There were tubes for four people, three people, and two people. There was one slide that looked really scary. It has a 75 degree angle! My brother, Jung-min, and I saw that slide and it really scared us. We went to ride some of the most awesome slides. The names were Tornado and Giant Ball. They were rides that needed tubes too. The three of us rode both of them together. Tornado was better than Giant Ball, but Giant Ball was fun too! They go down on a 90 degree angle!!! It was so cool. Both of my uncles rode the slide that looked scary, and they told us it wasn't as scary as it looks!!! <TR>So</TR>, we thought we should try. We went up to that slide and rode it down. It was sort of scary the first time, but it was fun too!!! My brother, my cousin (Jung-min), and I rode that slide 6 times!! It was so fun!!~

We ate lunch and played more. We were out of there by 6 o' clock.

Watching Baseball

<EV>My family went to 대구시민야구장 last Sunday.</EV> We went there to watch a baseball game. It was Samsung Lions vs. KIA Tigers. Of course, I'm a fan of the Samsung Lions. One of the reasons I like that team, is because they're Daegu's team. The other reason is that there is a player whose name is 박한이, and his name is really similar to mine!:)
We got there at 3 o' clock even though the game wouldn't start until 5 o' clock. We sat in our seats for a LONG time. We ate chicken and drank coke. We watched the players practicing.

<TR>Finally</TR>, the game started. Unfortunately, 박한이 didn't play in this game. During the first inning, no one scored. At the Lions's turn in the second inning, the Lions scored. Then the Tigers scored 2 points during the 3rd inning. The Lions scored another point in the 4th inning, and two more points in the 5th inning. They scored again in the 7th inning. The total score was 2:6. The Lions won!! I was so happy!!!

The funny thing is during the 5th inning, at the Lions turn, Treves (KIA Tiger's pitcher) threw the ball and lost 2 points. The next batter was 채태인, and Treves was mad, because he lost 2 points right before. He threw dead balls to 채태인. 채태인 glared at him, and finally, Treves was replaced by another player. Treves said bad things to 채태인, and he was mad too! <TR>So</TR> they started to fight, but the umpires tried to stop them. Both the Lions's and Tigers's players came out to fight. The whole bench cleared. It was so fun!! <TR>But</TR> they settled down after a little bit, and they continued to play baseball.

I got new sneakers on Wednesday. Guess who bought them for me. My mom? Or my dad? NO!! My aunt bought me new sneakers for my birthday!! My mom and dad bought me a new backpack and clothes !!! My sneakers are sooo cool. They're rad!!! REALLY RAD!! The color is red. I like that color. :) Thanks to my Aunt, I got new sneakers!!! I'm so happy!!

 Um....... Remember from my last diary?? About the ""Avatar"" movie? Well, actually I watched it with my friends this Wednesday. It wasn't in 3D, so it wasn't that fun. Again, we just looked through the books and went outside. It was SO hot!! This time, there were more kids than the last time (I think). I finally found a book that is incredibly cool and um.. fun! I can't remember the title. We tried to concentrate on the movie, but it was sort of... boring. :D

 From this Monday to next Friday, I have to go to school at 8:30. Why? Because of TRACK!! :( My school's track team is having practice during summer vacation... ;( There are 4 girls and almost 10 boys on the track team. <TR>But</TR> actually, only about 5 people come to practice. I don't know why the other people don't come. My track teacher said she will buy chicken for the person who comes to practice a lot. She bought us ice cream everyday. The practice is boring and exhausting and stuff, but ice cream is AWESOME!! Maybe the reason I come to practice is to eat ice cream and eat chicken. I come to practice to EAT!!! Ha-ha.

 Well, that was all. Lot of things going on, huh?

You remember the English test? The one I took at Kyeong Book University? The results came out last Friday!! I forgot to post about it, so I will just tell you right now. I PASSED!!! I was SOOOOOO happy!! :D I have to take another test before I can be in the English talented class at Kyeong Book University. It's going to be this Saturday. Wish me luck!! I wish I can pass and then I will be in the English talented class at Kyeong Book University!!!! I'm soooooooooo excited!! My family and I are REALLY HAPPY about this result! My parents told me to study hard for the next test because they want me to get into the gifted class.

Another happy thing!! During summer vacation time, my school's library is still open on weekdays, and on Wednesday, they show us movies!! I called my friends to come to the library and watch the movie together. Unfortunately, only 3 of them were available. The movie started at 10:30. The movie's title was ""The Ant Bully"". I saw this movie when I was young. My mom bought the movie on DVD, and I think I watched it like a thousand times!! <TR>So</TR>, I left the library with my friend. Actually, I met my friends and classmates at the library! <TR>But</TR>, I hung out with Hyeon-Jung. We didn't really want to watch the movie. We were trying to find a fun and exciting novel. It was so dark that we had to use our cell phones as a light to see the books. We couldn't find any fun novels, so we found a cartoon book and read it together. We found our classmates when we were reading. A bunch of boys tried to scare us (I don't really know what they were trying to do, but I think they were trying to scare us). We were reading a scary book (It wasn't really scary, though) and we were so frightened when our friend tried to scare us. It wasn't really fun, so we got out of the library to hang out by ourselves. We bought Colas and snacks because we were both hungry and hot!! We went around the school talking to each other and it was more fun than staying in the library. We went home at around 12:30.

I want to go to the beach this summer. My teacher said not to do in the deep waters, because it is really dangerous and you could die in 20 seconds (I can't remember the exact time). My teacher told my class a story about the ""water demons."" I don't think that water demons are that scary, but I also never believed that real ghosts exist!! <TR>But</TR> my teacher said the story might be not real. He said he doesn't believe in ghosts.

Field Day

You may think that today is field day. <TR>But</TR> it's not........ Field day was on May 7th. It was really great!!!! Now, <EV>I'll tell you about my exciting field day.</EV>

I walked to school as usual, and I went to school at the usual time. I went to my classroom like usual. Nothing was different. When I got to school, I talked with my friends. When the bell rang, my teacher said to bring our chairs and change into our sneakers. The floor of our stadium was wet because it rained, so we had to bring our chairs to sit on during the event.

Field day officially started at 9:00. The 5th and 6th grade students had to stand in the stadium while the other grades had to stay in their seats. I am in the 5th grade as you know, so I had to stand in the stadium. :( My legs became so numb. It was so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll skip the other thing because I don't have any strength to type all that stuff. ^^ Oh yeah, one more thing! I was on the blue team. We had to beat the white team. 

I participated in four events. The first was the competition between the blue team and white team (봉넘기 게임) which was only for the fifth grade. The second was the 100-meter race. The third was the preliminary class relay race. The fourth was the final class relay race which you can participate in only after pass the preliminary race. 

The competition between the blue team and white team was crazy!! :( My team lost...(which was the blue team). We were doing great~!! I don't know why we lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 김재협 told me that our team had more people than the white team. I can't believe 김재협 because he always lies.

The 100 meter race went great!! I won first place. It wasn't fun, though. I don't have any way to describe it. My group was named group 8 (ㅡ_ㅜ), I was in the same group as Min-kyeong and Eun-Chae. There were only 3 people!! It was awesome. You can get a stamp on your arms no matter what place you come in. If you get first place, you get the stamp. If you get second place, you get the stamp. And even when you get third place, you get the stamp!! Isn't that awesome?!

The class relay race was so great!!! During the preliminary race, we won first place. I dropped the baton, but I kept going and we still one first place. We went to the final relay race, and I thought that we couldn't win... :( <TR>But</TR> we really won first place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't really believe it. I ran my best~!!! I don't really remember, though. But I can remember that we won first place!! My teacher was really happy.(ㅋㅋㅋㅋ)

My mom said I am getting fatter, so my dad said I must(?!) do something. My mom suggested Tae-Kwon-Do, but I didn't really want to do it. I said I want to do something like dancing. My mom took me to lots of dance classes last Friday. We went to many academies, but they were all closed (I mean the door was locked). We went to the dance academy I went to when I was in kindergarten. The door was locked too. My mom called the director of the academy, and she came. The director changed. It was a ballet academy. I sort of had a mind to start doing ballet again. I really liked ballet when I was young. <TR>So</TR> I told my mom that I want to do ballet. My mom agreed and had a consultation with the director. I will go to the academy on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. I have to go to the 영재교육원 on Wednesday, so I can't do ballet on Wednesday. <TR>But</TR> sometimes, there are weeks when I don't go to 영재교육원. If I don't have to go, I will go to ballet on Wednesday instead of Tuesday and I will go to the academy at 5:30. I have to go class at 4:30 on Tuesady. <TR>But</TR>, if I go to the academy on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, I have to go at 5:30. The 4:30 class ends at 5:30 and the 5:30 class ends at 7:00. The 5:30 class is more advanced. 

I can't bring back my memories. I can't remember anything about ballet....... I don't have any ballet clothes. My teacher said she will give it to me next time. I want a pretty dress!! 

Oh man~~ I have to go now! It's time for me to go to ballet class~! Wish me good luck?!",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,"The big paragraph really should have been divided into two paragraphs, which would have helped it be read easier. But it was a fine essay, other than needing some more transitions.",//

[BIG TEST~!!!]

<EV>Today, my school took midterm exams.</EV> The midterm exams are big tests. I studied hard to take the exams.

We took exams in Korean, math, S.S. (social studies), science, and English.

I think I got two questions wrong. During the Korean exam, I wrote the wrong answer for the dictation problem. <TR>And</TR> during the math exam, I wrote the wrong answer again for question number 8. The answer was 7, but I wrote 171....ㅜㅜ

I really wanted to get everything right. I hope I only got those two problems wrong. My mom said I did great, but I don't really feel satisfied.

I think some of my friends are going to get all hundreds!! ,TR>And</TR> then I will have a stomachache. I want to get all hundreds too~!! Maybe I'll have another chance next time......
I wish my teacher will announce our grades tomorrow. I am not going to like it though...ㅡㅡ
I wish that I will do better next time...

I played a lot today!! That's because the exams are over and my mom lets me play with my friends. Today, it rained. <TR>So</TR>, we couldn't play outside. <TR>So</TR>, we went to eat something........ We went to Can more. It has yummy foods on the menu. We ate and ate.^^ I played and played.

I wish my teacher will announce the grade for our exams tomorrow!!!",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,"The flow of thought in the essay seemed to jump around a little bit. The thoughts could have been organized better, and with transitions it would have been easier to follow.",//

[Jumping Rope]

<EV>My school held a jump roping competition on 3/28.</EV> It wasn't the kind of jump roping you are thinking of. It was a team jump roping competition. It is different from other kinds of team jump roping like the 꼬마야 꼬마야 game. There are two people turning the ropes. This is how it works. They turn it and the jumping people run past the rope. They go on and on and on until the time ends. The time is 2 minutes. The team with the greatest record wins! My class won first place in the fifth grade. We won third place in the competition against every class in our whole school. We won the dodgeball event too. 

Our school has to compete in the inter-school match. The first, second and the third place winners of the final competition get to compete in the inter-school match. The Physical Education teacher picked out 16 students to join the match. Almost every girl in my class is part of the 16 students.

The 16 students must practice after second period. The longest break is after second period. It is 20 minutes long. We have to practice jump roping....... Some of my friends are having a jump roping rope slump. The P.E teacher makes the student turning the rope go faster..... I don't really like the P.E teacher. She isn't really nice.

Well, the competition is in May. Wish me good luck!!ㅡㅡ

P.S I'm so sorry that I wrote such a short diary entry!! I promise that I will write more next time~!!^^",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,The explanation of the competition was fine but the lack of transitions really hurt the flow.,//

My teacher changed on Monday, but I didn't have much time to write a diary entry about it then. <EV><TR>So</TR>, I will write about the new teacher right now.</EV>

My old teacher was Meoung-Ah Kim (김명아선생님) teacher, but she was pregnant and went on a special leave to have a baby. <TR>So</TR>, she had to get a new teacher to teach my class. She tried to select the best teacher she could find. She picked Chang-Won Lee (이창언선생님) to be our new teacher. As you can see by the name, the new teacher is a man. A male teacher is very rare at our school. There is only one other male teacher in our school. The girls in our class like that teacher. He is better than I thought he would be. I thought that an ugly old teacher would come and teach us when my old teacher told us that the new teacher would be a man. <TR>But</TR>, he isn't ugly. He is sort of handsome but not that much. I would guess that he is about 28 years old. He looks very young. The sixth graders like my new teacher. 

The new teacher is very good at teaching. It's fun. My new teacher is also new to this school. <TR>So</TR> , I had to introduce myself to my new teacher. That's because I'm the class president. I think he knows almost everything now. 

I am sort of fond of my new teacher. He has a great sense of humor. It is very fun learning with him. My old teacher said that he is so good that our class might cry when it is time for him to leave. Well, that's not going to happen though.-- -- My old teacher will come back in July, I think. I saw it on the notice board.

I think this is his first time teaching! Maybe he was only practicing his teaching before and my class is the first class that he is actually teaching.

<CO><TR>So</TR>, I think that's all I know about my new teacher. I wish that I can have a great time with him.</CO> See you next time~~",::,4,::,4,::,2,::,3,::,Some more transitions would have helped but overall this was a good entry.,//
"721&4/7 [OMG! Terrible news in Japan!]

I think all of you know what I am talking about in the title. <EV>On March 11th, there was a really big earthquake in Japan.</EV> It was a 9.0 magnitude earthquake. I think that it was the biggest earthquake in the whole world. I have a friend in Japan. I was so worried when I heard the news. I ran to my room and turned on my computer and sent an e-mail to my friend (I don't know her phone number). She didn't reply quickly, so I thought something terrible happened to her. To my relief, she was okay. She said she lives in the middle part of Japan, so she didn't experience any damage. 

I am so worried about Japan. If I think about the past, I don't really want to help them. That's because in the past, we were colonized by Japan. <TR>But</TR> it wasn't their fault that the earthquake happened. I am not an evil person, so I gave 2000 won to help Japan. Actually, it was part of our school's project;;. 

If there was no Japan, I think we could have gotten both the tsunami and the earthquake. We can say thanks to Japan. <TR>But</TR>, we have bad news too. We will have to be careful because of the radiation that was leaked when the atomic power station (nuclear plant) of Japan exploded because of the earthquake and the tsunami. 

You know what? South Korea is also in danger of much damage. <TR>Because of</TR> the leaking radiation, you have to be more aware of radioactivity. You know that it was raining today in Korea? You shouldn't have been exposed to the raindrops because there is some radiation in the raindrops. I am so afraid! My mom said that even if you get exposed to the raindrops as long as you wash it very well, the radiation will come off and you will be safe.

If you don't know much about radiation, you may think what's the big deal about getting exposed to radioactivity.....

If you get exposed to the radiation, you may get cancer or another severe disease. It is a scary thing.-_-

I hope you will not get exposed to radioactivity~!!!! You will have to get it off as soon as you can!! Plus, you shouldn't go outside often.

Good luck to all of us!!",::,3,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,"More transitions would have helped this entry, but otherwise it was good.",//

<EV>Tomorrow, I have to go to the Academy for Gifted Kids</EV>. Do you know what the Academy for Gifted Kids is? I'll tell you......

I don't remember the exact date, but I took a test in December of 2011. I took the test at my school. The purpose of the test is to pick out three kids from our school to go to the academy. I was one of the three kids. 10 days later, I went to take a test at the Seoung-Dong Elementary School. It was harder than the first test. There were more than 200 kids from all over Deagu. I was very nervous. <TR>But</TR>, I passed!! They chose 20 kids and I was one of them~~~!!!! The Academy for Gifted Kids is called 영재교육원 in Korean. It is a class where students learn harder things. You can go there after you pass two tests. I am very lucky~~~

I am very excited right now!! Tomorrow is my first class at the academy. I wish that I will have a great time at the academy~~! When I saw the main subject, I felt that I am going to have a good time! A very good time!!! I can't wait until tomorrow.....

I have to go to the academy once a week. The best part of the academy for my mom is that it is free. The country pays for the tuition to the academy. I have to stay there for 2 hours and 40 minutes. <TR>But</TR> if I count the time I have to wait until the class starts and the time I have to spend to go to the academy, if I add stuff like that, I think that it will take more than 4 hours!!!

I know 4 hours is a really long time, but I think the time will fly by because it will be fun~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I went to the orientation at Hwang Gum Middle School last week. The teacher said that I have to bring my picture and stuff like that tomorrow. I am both nervous and happy.

To be honest, I am not really good at hard math and hard science. I wish that I can adjust to the class easily. It can be hard, but I'm going to try my best. I wish that the teachers will be really kind. I don't like mean teachers.

Hi~ Do you remember me? I'm back~! <EV>As you can already see by the title, my class held elections for class president.</EV> I didn't have the election today, but I want to write about it today.

I had the election on... I'm not sure, but I think it was March 7th. I knew I should have written in this journal before March 10th. Now, I can't even remember the details. <TR>But</TR> I'll try my best to remember. :)

We held the election during the second period. I have bad memories from class president elections. When I was in 2nd grade, I ran for class president. Someone else from my class and I were tied at first place. We had a second election, and we got voted equally. What I mean by ""voted equally"" is... for example, I got 16 votes and someone else from my class also got 16 votes, that means we were voted equally. I wasn't really sure how to say that, so I just made it up. ^^ <TR>Anyway</TR>, our teacher said that we were tied, so we should do the next step. She said the next step is to compare our birthdays. I was born in August, and the other student was born in January. He was born earlier than me! That meant he would be the class president! <TR>So</TR>, that's my sad memory. Plus, I have only been class vice president once before. <TR>But</TR. on the election day this year, I thought I am in fifth grade, and in 2nd and 3rd grade, there are lots of students who run for class president, but if you get older, there are fewer students running for class president. <TR>So</TR>, I decided to go for it. Another boy and I were the only students running for class president! Fortunately, I got 15 votes and he got 12 votes. I was elected to be the class president!!! I'm so glad.

<SR>Now that I'm the class president, I will do anything for my school! Well, not anything, but I'll try my best.</SR>

<TR>So</TR> that's it!

<EV>Today, after dinner, we played the five in a row tournament again</EV>. I was not really happy, because I didn't want to do the tournament again. <TR>But</TR>, my mom said it would be fun, so I finally agreed. I was perfectly sure that I would lose today. 

<TR>First</TR>, my mom and my dad played against each other. My mom won very easily. My dad was so focused on putting down the stone, and didn't see my mom's stone. <TR>After</TR> my mom and dad's game, Ryan and I played against each other. Remember when Ryan won the tournament on December 27th? Before I played, I was sure that I was going to lose. Well, I was right. I did lose. He beat me. We were playing with difficult strategies, and it was so complicated that the game didn't end until after 20 minutes. Now, I was guaranteed to lose the whole tournament. My dad and I played again. I got pretty sick of playing five in a row. I really didn't like the game. <TR>But</TR> when I win, I always think that five in a row is the best game ever! Well, you might think that I'm a selfish girl, but everyone thinks that way. Almost everyone has greed and desires. Anyway, I almost won, but I didn't see the paduk stone, so, my dad won. I knew that I was going to lose! Well, I think I have to do better than this next time. I don't want to lose all the time. Now, let's go on to my mom Vs. Ryan. They played like pros. They did a whole lot better than I did. Probably because they are the 1st and 2nd in our family. I watched their game, and it took like 1 hour! Well, I know that it is an exaggeration, but it felt like 1 hour. I think it was closer to 20 minutes in actual time. The final result is that my mom won! I felt a lot better. I wanted my mom to win. Well, I know I didn't win, but I felt better anyway. Oh man! I lost this time.

<EV>Light is something we need to live and if there were no light on Earth such as sunlight, no plants or no life would be excited on the Earth, and just darkness would be left all days and nights.</EV>
Light is also the thing that represents Gwanju, where the 2010 World Light Expo took place.
There were many kinds of exhibits about light such as light theater, the light industry, the future life of light, a photonics exhibit, and Phlooks(?)'s light museum which was also called, ""빛 희노애락관.""
희 means happiness, 노 means anger, 애 means sadness, and last of all, 락 means excitement about life. All of them are feelings we can have during a lifetime.
The light theater is where you can enjoy watching a movie called Seed Light, and it is about a robot that uses light as a weapon, fighting with a villian called ""Devils of darkness.""
The light industry is the most popular in Gwanju, so most people should see that.
It shows the light technology in Gwanju by showing 3D TV, or a laser show that is about Earth's birth.
You can understand or even predict the future light industry in Gwanju, or your own region.
Photonics are the study of light or communication using light.
You can experience what is different about the speed and accuracy of the information sent between a copper wire and a optical fiber(광섬유). You can also learn about how you can see and about electricity.
As I told you before, you can also experience life in the future using light.
<TR>Before</TR> entering the exhibit, you might wait for a minute, (if you're lucky, you won't) because you will experience life without light. <TR>After</TR> the instructor's instruction, the light will be out for a minute, and when the lights are on, most people are hugging each other and I also hugged my mom tightly. When the experience is over, the next thing is the thing you can do in the future by using your cell phone! Whan an amazing system! Oh, I guess I forgot something else.
It's the exhibit called Fell the Sun. When you enter the building, you can learn more about sunlight energy, and do you know what?!
All the energy that is used at the expo is made by sunlight!!!
<TR>Well</TR>, that's not all. There are another 3 exhibits when you go there. <TR>So</TR>, if you want to figure it out, don't miss it!!! It's until May 9th!
<TR>And</TR> for the end, don't lose your hope, keep your light on your mind.

"731&<EV>There are still some pirates sailing around the sea.</EV>
They still steal things just like the old ones.
Uh oh! <TR>But</TR> don't think of the Hollywood pirates.
There are many stories and movies about pirates.
I would like to recommend the move called ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""
It was directed by Gregor Verbinski.
He was born in America in 1964.
There is a famous story about pirates who wanted treasure, but they never get to the treasure. What is it?
Yes, it is a story called, ""Treasure Island.""
It is still famous even though it was written many years ago!
As you read through the story, you will probably find a picture of a pirate's flag, hanging up on the boat instead of the Union Jack, the flag of England.
Like the English flag that has its own name, the pirate's flag also has its own name.
It is called the ""Jolly Roger"", and it has a big skull in the middle of it, and at the at the bottom part of it, it has two bones crossing each other like the letter ""X.""
<TR>But</TR>, not all of them looks like that. Some of them draw the hourglass on the flag, and it doesn't have much sand left in the hourglass.
That means the time of death is coming soon.
Do you think you are safe because you don't have to go where pirates live unless you are a diplomat?
<TR>Well</TR>, actually your prediction is wrong.
There are new kinds of pirates now, and they are called the ""digital pirates"".
They download or copy people's programs without giving them money or getting permission.
They use that program to make lots of money and act like they made that program.
They sometimes take some personal information or national information and sell it to others.
It can cause war if people continue doing that. <TR>So</TR>, what can we do? 
To protect us from digital pirates, write some words that say, ""Please don't copy without my permission"", and it is good to put your name or signature on your picture or story.
You had better change your ID or your password regularly and you must not tell anyone that ID or password.
<TR>Then</TR>, how can we protect ourselves from the real pirates in Somalia?
<TR>Well</TR>, the navy and the coast guard will protect us.
You can think that they are kind of the police that work at sea.
They will protect you from the pirates.
<CO><TR>Well</TR>, now that we know all about pirates, we are safe now, aren't we?</CO>",::,3,::,2,::,1,::,3,::,"There needed to be some kind of transition between how the pirates were depicted in fiction and the pirates that exist now.

"732&<EV>Have you looked at the sky during the day?</EV>
I think you have been noticing the sun. The sun is actually one of the stars, and the planet that we live on, Earth, is orbiting around it.
Earth also rotates by itself, and because of it, there are days and nights now.
It is also the other reason why there are 4 seasons each year.
<TR>Now,</TR> look at the sky at night. What can you see?
As you have said, you are be able to see the moon and some stars sparkling in the sky like jewels.
Have you ever wondered why there aren't stars during the day?
It's because the sun shines more brightly than stars.
<TR>Now</TR> that there is the sun on the other side of Earth, you can see the stars!
<TR>Then</TR>, how about the moon?
The moon actually does not shine. It just reflects the light from the sun.
It also orbits around Earth while Earth is orbiting the sun!
<TR>Now</TR> that we learned about our view of the sky during the day and night, how about watching the night sky on the weekends with your friends, or your family?
I would like to recommend you to look at some stars in the countryside.
<TR>Because</TR> the city is too bright and so noisy, you can't see that many stars in the city.
It's better when you watch them on the mountain top and with a telescope.
Mountains are more silent and dark, and the telescope can help you to see much better!
The chirping sound of crickets, with clear air to breathe...
<TR>And</TR> some bright campfire in the middle of the night with some marshmallows cooking!
What a great view to imagine!

"733&<EV>Hats are worn to cover the head.</EV>
Hats are the things that you wear on your head.
There are many kinds of hats and they are used for many purposes.
Some people wear them for protection, while others wear them for their beauty.
Hats are made with a variety of materials.
The weather often helps to determine which material would be best.
It also depends on the purpose of the hat.
<TR>For example</TR>, if you wear a straw hat, you may live in a hot region, because straw hats protect you from the sun and heat.
<TR>So,</TR> that's why farmers usually wear straw hats.
<TR>But</TR>, if your hat is made with thick wool, you may live in a cold region such as Alaska, which is one of the states in the U.S.A.
<TR>And, for another example,</TR> a silk hat with flowers for decoration would definitely be for our beauty.
These days, hat are used as symbols too!
Just think of something, and draw the best thing that symbolizes the word that I say.
<TR>So,</TR> first think of Christmas. What can you imagine?
Yes! You can imagine Santa's hat! A red thick hat that protects Santa from cold air!
<TR>Then,</TR> if you think of a witch, you can think of a black hat that has a cone in the middle of the hat.
To give more examples, instead of the cone being straight, sometimes the point of it is a little loose, or sometimes, there are some decorations at the end of the cone.
<TR>So</TR> funny, isn't it? <CO>There are more and more kinds of hats these days, and many more hats are being made, or invented by other people right at this moment!
<TR>Now,</TR> how about wearing a hat tomorrow?

Avatar was directed by James Cameron.
He is a Canadian director.
When he was young, his mind was taken by science fiction, and that's why he became a director.

He had seen <2001 Space Odyssey> and he started to make short movies.

<TR>And</TR> he made a new movie called Avatar last year, and for the first time in Korean history, over ten million people saw that movie, including you and I!
It changed the record in Hollywood too! What a great movie!
The main character of that movie was Jake Sherrly, and he wasn't able to walk, because his leg was disabled.
He lost his twin brother who was one of the agents of the ""Avatar Project.""
All of the work and training that Jake's brother had done became nothing.
<TR>But, unexpectedly,</TR> Jake was hired as one of the agents of the ""Avatar Project,"" because he had the same DNA as his brother.

Making snowmen is for everyone!

To make a snowman, you need snow, and some other decorations for the snowman.
<TR>First</TR>, make two snowballs. The first one must be big, and the second one must be smaller than the first one, but not that small.
<TR>Next</TR>, put the second snowball on the first one.
<TR>Now,</TR> you can decorate the snow!
<TR>For example,</TR> like Ricky the raccoon, you can make your eyes and mouth with raisins and your nose with a carrot!
<TR>Also</TR> you can put some branches for hands, and some old hats and mittens for him!
Can you imagine how they will look like?
You can make another kind of snowman with three snowballs.
<TR>But</TR> it is much harder!
<TR>Usually,</TR> some parts of the neighborhood will end playing all of those, but we don't.
There is a special road and a hill near the Seogu Culture Center.

were very nice and calm. In the morning, we gave a presentation about our school and exchanged gifts. 

From Japan, they gave us a calender with their school's picture, along with a towel and flag that represented 

their symbol. From our school, we gave them two paintings of the ocean that lays just in front of our 

school. I think we should have given them something that represents our school. Then they gave a presentation about 

Japan. Each student came to the front to show and talk to us about all the great places we can visit in 

Japan.Then our choir sang ""With Our Own Two Hands"" and showed the slideshow of pictures of our school 

life. Then the teachers chose a partner for us and we spent the rest of our day with them playing games 

from Canada and Japan. I had so much fun! They felt so familiar to me because I lived most of my 

life in Japan and it's been so long since I didn't speak Japanese. I also had a chance to talk about 

the situation in Japan. I asked them about how the earthquake and nuclear reaction was. But as I had 

expected, they said it was getting worse and worse. Even scientists have said that they should be 

careful for next ten years. Anyway, when school ended and they left, I missed them. I wished I could play 

and talk with them more. I also wish I will have another chance to meet them in the future.",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,Some grammar issues but otherwise this was good.,//
"754&Today, the seventh grade students had a band field trip, so we (the sixth graders) had a lot of free time. We did an art project for most of the time. In the morning, we chose one question about our environment. My question was WHY DO WE DESTROY OUR PLANET? In the middle, I drew an earth that was destroyed. It didn't have any green and the land was burning. And in the background, I drew some natural disasters, along with all the garbage and vehicles making pollution.

After this project, we did art again. This time, we outlined our face in the picture and painted it with watercolor. When I finished outlining, I was so surprised. It looked exactly like me! Oh my god!! Seriously, it looked so alike.Then I painted my hair and clothes in rainbow colors. I colored the background rainbow too. It was my best self portrait I've ever drawn.

After lunch, we went to Ambleside Park. It's only a few minutes away and I would rather call it a beach than a park. This is one of the great things about our school. When we have time, we sometime go to the nearby park or beach. I lay on the big concrete which is in the middle of the water. It shows itself when the water is out. It was very relaxing. I wasn't able to hear anything except for the wave and the birds. But most of my friends went into the water. They actually put their whole body in!! All of their clothes and hair were wet. Then I found my other friend sitting under the tree. So I spent the rest of the time sitting with her, talking. Also, there was a seal! It was molting under the sun and it kept on farting!! It smelled so bad!! I wanted to look closer, but there was a fence and the smell was killing my nose.

They were going around to 12 countries and Canada was the first country they went to and our school was the first school they visited. And my class was the only class that was able to work on it. We were special! We worked on this project from morning to noon. When it was done, it was great! It was the best work that I've done with a group. I think I could have done it better. Ha ha ha. It would just take a lot of time. They also gave us some treats. It was Pocky and other Japanese snacks. Because I lived in Japan since I was 1 years old, it was very familiar to me.

Since it was my first audition for anything, I was so nervous. Just one hour before the audition, I even yelled that I didn't want to go. And my voice was absolutely closed and I thought I would fail. BUT!! Today, I got an e-mail that said... CONGRATULATIONS!! When my mom told me, I thought she was lying.

Today, the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th grade student at my school watched a play. It was the first story of Narnia. There were only two actors, so they kept changing their characters. It started in the attic with a wardrobe that led to Narnia. If I were them, I would be so nervous in front of so many people. For an hour, they spoke without stopping. They changed their character by changing their costume with things near them. I couldn't hold my surprise! And their acting was so good! But I still liked the movie better. I was also surprised at how they were able to talk without stopping for 1 hour. Their voices didn't tremble at all!

Today, I went on a field trip, but this field trip was only for the band students. We went to the Orpehum downtown and saw the VSO rehearsing for their concert this afternoon. VSO stands for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and it was for adults. They have to audition to be in it. There were 21 violins and violas, 5 cellos, 5 contrabass, and more woodwind instruments that I didn't know the names of. Most of them were adults, but surprisingly, there was one boy who played the piano. I heard from the staff that he is only 13 years old, but he was SO good at piano. I couldn't even see his fingers moving. From what I heard, he won at a concert and they wanted to invite him to play.

After the rehearsal was done, we looked around the Orpheum and walked to the mall food-court to eat lunch. I ate a burger at A&W. Since I was so hungry, it tasted great. Then we had 20 minutes for shopping. Since we had to team up, I teamed up with my friend Mia. We went to many stores. First, we went to the Apple store to check out new technologies. Then we went to some clothing stores and make up shops. It was my first time being in the make up shop with a friend, but it was fun. Then we went to a shop called Bath and BodyWorks. They had all sorts of good things for our skin. I bought a hand gel and case that matched the color of the gel my friend bought, but her's was a different smell.

But if you want to be in the Special Choir, you have to audition for it. And if you get in, you have to come to school early on Wednesdays. In this choir you can learn more about music and singing.

Some of them went to the U.S.A and Mexico and many of them went to Whistler at least once. Whistler is one of the most popular tourist places in Vancouver and Canada. It's the mountain where the 2010 Vancouver Olympics took place. It's also famous for skiing, but it's very expensive. When it was my turn, there wasn't much to say since I didn't go anywhere in particular. So I talked about going to math camps and skiing at Grouse Mountain. Grouse Mountain is the mountain located near my house and is cheaper.^^ In Vancouver, since the weather is cold, they don't use human-made snow at all. There is only real snow on the mountains.

It was like a small lake. Beside it were small rocks. It was hard to walk on it, but it was fun and adventurous. Since most of the rocks were slippery, one of the boy slipped his foot.

It wasn't hard but there was a lot of multiplying and dividing. After some math, we had a break. During our break, we played a card game. It was called Go-Fish. It was so much fun! In English class, we talked about the book which we had to finish yesterday in one day. It wasn't that long but the other three students only read half of it! Well... the teacher didn't explode, but she was a little bit mad since we had to do the questions from the story. While the others were trying to read as much as they could, the other girl and I got to do nothing.

And lastly, I showed her HACE. In Korea or Japan, they don't have this subject. It's short for Health and Career Education.

But our school choir and four other schools had to rehearse for 2 hours. When we were rehearsing, the high school choir told us what to fix and what was good. I immediately knew that they were great singers and great teachers. At 4 o'clock, the concert started, and we were 4th. As I watched others sing, I wondered what our choir looks like when we sing. When it was our turn, we went to the stage. There were more people than I thought, and the spotlights were very bright. At first my leg shook a bit, but I got used to it.

There were many things happening today, at my school. Today was Valentine's day. It’s a very big event in Canada. Many people think it’s the day when girls give boys chocolates, but it’s actually a day for friendship too! We did many things at school. Since it was a special day, our class had a party as usual. Our teacher showed us a movie and we shared our treats. There was popcorns, Doritos, chips, gummies and some other things. Some people, including me, brought some chocolates. I heard many people appreciated them.
Also the student council sold bracelets for two bucks to earn money for a fundraiser. For a few weeks, the sixth and seventh grades were busy making them. I wondered if I should buy some or at least one to help them, but I decided to make my own later. But some of my friends bought some and gave it to their friends. Later, I had some regret about not getting any. 
It was also school spirit day. So, we had to wear Hollyburn’s color blue or our school’s shirt. On our shirt, it's written, ""I love Hollyburn"" on the middle of the shirt. We made it because our school turned 100 years old last year (2012). At the assembly, we talked about a volleyball game, which only the seventh graders are allowed to play, and also about our friendships. Teachers showed us two videos. One was a BFF (Best Friend Forever) song. I didn’t really like the song, but I was able to see the message of the song. The other video was about bullying. Bullying happens no matter where we are. We, our school’s students, are trying very hard to block it, at least at our school. I really feel and felt sorry for those who are getting bullied.
We also had visitor from West Vancouver High School for the choir. The West Vancouver District was having a new choir for people who were interested about it. We have to audition for it, so West Vancouver High School’s choir teacher came and talked about it. It seemed very fun and interesting. They had all these concerts!

Today, I had a practical course class.

The class teacher is my best teacher.

So, I love it.

But, today practical course was terrible.

Loosely translated, I learned some terrible things in practical course class.



I learned how animals are raised.

They live in very small rooms.

And it stressed me a lot.

First, I saw some chicks.

The male chicks are killed as they come out of the eggs.

The crusher grinds male chicks.

And people cut female chicks' beaks.

Second, I saw pigs.

They live in very small rooms.

When they are bears, people cut their teeth, and tail.

I know people are very cruel to living things all the time, but this is not good.



Now, many animals suffer from people.

I think, people should respect animals.

Animals are living things, and they have a right to be happy.

I will protect animals when I grow up.

""I think, Cambodia has many more melons than Korea."" 
So I said,
""We should have prepared some traditional food from Korea. For example, miso soup and pan-fried food.""
And another said,
""Yes. Why did they prepare a cake? They did not give us that food.""
And another said too,
""Give us the cake and the melons, and give the Cambodian teachers the pan-fried food!""

During our English class, we solved some English quizzes with the iPad. When I solved three quizzes, a woman said something. But I didn't know what she said. She asked me, ""Can I take a picture?""
So I said,
""Sure.""
""Say cheese~~""
A man sat next to me. I was so surprised. I didn't know the Cambodian teachers came to English class.
The man is a Cambodian teacher. So I saw the camera and made a ""V"" with my hand. And I smiled at the camera.

"782&The test

Last week, I couldn't write in my diary because we had to take the test in school last week.
I am embarrassed to brag, but I tend to be smart.
^^; Sorry..^^;

Now, I'll tell you about the test.


For my first class, I had the Korean test.
My mother is good at Korean.

DUring the second class, I had the math test!
Oh... I didn't study for the math.
So I was very worried.

In my next class, I had the English test.
English at school is very easy.
I want the English class at school to be more difficult.
That is because I want to learn more challenging English!
Anyway, when the English test was finished, my teacher told me the result of my math test.
......
I received a perfect score of 100!!!!!! Yeah~~~
In my class, I was the only one to get the grade of 100 in math.

In my fourth class, I had the social studies test.
This was very easy. My teacher made this test.
Oh teacher! Thank you!

For my last class, I had the science test.
This test was crazy.
Some questions didn't have an answer, and others 


Yesterday, my teacher told me my test results.

The Korean test's result is 99.





(Oh my god!!!)






The math test's result is 100.








(I knew about that.)








The English test's result is 100.








(Phew! I am lucky.)










The social studies test's result is.....100!!!!!!!!!










(Wow!!!!!)










The science test's result is................................















100!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




















Yeah~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am very happy.
But unfortunately, I lost one point!
If I correct that one question, maybe I can get all 100s!

"783&Why I couldn't write last week's diary

Last week, I couldn't write in my diary.
Why I couldn't write last week's diary?
It was because I changed my computer last week.

Last Monday, I decided to write my seventh diary entry on Wednesday instead because I was feeling very tired and sleepy that day.
I can't remember why I was tired and sleepy.
And Wednesday is my free day.
But I thought it would be useful to practice my English,so I opened a website.
...
Oh, my. There was a problem with the internet. 
For the last few days, my computer was very slow.
When I wanted to use the computer, I felt like it was a test of patience.
Oh!! So, we ordered a computer from an online store.
My father ordered a computer, and he wasn't that happy about it.

Anyway, on Wednesday, our new computer came~~ Yeah~~
We pressed the switch to start this computer.
Pit-a-pat Pit-a-pat
...
But nothing happened. So we returned it.
And that night, my father went out to order a new computer from the store.

And on Friday evening, the new computer came.

Our sixth grade has had disturbances because of school violence.
Two girls suffered lightly from many girls.

I heard about the first incident from my teacher. 
A girl had an argument with another girl.
So they broke off their friendship.
And one girl talked behind the other girls' back to her friends.
They were so angry that they maliciously alienated the other girl at her school.

I heard about the second incident from my friend on our way to my house today.
A girl transferred to my school last year.
It happened a short time ago.
She wrote a sentence on her Kakaostory.
She attached two pictures.
One was of a girl, and another was of paste.
This girl suffered lightly. 
The sentence was,
""I want to put paste on her lips...""
And many girls wrote many comments.


So two girls suffered lightly from many girls.
They went to We-class a child guidance clinic in my school.
And they told the We-class teacher about those incidents.
And, many of the girls' crimes have been brought to light.

When I became a judge, I will inflict penalties on students like them.
But, I will fix their character too.",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,The story was confusing. In particular the third paragraph was a little confusing. Transitions would have helpeed the essay flow better.,//
"785&Birthdays

Why did I write the title ""Birthdays''?
Because this week I had two birthday parties.
One was my friend Dabin's birthday, and the other was my mother's birthday.
First, I'll tell you about my friend Dabin's birthday!

I went to Readership camp. Originally, only monitors and 부반장들 went to this camp. But this year, studio members can go too. So I went to this camp and then I went to her birthday party.
In Lotteria, many friends sat in their chairs and talked. Dabin was delighted to see me. We went to karaoke. But some friends didn't get to sing any songs because one person sang too many times. Oh, I don't like her. I've got a grudge against her. Anyway, I played a lot.

And my mother's birthday...
Our family always celebrates birthdays in the morning. So yesterday we celebrated my mother's birthday like a dream.

Mother, Dabin! Happy Birthday!!!",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,Some grammar issues and lack of transitions but otherwise this was ok.,//
"786&Title : Studio members are so busy

If you read my first diary, then you will know that I am a studio member.
Last year, I thought that when I became a studio member, it would be nice and good.
But today I realized that being a studio member means that I have to work harder.

It was music class. I like music class because my music teacher is a very good teacher. In 2011, she was in charge of my class. She is quite a competent teacher. So I like her. This year, she is teaching music classes. Anyway, for that music class she prepared music golden bell. When I took out my music notes, I heard, ""An Soo-yeon! Studio!""
""What?""
I looked behind me and I saw my studio teacher. He said, ""Come out! You must replace the mics in the auditorium!""
I thought, ""Oh, no!""
And my music teacher said,
""No! Don't go, Soo-yeon!""
I didn't want to go. But I am a studio member, so I had to go.
""Bye!""
When I got there, there were some students' parents. Then, another studio member came to me, and she said, ""Oh! The studio teacher came while we were studying English...""
Why did we have to go there? It was because of the Parents General Assembly. 
And we worked, worked, worked. And we also had some rest time. During that time, I made a hanger. It was so nice! So the studio members can hang their jumpers. They should thank me. Hahaha! When it was the end of the Parents General Assembly, there were many chairs. At least... 300? So we put away several hundred chairs. There were only five children to put away several hundred chairs... Wow...
It was around 3:40pm by the time we finished. We went to the studio teacher and we elected the head of the studio. And... I am the head of the studio from today! Yeah~~~ Than, I heard,""Ding-Dong-Dang-Dong~ Ah, ah. Teachers, please come to the auditorium. Let's put away the chairs! Ding-Dong-Dang-Dong~""
We shouted,""What? We put away the chairs! How..""
So we went to the auditorium again. There were no chairs. The teachers were also there. And they said, ""Where are the chairs?""
So we said,""We put away all the chairs.""
The teachers praised us. And then we went to the studio, and used a camera, a tripod, and charger.
Oh! The studio members are so busy!",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,Overall this essay was fine except for the big paragraph in the middle. That confused me and I wasn't entirely sure what's going on.,//
"787&In my last diary entry, I wrote about my birthday. March 5th was my birthday. But on March 9th, I had a birthday party. I invited my friends who sang me a song and gave me letters when it was my birthday. When I told my mom about my friends, my mother said,
""Oh, really? Then this Saturday you can have your birthday party.""
And my mother gave 50000 won to me for my birthday party.

The schedule was:
1. Meet friends.
2. Go to Lotteria and eat some hamburgers.
3. Go to karaoke and sing songs.
4. Go to Y-teen fancy store and do some shopping.
5. Play as much as we can. 

So we ate hamburgers. That was very nice. We ate chicken burgers. I think my friends might have eaten cheap food because they would feel sorry to me for eating something expensive. But I had 50000 won, so I could actually buy expensive food that time. 
At karaoke, we sang many songs. But then they covered up my eyes. And I heard them sing,
""Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday dear Soo-yeon~♪""
And they gave me some presents. I unwrapped a package. Inside, there was a mug, a key hanger of Americas growth, secret diary, pen set, an item ticket, and so on... I was so happy!!! ^^*

As far as I know, I must write at least one diary entry per week. But, I wanted to write more than one this week. Because, today is my birthday!! Yeah~~
During my school's first break time, some of my friends visited my class. They are from another class. They gave letters to me! And they said,
""Sorry. I don't have your present. Tomorrow, I'll give a present to you.""
So I said,
""Oh, thank you. But you don't need to give me presents.""
But they didn't listen to what I said.
And another friends sang to me, 
""Happy birthday to you~ Happy birthday to you~♪"" because she didn't have a letter. 
After, I thought,
""Oh, I have many good friends..""

"789&Title : School

Today, I am shocked. I'll talk later about the reason why I am shocked.

I am a studio member. Only six students in the whole school are studio members. Many students want to become studio members and they need to take a test. I was elected to be a member of the studio. So today, I went to the lecture hall early because we, thje studio members, must set up the microphone and platform.
I met my best friend, Na-yeon. She went to Chicago to learn English. And she just came back! Oh, I was glad to see her!
When we finished doing our work, the studio teacher said,
""You can go to your new classroom and come back here.""
At that time, we didn't know who my teacher was, and what is my class number. So the other members and I each went to our classrooms.

My class number is 4. And my teacher is a man! Oh, I didn't have any school years with a man in charge of my classes until now. But.. Now! So when I saw my teacher, I was shocked. So, I couldn't say hello to my new teacher, and I came back quickly. Oh, my god.

But one good thing is that my music teacher is Sim soo-min teacher who was in charge of my fourth grade class before. She is a very good teacher. And she is young, and pretty. I like her.

Ha... I don't have any best friends. Ji young was my best friends when I was 11. But today, she played with children from another class! So, I played with my other friends. Tomorrow is my birthday, and they know that it will be my birthday! Oh, my heart was too full for words. I like them so much!

I love you my friends

"790&Date : Monday February 10th, 2013 

Weather : Clear day but with a biting wind 


Today, I grow older. Every morning, I have my father wash my hair. Because in morning, this work is very troublesome, and also I am very sleepy in morning. Perhaps, my father sleepy too. So, my father said the day before yesterday, ""When you become 13 years old, you must wash your hair yourself everyday."" So this morning, I washed my hair myself. I thought it was very annoying. 

My family went to my grandmother's house at 8:15 am. I think many families go to their hometowns that are far away. But my grandmother, my grandfather, and my great-grandmother live only 10 minutes away from my house by car. 

At my grandmother's house, I waited for my uncle, my aunt, and my cousin. My cousin is Hyeon-ji Ahn. (I introduced her when I wrotein my introduction, ""About Me."") We performed a New Year's bow. So, I received some money from my relatives. Yeah~~~ 

We don't hold a memorial service to honor my ancestors because our family is a Christianity family. So we prayed before eating breakfast. The food is very delicious because my grandmother was a cook. But I felt bloated, so I couldn't eat a lot of food. But while everyone was eating, I watched Hyeon-ji. She is very cute! She is good, and she obeys her parents and grandparents. She is only 2 years old, but she is very smart. And she obeys me, too!!! I thought, she is nicer and cuter than my sister Ha-yeon. 

My parents, uncle and aunt said when I was playing with Hyeon-ji; ""We going to the church. Please stay here with your sister."" Why didn't Ha-yeon and I go to the church with them? Because, they went to the church at 10:30am. But, we already went to church at 9:00am. So, we watched TV. The adults came back to grandmother's house when the drama finished. 

And we went to a place to meet my father's grandmother on his mother's side. I met another great-grandmother, my uncle, and my aunt. My uncle is 13. He and I are of the same age. And my aunt is one year older than me. So I must call them uncle and aunt. Oh, my, GOD!!!!! This is a very funny phenomenon, isn't it? 

Today, I will go to the 6th grade. So I will behave like a grown-up. This weekend, I will finish the fifth grade. 2013! I'll make it the best year among my life. Well, I will make the effort to make it the best year of my life.

This musical was very important because the Korean government would give money to them. But he had mixed blood, so he looked like a Filipino.

"809&Dear Little Fox reader, 

Hey, guys. Nice to see you again. Have you ever heard about an event for some people who like animations? <TR>Well,</TR> last Saturday, I went to an even called ""Seoul Comic World"". <EV>That is an event for people who like animations very much.</EV> My friend, Neko, my mother, and I went there. If you want to know more information about this event, you can search for it on the internet. 
<TR>Well,</TR maybe I can tell you some information. As you might have read at the top of the letter, the definition for Seoul Comic World is an event for some people who like animations. There were many things there like bag, badge, pencil case, ball point, poster, card, glasses cleaner and many books. It was held for one or two months during the weekend. <TR>Well,</TR> let me tell you about our schedule.
<tr>Actually,</tr> we planned it a few month ago after my brother, Evan went to this last October. <TR>And,</TR> he said it had many people there. <TR>Well,</TR> he bought some novels because I required him to buy some types of novel I like. <TR>So,</TR> I really wanted to go there and I started to plan when we will go. 
<TR>At first,</TR> I wrote an advertisement on my personal blog. I thought I would go there with some of my friends, but my mom only allowed me to go with one friend. <TR>So I chose Neko. She wrote back to me first. <TR>And</TR> my other friends, named ""Lemon Tea"" and ""Farewell"" , ""Blue Sky"" were all also going to go there on December 24. She also bought some novel. <TR>And als,</TR> my blog neighbor gave me a card. 
<TR>Because of this,</TR> Neko and I are going to the Seoul with my mom. <TR>Before,</TR> I tell you a story, I want to remind you that I live in the country. I didn't go to Seoul many times, <TR>so</TR> I wasn't used to Seoul's street or underground railway. I didn't know how I was supposed to get to the Hac-YuWul station. 
<TR>Now,</TR> let me tell you about our schedule. A few days ago before we went to the Seoul, Neko and I talked a lot in Kakao Talk. Sometimes I asked Lemon Tea questions. <TR>On that day,</TR> I woke up at 5: 30. I hurried to dress up and eat some kimbap. When I came to the bus station, Neko had already arrived. We bought our tickets and my mom didn't help!! She said she is like the air!! <TR>However,</TR> we started to go to the Central city bus/ underground railways' station. That time was very early. So my mom was sleeping. Neko and I talked the whole time. Sometimes I asked someone if they knew how to get to the Seoul trade Exhibition Convention(SETEC). 
<TR>Well,</TR> the Central City station is very huge!! Although we reached it before 8 am, there was a huge amount of people. I think we waited almost 2 hours. And the line was very long. Before we waited, Neko and I watched people preparing their things. At 10 o clock, we were admitted. 
The people were all crowded. I bought many books, card, pen and also post-it and a pencil case. Maybe around 1pm, we ate some lunch and went back home. <TR>At the back of bus,</TR> I read a novel I bought, and Neko went to sleep. It was a such a great trip. <CO><TR>Sometime,</TR> if I have any time, I will go there again later. Bye!!</CO>

"810&Dear, Little Fox readers,

Hi, it's nice to meet you again. <EV><TR>Now,</TR> I'm very sad about my school.</EV> <TR>So,</TR> I'm very sorry that today's letter might be shorter than ever. <TR>Well,</TR> what is the problem? Our school will have graduation this week. And we (I mean the students who were born in 2000) are the 101st class. That means, our school's age is 101 years! <TR>In fact,</TR> almost all of my family member on my mother's side graduated from this school. Not only my mother, but also my uncle, aunt, grandfather, and even his father all graduated from this school. <TR/>By the way,</TR> my school is Seosan Elementary School. I think I talked about this already. 
This school has given me a lot of memories, especially in the last few years. Although my classmates and I weren't that close, (my favorite friends are all in another class) the teacher is very kind, and my classmates were very good! I even thought my class was the best class among the whole 6th grade.
Let me tell you some of my little memories from the 6th grade.
/<TR>At first,</TR> maybe around the 2nd or 3rd of March, my last year of elementary school began. <TR>At first,</TR> I didn't like the third class because for the last 4 years, I've always been in the 3rd class. 3-3, 4-3, 5-3 and now 6-3? Because of this, I didn't like this class, at first. <TR>Also,</TR> all of my favorite friends were in other classes, and there were so many new students that I was very afraid. But when the teacher came in, I thought she was very pretty. In fact, she is actually really pretty.
Some weeks later, the school clubs came to our class and advertised. <TR>Fortunately,</TR> I heard the school band wanted new members, only from the 6th grade. When I was in 5th grade, I saw the band's performance at the school festival. <TR>And</TR> it looked great. <TR>After that day,</TR> I thought being in the school band would be great.<TR> Now,</TR> I finally had a chance. <TR>At first,</TR> when I joined the school band, I wanted to play the guitar or drums. <TR>But</TR> during that term, I learned to play the acoustic guitar. I knew how to play the guitar and I also liked the drums. <TR>But</TR> my foot would hurt when playing the drums. <TR>So,</TR> I chose to play the bass guitar. The teacher said that they only needed one bass guitar, so I really wanted to be the one to play. The competition was very crowded. When I learn to play the bass guitar, I feel very happy. Every morning, the students in the 6th grade are always looking at us.
Than we went to the school picnic to Gyeong Ju. We stayed up talking at night, until 2:00 am. Sometimes my teacher would come and talk with us. <TR>Also at night,</TR> we would drawing something with marker on one of my friends. That was really fun. Because that time was in the spring, I could take a picture of a beautiful flower!
The time passed. In June, a few of my friends and I went to Spa-Castle in Ducksan. We had a really fun time playing. <TR>Also,</TR> we slept at night and had a sleepover.
<TR>During the second term,</TR> our school had many festivals. Also our band was able to go to a children's talent contest. <TR>Well,</TR> we didn't actually end up winning. And there was also an English festival. In the English festival, our band played two songs and people liked it. 
<TR>Now,</TR> I'm graduated now. One of my friends named Pudding is going to go to art middle school. I really want to make good memories with her before she goes to that school.
<CO>Today's letter is finished. Have a nice week, dear readers.</CO>

Dear Little Fox readers,

Another week has passed. <EV><TR>But this week,</TR> many things have changed, like my graduation, Valentine's Day, and New Year's Day!</EV> Today's subject is New Year's Day. Let's talk about Valentine's Day and my graduation later. I think the next subject will be about those two things.
On New Year's Day, many people go places like their parents' house or cousin's house. Where did you go this holiday? The city? The country? I went to Gyeong gi do. <TR>Actually,</TR> during every holiday I go to my grandmother's house, which located in the country, in Gumsan goon. That's right. They are famous for ginseng. It's a plant. And people think ginseng is very good for your body. 
Like at my grandmother's house, some parts of Gumsan goon grow ginseng. The nature in that village is very nice. <TR>In summer,</TR> I can see crawfish, marsh snails, and a few other things. Those animals are hard to see anywhere, so that means there is much fresh water that crawfish can live in.
This winter is too cold, isn't it? Because of heavy snow, strong winds, and low temperatures, my grandmother's house's water was frozen. Even though we need water, we can't use any! <TR>But</TR> my parents won't go to my uncle's house.
<TR>Actually,</TR> I'm not close with my uncle's family. Those cousins are too busy. The older sister is 22. She's always out working. And the older brother is now 19. Because he will have a big test this year, he is always busy too. The youngest is 14. He and I are the same age. I think he is the closest to me.
<TR>However,</TR> on February 9th, I went with my brother Evan and my mom to my uncle's house by bus and underground subway. Before we got on the bus, my mom bought us some hamburgers. They were delicious.
There was nothing for me to do but use my cell phone. So me and Evan used our cell phones. But not the whole time. <TR>For someof the time,</TR> we were talking to each other. It took a long time to reach my uncle's house.
Everything is the same at my uncle's house. <TR>First,</TR> we ate samgyetang. That is a dinner. Then, the adults watched television and the kids used their phones.
<TR>The next day,</TR> I woke up at around seven. We made sacrifices and bowed to our ancestors. Then we ate some food. <TR>Also,</TR> I bowed to my grandmother, my uncle, my aunt, and my parents. 
From 8 to 9 p.m., we went to see my other grandmother, my mom's mother, and bowed to her.
<CO><TR>Now,</TR> I need to solve a toeic problem. Have a nice week!</CO>

"812&<EV>[Nepal's living Goddess, 'Kumari']</EV>

Dear Little Fox readers,

Hey guys, it's Jinny again. <TR>A few days ago,</TR> I heard some unexpected news from my English academy. Do you believe in gods? Do you believe in Buddha or are you Hindu? <TR>Actually,</TR> I'm Christian. But that isn't a point. In a few cities in Nepal, such as its capital city, Katmandu, they have a living goddess named Royal Kumari or Kumari Devi.
Oh, let me introduce myself first. My name is Jinny and I'm 14 years old in 2013. My elementary school is Seosan Elementary School and my middle school will be Buchun Middle Schools. I didn't graduate from my elementary school yet. Next Wednesday is my graduation day. I think I might write about my graduation day next week. Let's talk about it later. I need to tell you lots of things about Kumari.
Kumari is a young girl. All Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal and India admire her. Kumari comes from an ancient story. An ancient goddess named Taleju came to the ground looking like a pretty young girl. <TR>One day,</TR> a Nepal king wanted to take her. <TR>Then,</TR> she was really angry so she went back to the sky. When the king regretted his mistake and begged for forgiveness, Taleju told to him to find a young pure girl to be her helper. She told him to admire her. This is the ancient story about Kumari. Because Kumari is a living goddess, she must have many qualifications. 
Kumari must have 32 perfect qualities. Not all the qualities are made public, but I knew about a few of them. Kumari can only be selected from young girls who are aged 2 to 4. She must have be from the family named Shaka (descendants of Sukgamony), and she can only live in Katmandu, which is Nepal's capital city. <TR>According to ancient text,</TR> Kumari musn't have any scars or blood. If Kumari bleeds, she can't be Kumari anymore. Kumari must have cow-like eyes, snail-like neck, tree-like body. <TR>Also,</TR> she must be calm and brave. Kumari should have 20 teeth. The final test is to have Kumari sleep in a place full of dead and bloody animals. When they finish all of the tests, there are no doubst that she is a Kumari.
When the girls are living as Kumari, her rank is even higher than the rank of kings. I told you, dear readers, all of the Hindus and Buddhists admire her. Kumari lives in a palace. She lives in luxury while she is the Kumari. 
Although Kumari are rich and do not do anything, some people point out Kumari could be like child-abuse, so they want to figure out the facts. <TR>Because of this,</TR> Nepal court investigates about Kumari's abuse.
<TR>In fact,</TR> Kumari lives a very lonely life in her own palace. The government thinks that humans can't teach a goddess, so a few years ago, none of the people taught Kumari. <TR>And</TR> she couldn't go out by herself. Her mother and father would carry her during festivals. <TR>Outside,</TR> Kumari shouldn't stand by herself. Kumari has to sit down in a golden chair and watch people pray to her. They only look outside during the festival times. <TR>At this time,</TR> people think when they see her, it brings them good luck. <TR>And</TR> the worst part is no one cares about the retired Kumari. When she retires, there are superstitions, which is when Kumari comes back to her family's home, she brings bad luck to her family. <TR>Also,</TR> when a former Kumari gets married, it also bring them bad luck. <TR>So</TR> a few decades ago, Kumari often had to live in a slum for the rest of her life. <TR>But fortunately, now,</TR> people don't believe that anymore. 
<TR>Now</TR> I'm going to explain some traditions about the Kumari. When people kiss on her feet, she gives them a blessing. Blessing means a lot of gold for them. <TR>Also,</TR> they give her a payment, too.
<TR>Well,</TR> I need to do other homework. <CO>Have a nice New Years Day!!</CO>

"813&Dear Little Fox Reader,

Guess what! <EV>My father bought a new television.</EV> <TR>Actually,</TR> we used our last TV for more than 15 years. <TR>So,</TR> my father thought it was time to buy a new one. <TR>And</TR> the government announced that it will only support Analog TV to December 31st, 2012. <So</TR> last week, the delivery finally arrived. And we have a new television. <TR>Now, behind me,</TR> my family is watching television in 3D. Maybe I will join them after I finish this letter, dear readers.
<TR>Before I tell you,</TR> let me introduce myself. I'm Jinny and in 2013, I turned 14 years old. <TR>Now,</TR> my school, Seosan elementary school has winter vacation. <TR>And next week,</TR> maybe I will go to school to prepare for the class assignment examinations. I don't like that because now, I still don't know which school I will go to late this year. In fact, I don't want to graduate elementary school. But let's talk about this later. Today's subject is about my family's new 3D television and my pretty new tablet. 
<TR>Well,</TR> everything started a few, maybe two, weeks ago. <TR>At that time,</TR> my dad told us that he will buy a new television. <TR>In fact,</TR> I had already seen it at the market. <TR>But</TR> I never thought about buying the television. <TR>But</TR> the TV is really good. It's very huge. <TR>Now,</TR> I like to watch 3D advertisements everyday. I feel great!! Our television is made by the company Samsung. Mother told me that LG is better than Samsung, so I'm wondering why dad bought a new TV at Samsung's store. <TR>Maybe</TR> I can figure that out next time. <TR>But</TR> I don't need to complain. The store gave us a free mouse and keyboard. 
I need to watch a movie in 3D, but I didn't try it yet. <TR>Unfortunately,</TR> our set-up box wasn't from the same company as the television. But I hope it can support the 3D set-up box.
The next subject is about my tablet. <TR>Well,</TR> it doesn't have the same definition as the word in English. A tablet is a machine to draw a picture more easily. A few of my friends have one. There are many companies that are making tablets better and better. <TR>But</TR> I think the functions don't always guarantee drawing. <TR>In my case,</TR> I already told you that my friends have tablets, right? One of those friends draw very well. She is even going to an art middle school in March. She is the best artist among all of the students in our grade at school. When I asked what tablet I should buy, she said her tablet was really cheep. The functions weren't as important. I thought I should care more about the user's ability to make a nice drawing. 
My tablet's name is the Lapaz PF 8060. It's one of the cheapest tablet, actually. <TR>My friend,</TR> whose nickname is Hyun, told to me that the best tablet is the Wacom Bamboo model. <TR>Also,</TR> that is the one she uses. I already knew that the Wacom company's tables aregood, but they are too small and too expensive. The smallest one is more expensive than the Lapaz tablet. <TR>Well,</TR> they are less expensive than the Lapaz tablet called Biss but people said that it was bad quality. And I don't have that much money. <TR>In fact,</TR> I didn't get money from New Year's day. <TR>Actually,</TR> it hasn't been New Years day yet. 
<TR>Because of this,</TR> I used some of the money that I gathered over the past few years. The Lapaz tablet cost 60000 won. I wanted to buy other objects to use for drawing characters, but I couldn't. Maybe I'll buy those things at a later time. They are not expensive at all. 
<TR>However,</TR> I still have to wait a few mre days. Maybe on Thursday, the parcel service will give me a shiny new tablet. When searching on the internet, customers can choose two different colors, black or white. <TR>But</TR> I didn't mind it. I think white is better than black for drawing pictures. <TR>But</TR> in normal cases, I like black better.
<TR>Because</TR> the box wasn't easy to open, I used a knife. I told the parcel service supervisor to wrap it tightly. <CO>That is the reason it was so hard to open. But it looks pretty shiny and nice. I'll use it later. Have a nice day, readers.</CO>

"814&Dear, Little Fox reader,
Hi, it's me again dear reader. <EV><SR>I want to continue my story about the daily life at the chosen mentoring camp.</SR></EV> Did I already talk to you about new years day? <TR>Well,</TR> let's start.
<TR>Before I tell you,</TR> let me introduce myself. I'm Jinny and in 2013, I am 14 years old. <TR>Now,</TR> my school, Seosan elementary school had winter vacation. <TR>So now,</TR> I'm writing and working on a novel. But let's talk about my novel later.
<TR>At first,</TR> this story is about what happened on January 2nd. <TR>On that day,</TR> we went to Lotte World. <TR>But before we went there,</TR> we needed to spent time mentoring because the silly camp reserved the tickets for the afternoon. I wanted to get there as fast as I could, but my teacher told us that there wouldn't be a picnic anymore. So we planned to eat many snacks. Like potato, squid with butter, coke, and a few of other things. <TR>After mentoring,</TR> we went to eat lunch. We used forks at lunch. <TR>Well,</TR> never mind. <TR>Then,</TR> we started to go to Lotte World. One and a half hours later, we arrived. 
<TR>At 3 o'clock,</TR> we walked through the entrance. Since the last time I visited Lotte World was when I was 9 years old, I didn't remember many things about it from that day. <TR>However,</TR> my dear roommates were richer than I thought. They told me that they will go to Lotte World after the camp is finished. And they already knew about many of the rides at Lotte World. <TR>In my case,</TR> my family didn't go to amusement parks often.
When I went there, first, we drank coke at the Lotteria. I really wanted to eat or drink something, so I liked that very much. <TR>Then,</TR> my mentoring teacher suggested to us that she wants to rest so that we could play by ourselves. <TR>And</TR> we said yes. We went to ride a bike and I teased my friend Yu-Mi-Hyang that I came to Lotte World. My roommates and I went bike riding. Although we went around the U-shape while biking, I sat the end of the bike. It was scary, but also fun. <TR>After that,</TR> we were waiting for a riding named French Revolution. They told me French Revolution spins 360˚. <TR>Because of that,</TR> we had to wait for 2 hours. While we were waiting, I ate a peanut butter squid. It was very delicious. I still want to eat it again. <TR>After</TR> I went on the ride, I ate a tornado potato. <TR>But</TR> I liked the squid better. I wanted to ride the Giant Hoop, but we needed to search for our teacher first. We rode Turing Basket with my teacher. She was talking about the mentoring camp. It was very funny. Then we ate pork cutlet. <TR>Because</TR> I ate lots of snacks, I didn't eat much. We still had a lot of time so we bought hairbands. I bought a small blue-spotted hairband. We ride more bikes than we came back to our lodging.
<TR>The next day,</TR> we had to have a mock assembly at the evening and night. I was chosen to represent the party. Our party's name was the Grape Party. We had so much fun with it. There were four topics including Korean folk tales (Shim Chung), talent's privacy, and internet real-name financial transaction system. There was also one more subject but I can't remember!
<TR>On Thursday,</TR> we cheered for each university: Korea University vs. Yonsei University. Because our mentoring teacher was a Korea University student, my roommates and I cheered for that university. Like Seoul University and Kaist, it is one of the best universities. <TR>But,</TR> I think winning and losing is not that important. <TR>All of the guys,</TR> even the teachers, were laughing and playing cheerfully.
<TR>On the last day,</TR> we had a good-bye party. Well, at the end when we were hugging our teacher, I cried softly. We all wrote letters to our teacher. When it was time to confess, we teased the camp because we all disliked it. When it was finished, we had a cake and all of my roommates and a few of the teachers played with each other. 
<TR>The next day,</TR> I went back home. <CO>This is the end. I need to send message to my teacher, so I need to say good-bye to you dear readers. Have fun!</CO>

For the people meeting me for the first time, just remember that I'm Jinny and I go to Seosan elementary school. <TR>Also,</TR> ten days ago, I turned 14 years old. <TR>But formally,</TR> I'm still in the 6th grade in elementary school because our new school's semester starts on March 2nd. 
Back to our subject guys. <TR>On December 30th,</TR> Sunday (that was the day of my brother's birthday), I woke up at 5:30 am. Seosan's first bus leaves at 6:30. <TR>So</TR> I hurried to bring my suitcase and get to the bus. <TR>Because</TR> I was very tired that day (I slept at 12:30 the night before so I only slept for five and a half hours.), I slept on the bus. When I opened my eyes, I was at the Seoul bus station. My dad bought some bread for me and that was my breakfast. Then I boarded the bus and met a friend named Kim Han Bee. <TR>At first,</TR> I was very worried that she wouldn't like me. <TR>But</TR> that wasn't true. I think she likes me. We became friends.
<TR>After</TR> we ate lunch in the building, it was time to separate the students so they could meet their mentors. <TR>Unfortunately,</TR> Han-Bee and I weren't on same team.<TR> But</TR> I met a very kind teacher named Jang-Jin. She is at Korea University. <TR>And also,</TR> she is an English Language and Literature major. I like her very much.
<TR>And</TR> I want to tell you about my roommate too. <TR>At first,</TR> I wanted to play with those girls. <TR>But</TR> just a few days later, I didn't like those girls. They are naughty, selfish, and tried to harm other people. <TR>As you know,</TR> I like to writing novels, right? Like many other writers, I don't want other people to look at my novel. <TR>But</TR> I told you that these girls are very selfish. <TR>After</TR> I wouldn't give them my note, when I took a shower, they saw my notebook. <TR>Also,</TR> they used my expensive pen even though I didn't allow them to use that pen. This is just one of the reasons that I don't like them. <TR>Still,</TR> there are many other reasons that I don't like them, but let's skip that part.
<TR>The second day,</TR> I met other girls who practiced with me in the mentoring program. I can't remember all of the girls' names because there were five girls. <TR>And</TR> one of the girls hated my roommate just like me! We talked about how my roommates are noisy. <TR>In fact,</TR> I'm very ashamed that I had to be in the same room with those girls. 
The third day was New Year's day. <TR>Well,</TR> in that camp, there was no significance. <TR>Well,</TR> the meal was actually worse. Every meal had too much oil and the sauce was the worst.

<CO><TR>Well,</TR> this is only part one of this entry. I'll tell you about the other days in the next part. Happy New Years, guys!</CO>

"816&Dear Little Fox Reader,

Nice winter, isn't it? <TR>Well,</TR> three days ago, it was Christmas! <EV><TR>Today,</TR> I'll tell you about the origin of Christmas and why Christmas is sometimes called X-mas.</EV> <TR>Also,</TR> I'll tell you about some famous Christmas books too.
Ummm... Shall I introduce myself? I believe you already know about me, like I'm 13 years and I live in Seosan, I'm in band class, I'm in 3rd class and etc... <TR>So,</TR> maybe I can skip this part today. I'm sorry if this is your first time meeting me, but we have still more things that I will introduce.
The first thing I would like to talk about is the origin of Christmas. It happened more than 2000 years ago. A holy woman named Mary, saw an angel came down from sky. The angel's name was Gabriel. He said to Mary that she will give birth to a baby. The baby was the son of God. <TR>And</TR> he also told Mary that she should called the baby, Jesus. On the other hand, the king had a dream at the same time. God told him that a baby aged 1 to 3 will be a king. Then the king was angry. He commanded his soldiers to kill all boys between the ages of 1 to 3. <TR>So,</TR> Mary and her fiance, Joseph had to run away. <TR>And</TR> Mary gave birth to Jesus in a little stable. <TR>At the same time,</TR> three wise men in the East saw a big star in the sky. They knew that their king was just born. So they hurried to the stable with special presents, which were gold, myrrh, and frankincense. <TR>And</TR> the year that Jesus born is A.D (Anno Domini). <TR>Also,</TR> Jesus born on December 25. This is the origin of Christmas!
<TR>Well,</TR> now I will change our subject to talk about why Christmas is sometimes called X-mas. Read carefully, dear readers. <TR>Before I tell you about this,</TR> I suggest that you shouldn't use X-mas if you are not Christian. Keep this in mind. Now, LET'S START!
<TR>So</TR> how did Christmas change to X-mas? What does it mean? It is because of the Greek language. X means Christ. <TR>And</TR> mas is mass. <TR>So,</TR> X-mas is same meaning of Christmas. I told you that you should keep in a mind that non-Christian people should not use this word, right? It's because of the X's meaning. <TR>In fact,</TR> X means 10 dollars, unknown quantity, sign that the people who don't know word, a kiss sign in letter.
Last one is a book about Christmas. I think everyone knows the story, The Christmas Carol. 
I'm sorry that today I have a very short letter. <CO><TR>But,</TR> I need to sleep now. Happy Winter, and Happy New Year, dear reader!</CO>

"817&Hello. It's me, Jinny. I told you about today's title, right? <TR>But,</TR> I hope you remember me first. <TR>Well</TR>... before I write my letter to you about part two, I need to give a summary of the last letter, right? <EV>In my last letter, I introduced you to my band members, didn't I?</EV> <TR>Today,</TR> is part two of the letter. I will introduce you to the last members, including myself, and tell you about the Seo San Teuroteu contest. <TR>Because,</TR> there is a lot of information about my band, I might write a third part for this letter. <TR>In fact,</TR> I don't want to write you three letters about my band class, because still I have so many things to tell you about my story. We don't have enough time, but we have so many things to do. <TR>Well,</TR> shall I start to tell you about my story?
<TR>So,</TR> let me introduce myself again. Whoever remembers me can skip this part. I'm Jinny. If someone is meeting me for the first, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" <TR>But</TR> let's hope everyone who is reading this letter already knows who I am. 
Last time, did I introduce Kim-Mi-Jung? If I did not, I will introduce her first.
Her name is Kim-Mi-Jung. She plays the guitar. She started to learn how to play the guitar since last year. <TR>Well,</TR> Neko said that because Mi-Jung didn't practice as much as she did, she is in the same class with me. She is very small and very light. She plays the electric guitar. Last year, when Mi-Jung performed at an English festival, she sat down in a chair because she is very small.
The next people I want to talk about are the drummers. We have two drummers. <TR>At first,</TR> we had three drummers, two boys and one girl. <TR>But</TR> we practiced only two songs, also, there were no empty seats where he could play. Never mind. <TR>Now,</TR> I will tell you guys about Na-ri.
<TR>Well...</TR> she has two nicknames. One is Forsythia. Forsythia's Korean name is Ge-Na-ri. She doesn't like this nickname. That is because her name is Na-ri. She doesn't like this nickname! <TR>However,</TR> her other name is farewell (작별). She made it herself. Never mind. Let's talk about her sound. Her drumming is brilliant. I really like the music she plays. <TR>Now,</TR> she likes to study bass. <TR>In fact,</TR> we help each other to make better sound and music. She is a pretty good teacher. <TR>Now,</TR> I can play the basic meter on the drums. I think she is almost ready to master one song already. 
There is also a small boy who plays the drum. He is small, a little fat and has a lot of energy inside. His drum sound is energetic and powerful. I like his sound, too. I think his family has many relatives who play the drums. <TR>In fact,</TR> his brother played the drums last year, too. 
Our band teacher always says that the boy needs to control his power. Never mind about that. His name is Jung-Gang. His nickname is Gang-Jung, of course. 
Umm... umm... you are almost done. <TR>Now </TR>it is the basses' turn. <TR>First,</TR> I will introduce the other member named, Kim Hae Min. She is really good. <TR>But</TR> our teacher said she can't keep the beat. <TR>And,</TR> she says she can see a ghost.
The last member is me, Jinny. <TR>As you know,</TR> I'm play not only the bass guitar but also the keyboard.
<TR>But</TR> you know me now, so I don't need to introduce myself once again. 
<CO>Today's letter was so boring, right? <TR>Next week,</TR> I will write you a letter about my teuroteu contest. I promise. <Tr>So, for today</TR>, I wantto say bye! </CO>

"818&Dear, Little Fox readers,

Guess what! <EV><TR>For the past few days,</TR> our city, Seosan, has had snow! I'm very happy about it.</EV> <TR>Because of the snow,</TR> I got a new pair of boots from my parents. <TR>Well,</TR> my running shoes are just for spring to fall. <TR>And,</TR> there are small hole on the shoes. <TR>So,</TR> when I wore them in the winter, my toes were getting very cold. However, I like my boots.
<TR>Well,</TR> let me introduce myself again. <TR>And</TR> I want to say sorry to you guys. I want to tell you more stories about me, like about my band or school, but I don't have enough time to write to you. <TR>Like today,</TR> I had a test. It was in Chong-Chung Namdo and all of the students from ages 9 to 13 took the test on the same day at the same time. What do you think about tests? Do you like tests? How do I feel about them? I don't like tests that much. Umm... let's talk about it later. It's not a good subject to talk about in the beginning of winter.
Back to the our first subject, okay? <TR>Three days ago,</TR> the weather forecast sent the news to us that it would snow. Like most ordinary children, my friends and I were very happy to see a lot of snow. <TR>And surprisingly,</TR> my class teacher allowed us to play in the playground.<TR> Then,</TR> the snowball fight began! There were a few piles of snow on the ground. Some of the boys wrote their names on the snowy ground. Since I didn't wear gloves, I trampled on the written names. <TR>Also,</TR> I threw snowballs at my friend. She didn't like it. <TR>However,</TR> she threw a snowball at me, so it was ok.
Maybe it was Wednesday, if my memory is working correctly. Although I had math academy, I couldn't go there because of the snow! <TR>And</TR> on Thursday, I went to my English academy. <TR>That day,</TR> there was too much snow everywhere. </TR>So</TR> I had a snowball fight with my brother, Evan. Evan think he is a good pitcher.<TR> Unfortunately,</TR> I don't agree with him. <TR>In fact,</TR> he didn't strike me out at all. <TR>Plus,</TR> the bus arrived at 6:25. <TR>And</TR> my English academy starts at 6:30. <TR>Well,</TR> surprisingly, in my class, there were only two students, my friend Diana and myself. <TR>That day,</TR> we had to make our own robot. <TR>After the class,</TR> Diana and I sang a song in the car. 
<TR>On the other hand,</TR> we were stuck because of snow. <TR>Actually</TR> our academy car must leave before 8:40. <TR>But that day,</TR> we started to leave at 8:50. It was because the snow was unexpected for the driver.
<TR>After I left the bus,</TR> I made a snowball to fight with Evan again. <TR>But that day,</TR> my mom and Evan had a fight with each other and my mom threw Evan's cellphone. <CO>Maybe I will have a snowball fight with Evan later. Have a nice winter!</CO>

"819&Hello. It's me, Jinny. I told you about today's title, right? <TR>But</TR> I hope you will remember me first since I haven't had enough time to write this letter to you. <EV>We had many festivals.</EV> <TR>After I write this,</TR> I will write you more letters. Please forgive me. But don't worry. I will write a letter once a week. 
<TR>So,</TR> let me introduce myself again. Whoever remembers me can skip this part. I'm Jinny. If someone is meeting me for the first, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" <TR>But</TR> let's hope everyone who is reading this letter already knows who I am. 
Today's title is about my school band. <TR>But</TR> there are is so much information about my school band. <TR>So,</TR> I suggest to you that I separate this letter into two part. <TR>After I write this letter,</TR> I will write part two. I will introduce our band in this letter.
<TR>At first,</TR> I will introduce you to my band's name. Our band's name is Hahaha (하하하) band. <TR>Well,</TR> almost everyone, except our band members, thinks that our name is just a laughing voice. <TR>In fact,</TR> that's not true. Well, it isn't that surprising at all, because at first, I thought that the name was just for a laugh. <TR>But a few weeks ago,</TR> I realized the name's meaning. May I use Korean to explain? Thank you.
Our band's meaning is (하라고 하라고 해서 하는 밴드). Isn't it funny? I asked my mom and she agreed with me. <TR>So,</TR> should I introduce our members? Ok, let me start.
We have nine people in the band: one vocal, two bass guitars, three electric guitars, two drums, and one electronic piano called a keyboard (the keyboard instrument). Oops, if you think that the number is equal to ten, it's because I play both the keyboard and bass guitar. 
<TR>First</TR> I will talk about our vocal. We have one vocal. Her name is Lee Jee-Hae. She has a nice voice. <TR>But unfortunately,</TR> she can't sing very high notes. <TR>So</TR> she always has trouble with that. Never mind. I think she is a great singer!
Next is the electric guitar. There are three... no, there are four people. <TR>At first,</TR> there were only three people. <TR>But two month ago,<./TR> my friend brought this guy and said, ""He wants to play the guitar, too."" <TR>Well,</TR> he doesn't speak on his own. He just says, ""Boo"" all the time. His name is Wo Jae-Jin. <TR>Although</TR> he has been in the band for only two months, he does very well. I need to tell you about the other band members, and there are 7 left. <TR>So</TR> I will try to hurry. I don't have enough time.
The next guitar member is Kim En-Jee. Her nickname on the internet is Neko. Neko means cat in Japanese. She is one of the oldest people in our band. She has been playing the guitar since 2011, which was when she was 12 years-old. Neko and I play the same songs. I think our band's leader is Neko. That means I think that she has the most power in the band. 
<TR>Next</TR> is Pudding. That is her nickname. Her real name is Choi So-Hyun. She is my best friend. Her dream is to be an illustrator. <TR>In fact,</TR> she draws the prettiest characters I ever saw. She plays a song called ""Balloons.""
I spent so much time talking about all of my band members. <CO><TR>In part two of my letter,</TR> I will introduce them to you. Bye and see you later.</CO>

"820&Dear Little Fox Reader,

Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you again, dear reader. Do you remember me?　It's me, Jinny. <EV><TR>Well,</TR> let me introduce myself quickly.</EV> Whoever remembers me can skip this part. I'm Jinny. If someone is meeting me for the first, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" <TR>But</TR> let's hope everyone who is reading this letter already knows who I am. 
Guess what! <TR>At our academy,</TR> we had a great time today! <TR>Before</TR> I start to tell you about it, may I ask you about something? If you're ok with that, let me ask the question first. <TR>In America,</TR> what do people do on October 31st? Well, the hint is ""Trick Or Treat"". That's right. You're clever! It's Halloween! Halloween has many symbols that everyone knows about like candy, Jack-o-lanterns, pumpkins, trick-or-treating, costumes, ghosts, monsters, witches, broomsticks, mummies, etc. How many symbols can you find for Halloween? <TR>Personally,</TR> I can find more than ten.
Halloween is my favorite holiday. It's not because of the symbols.<TR> In fact,</TR> the symbols are great. <TR>But</TR> for Halloween, our English academy prepared to have a Halloween party. <TR>During this term,</TR> we collected coupons. The coupons helped us to buy items for our Halloween party.
<TR>Well,</TR> shall I explain to you about my Halloween party? Thank you! 
Our Han-Young academy has a Halloween party once a year. We are celebrating Halloween on the last Friday of October. This year our Halloween party was on October 26th. <TR>Before</TR> the Halloween party, everyone in our academy was very busy, from the 1st grade to middle school students. <TR>In my case,</TR> my class' students were very busy because of Halloween. The teacher and our classmates made some pumpkin bags for little kids that are aged 8 to 9. We are making a lot of pumpkin bags for them. I think we were making more than 60 bags in one hour! 
<TR>Well,</TR> there was a reason for why we were making lots of pumpkin bags. Our class has 2 boys and 7 girls. <TR>For more details about thegirls,</TR> please read the letter about my birthday. Dylan made holes on the bag. Bill strung the thread through hole. I drew some pictures. Judy and Elena drew too. Diana and Bellah cut the paper. Rachel and Sophie stuck the paper on the bag. I drew many pictures. 
<TR>However,</TR> we had a Halloween party! I wanted to get there before 6. <TR>But</TR> my friend who goes to a math academy said they were going to their math academy first instead of going to our English academy first. <TR>So,</TR> I went to the math academy too! <TR>That day,</TR> it was very boring.
When I got to the English academy, the decorations were great. On the ceiling, there were spiders on spider webs. On the front door there was a mummy shaking it's hand. On the wall, there was a big Jack-o-lantern, witch, cat, etc. In the library, every desk was gone. The teacher wore a costume. Sandra was a cowgirl. Hera was a witch. Julie and Piggy didn't wear anything. I think Ethan was a ghost.
<TR>For Halloween,</TR> we collected special money called coupons. It was just paper. <TR>But on Halloween,</TR> the coupon was very valuable paper. We bought cookies, candies and other products too. I can't explain more, but it was very fun.
<CO>My next letter will be about my school band. See you later!</CO>

Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you again, Little Fox reader. I'm Jinny. <EV>If someone is meeting me for the first, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee.""</EV> <TR>But</TR> let's hope everyone who is reading this letter already knows who I am. 
I'm very sorry that I didn't write as many letters as you may have expected. <TR>But</TR> I hope you didn't forgot about me Little Fox reader. <TR>Then,</TR> shall we go back to the main story?
Today's letter might be very short. Unfortunately, my school has a test on October 23rd. It is a midterm exam. <TR>Actually,</TR> I'm very surprised because my school's test is very late. <TR>Well,</TR> Diana's school already finished their test 2 weeks ago. She said the test was easy. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> Bill, who goes to the same school as Diana, said the test was hard. <TR>As for me,</TR> I'm not at the same school as Diana, so I will take the test later. Two weeks before taking the test, my friend, Jin-Sook, and I went to the library to study. I think that I studied very hard, but that doesn't really matter. People will judge another person by his or her results.
<TR>During the fist week,</TR> I went to the library at 10:00 am exactly. Because on Friday afternoon, my friend told me, ""Jinny, we are going to meet at the library by 10. Do you understand?"" <TR>And</TR> of course I did! So I got there at 10. <TR>But</TR> now I know better, because she would actually come to the library around noon. I did my homework, read some books actually. <TR>Also,</TR> I studied for the test too.
When she came, we studied at the children's library. <TR>In fact,</TR> we didn't study at first. We read a book called ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians."" 30 minutes later, we started to study. Jin-sook and I solves the questions in the workbook.
(* An explanation about the library: The Seo-San library is separated by many smaller libraries, for children, adults, teenagers, etc. <TR>On the second floor,</TR> there is a quiet place, and a laboratory. <TR>On the first floor,</TR> there was are all sorts of libraries as I explained, and there is also a movie theater.) We wanted to study on 2nd floor but the middle school students didn't have their exams yet so we couldn't go there and study.
<TR>The next Saturday,</TR> I went to the library at 10:32 am and Jin-Sook said she would come there at 10. Our schedule to practice was the same. We often go to the back and study there. We studied there until 3. <TR>This time, </TR>the older people finished their midterm test. <TR>So,</TR> I went upstairs. I couldn't believe myself because I met Joo-Yeon in the library. She is a friend of mine but she doesn't want to practice her exam, especially at the library.
<TR>The day after Saturday, Sunday,</TR> was also the same. <TR>So,</TR> I don't have to tell you about that. That's okay isn't it? 
Tuesday was our test. I didn't do very well even though I studied very hard. Bye!

"822&Dear Little Fox Reader,

When was your field trip? And, where did you go? <EV><TR>Last Friday,</TR> I went to Everland on a field trip.</EV> Do you already know, ""To Everland, fantasy world""? <TR>Well,</TR> I had a few arguments with my dear friend, but I'll tell you about that later. It's not a good subject to talk about with you. Oh, I forget to introduce myself. It's a pleasure to meet you again. I'm Jinny. If someone is meeting me for the first time, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" <TR>But</TR> let's hope everyone who read this letter already knows who I am. 
<TR>Well, today,</TR> I will tell you about my field trip. <TR>Last Friday,</TR> on October 12th, our school went to Everland on a field trip.<TR> At first,</TR> my team and I rode on the first bus.
For young readers, I'll explain what Everland is. Everland is located in Young-in. It was made in 1976. It is very large. I even got lost in Everland! 
Our teacher said that the bus cost was much higher to get to Everland. So, our class was separated into three groups. There are four classes for the sixth grade. Someone said that it's because the school wanted to have fewer classes. <TR>But,</TR> it's actually because another school was built a few years ago. <TR>Also,</TR> Seosan primary school is in the middle of street. <TR>As a result,</TR>there is only a small number of students who go to our school. It's not my fault.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> I'm a member of the third class. My team and the boys team were riding on the first bus. One group of boys and one group of noisy girls were on the second bus. My dear friend, Joo-Yoen complained to me about this. She wanted me to go on her bus. In fact, I hoped that I would be able to go with her. <TR>But</TR> our team lost at the rock- scissors- paper game. <TR>Also,</TR> I wouldn't like to ride on that bus either. <TR>On that bus,</TR> there were some unfriendly faces. I wouldn't like to be face to face with any of the naughty girls.
I will get back to my original story now. We left to go to Everland at 7 o'clock in the morning. Since we were leaving so early,I had to wake up at 6. <TR>Then,</TR> I ate kimbob. <TR>Next,</TR> I went to school. Blah, blah, blah. The teacher talked to us about something. <TR>But</TR> I can't remember. She might have said that we must be careful in Everland. <TR>But</TR> that wasn't that important. The most important thing was, we were riding a bus, right?
After we arrived at the front gate, I was very surprised. <TR>At that time,</TR> there were many people and it was very crowded. <TR>Well,</TR> we waited an 1 hour before we could get in! Th My friend murmured to me that people should want to rest on the weekends. I agree with her opinion. <TR>However,</TR> we were finally able to go inside. Our team is made up of both boys and girls. There were four boys and two girls. 
<TR>In fact,</TR> my own plan was to visit the Horror Maze, which is only held in September and October. <TR>But unfortunately,</TR> I am only thirteen years old. That ghost house only allows people who are at least fifteen years old. When I searched the internet, everyone who experienced the ghost house said that it was really scary. I might go there a few years later.
<TR>At first,</TR> we were waiting to go on a ride called Hurricane. It swings around like going down a big slide. <TR>But</TR> the difference is that it also spins around. My teammate said it looked very scary, but I told them that it wasn't very scary. <TR>One of my friends,</TR> Mi Jung, said it was very fun after we went on the ride. <TR>But the other hand,</TR> I don't think the boys enjoyed it as much as we did. <TR>Then,</TR> it was 11 am. One boy, named An-Dae Hyun said to me he wanted to get a Q-PAss for the T-Express. <TR>But</TR> when we reached for it, the Q-pass was done. <TR>Because of this,</TR> we ate something instead. It was noon.
<TR>After we finished eating our lunch,</TR> we walked and walked. I thought that we were very unlucky. The parade was about to start. We couldn't get through. <TR>So</TR> An-Dae-Hyun suggested that we ride the lift. The park was very crowded because as I had mentioned before there were many people. <TR>So</TR> we had to go in two separate lifts.
When we arrived at the other ride called the Rolling X Train, we couldn't find out other teammates. So we just went on the ride. 
<TR>Well,</TR> I actually thought it wasn't that great. <CO>Maybe you want to tell me to sop complaining, but I hope that you loved reading this letter. Bye.</CO>

If someone is meeting me for the first, I want to say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" But let's hope everyone who read this letter already knows. 
<TR>Well,</TR> back to the topic. I'll tell you about my birthday plan. <TR>Well,</TR> I thought my classmates at my academy and I might having a potluck party. A potluck party is when everyone brings some food and shares with everyone. I will buy some 콜팝 (col-pop) to bring. It might cost a lot of money. <TR>But,</TR> tomorrow is my birthday! <TR>Maybem</TR> I will buy them.
For the potluck party at the academy, my classmates decided what food they will buy. Me? I am buying col-pop. I'll tell you a little bit more about our class so that you can understand better. Our class is the top class. We have 9 students, 7 girls and 2 boys.
I'm a student at Seosan Elementary School. <TR>In fact,</TR> I'm the only child from my school who going to the academy. I have eyeglasses and my hair is always tied. My friend Diana said, ""If you un-tied your hair, I don't think I could recognize you, Jinny."" 
She has big eyeglasses. She is also one of the people in the Sesoan gifted program. It means that she is very good at English. <TR>As for me,</TR> I wanted to take the test for the gifted program, <TR>but unfortunately,</TR> I was visiting the Philippines at that time. I will now tell you about my friend Bella. She is very tall. She says she is over 165 cm. <TR>However,</TR> I thought her height was 160 cm. She has curly hair. <TR>Well,</TR> Bella doesn't wear eyeglasses. She is best friends with Diana. Her school is Seo Rim Primary Schooll. I can't say much about Bella.
Judy is the shortest person in our academy. She is the smartest friend I have ever met. Judy is always in first place. She is well-known for her vocabulary skills. She has freckles too. She goes to the same school as Bella and Dylan.
Elena has short, brown hair. Elena is very kind and she loves animals. I think her favorite animal is the hamster. She has freckles too. She dyed her hair. She is good at English. She goes to Buchun Primary School.
Rachel has curly, short hair. Her pronunciation is very good. She is best friends with Elena. She also goes to the Buchun Primary School too.
Sophie doesn't have bangs. <TR>Well,</TR> she goes to the Buchun Primary School too. She likes to play with Judy. She has two older sisters who are at the university.
<TR>Now </TR>Wit's time to introduce the boys.
Bill is one of the boys. <TR>Unfortunately,</TR> our class has only two boys. He is also a one of the smartest math academy students. The other is Diana.
Dylan is very tall. <TR>Well,</TR> he is at the same school as Bella. Bella says he is very good at studying, but I don't know why. He seems a little odd whenever I see him at the academy. 
<TR>Now,</TR> do you feel like you know more about my classmates at the academy? 
[Second Writing- 2012.10.10. 8:58]
Today is my birthday! <TR>In the morning,</TR> mom cooked a seaweed soup. <TR>Today,</TR> we will have a party for my birthday at the academy! <TR>So last night,</TR> mom bought col-pop. <TR>But unfortunately,</TR> not everyone at my school knew about my birthday! <TR>Well,</TR> even if they knew about it, I'm not sure if anything would have changed. Do you know 생일빵? Well, it's very hurtful. 
<TR>So,</TR> only a few of my friend knew about my birthday.
<TR>However,</TR> when I went to the English academy, everything changed.
<TR>First of all,</TR> I brought the col-pop. <TR>Second,</TR> Diana came with hot dogs. Elena brought fried potato chips. Rachel didn't come. Sophie got fish paste. I don't think many Americans have had a chance to eat fish paste. My American teachers, who are named Sandra and Ethan, told me that. Judy bough bread. Bill bought sour candy. Dylan had snacks. Bella gave us something to drink.
We ate a lot of things. <TR>As you know,</TR> Sandra, who is my teacher suggested that we play a game. <TR>After we finished,</TR> I went back to my house where my dad gave me fish. <CO>Today is the best day of my life.</CO>

"824&Dear Little Fox reader,

I'm so glad to see you again. It's me, Jinny. If someone is meeting me for first time, I will say, ""Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Jinny Lee."" <TR>But</TR> let's hope that everyone who read this letter, will already know me. <EV><TR>Well,</TR> back to the topic that I want to talk about today. I'll tell you about my weekend.</EV>
<TR>Last weekend,</TR> I went to my grandmother's house. <TR>Before</TR> I tell my story, should I ask you about something? Do you know when it was Thanksgiving in the United States? I'm sure you already know because you are smart. That's right. I knew you would know it. Thanksgiving is every 4th Thursday in November. They eat turkey for dinner. <TR>Well,</TR> in my case, I haven't had turkey before, so I can't tell you what it tastes like. <TR>But</TR> I'm sure it is delicious, isn't it?
<TR>Well,</TR> if you know about Thanksgiving is in the United States, it is very similar to Thanksgiving in Korea. It's called Chuseok! Chuseok is the one of the most well-known(famous) holidays in Korea. <TR>Therefore,</TR> the government designated the Chuseok holiday for 3 days. <TR>During this time,</TR> usually almost all Koreans go to visit their parents. <TR>In my case,</TR> I visited my grandmother who lives in the country. 
<TR>On the 29th of September,</TR> in the morning, my father and my brother, Evan, went to my grandma's house first. My mom and I left later because my mom had to work that day. <TR>If I went first,</TR> she would have had to ride the bus by herself. So, even though I couldn't make songpyeon, I went to my grandmother's house with my mom. <TR>On the other hand,</TR> I wanted to search the internet secretly. 
I could do whatever I wanted to before leaving, and my mom and I got to my grandma's house around 8 o'clock. <TR>At the bus stop,</TR> I wanted to eat Pringles but the the worker at the store said, there were none. In fact, the stores did have it. But I want to buy a little one. <TR>Luckily,</TR> at the other station, mom bought me some triangle-Kimbob and snacks. <TR>Also,</TR> I was sending text messages with my phone. I was texting with my friend. She is a very cheerful girl. She and I have the same sense of humor. <TR>For example,</TR> I send her a photo of the moon. Can you guess what she said? She texted me back saying, ""Jinny, the moon is so pretty. <TR>But</TR> I think a huge rabbit in the moon has visited the earth."" She is so funny!
<TR>However,</TR> when my mom and I arrived at my aunt's house, it was almost ten o'clock at night. <TR>Actually</TR> my father said to me that he would take us to my grandma's house. <TR>But</TR> he was already out because he had take one of my aunts to her house. (I have three aunts and one uncle.) <TR>So,</TR> my aunt, the wife of my father's older brother, came to take us to the house. And she told us about what my grandmother said to her. <TR>Well, </TR> it was just for my imagination because my mom didn't like what my aunt was saying. 
We went to the house. I said hello to grandmother. <TR>After</TR> watching a short TV show, I slept. The first day was over.
<TR>The next day,</TR> I woke up at half past six, because I needed to pray to my grandfather. It was boring and I wanted to sleep. <TR>Therefore,<TR> Evan and I were fighting. <TR>Well,</TR> we didn't hit each other. We just made a little noise. 
I visited my family's graveyard. I also helped my mom to make food. I helped to pick up the sesame leaves too. One of my cousins and I saw the rabbits gave them some food.<TR> After that,</TR> my family went back home again.
I like Chuseok, but I don't like all of the noise during Chuseok. It drove me crazy. <TR>Well,</TR> did you enjoy my letter this time? I hope you did. <TR>Well,</TR> see you later in my diary! Bye!

"825&Dear Little Fox reader, 

Hi. It is nice to meet you again. I hope you remember me because I haven't written in a while. There was nothing to talk about with you. Do you know what I mean? <EV>Every day is always boring and tiring.</EV> Everyday life is the same as usual. From house to school, from school to band, from band to academy, from academy to academy, and then finally go back home again. <TR>In fact,</TR> it was almost 8 pm when I usually come back to my home. I can't remember if I told you guys, what time I go out from my home. I didn't say, did I? <TR>Well,</TR> I almost leave from home at 8. I always come back at 8. It is most of the day. I study, study and study 12 hours. I know other middle or high school students study more, but I'm just an elementary school student! Although parents don't think it is much studying, my friends and I think it is. 
Ummm... I think it took too long to explain to you about such trivial things. <TR>Anyway,</TR> back to the first topic. Why did I write to you about my crazy daily life? 
<TR>But this morning, at noon,</TR> something happened! Something really great happened. Do you know, even elementary school students learn practical courses and listen to lectures? Whether or now you knew about it, I'll tell you more about it. Because ""Practical Course"" has a lot to do with today's entry. 
About a month ago, our teacher told our class that we will visit the livestock market. <TR>Also,</TR> he told us that the livestock market would be full of cats, chickens (hens and roosters), and small dogs. <TR>Also,</TR> I remember seeing geese at the livestock market too. It was crowded and look very cheerful. <TR>But on the other hand,</TR> there was also a lot of trash on the ground. <TR>In that moment,</TR> I thought people were so selfish. They said to animals that they are too cute. But when the teacher told us to pick up the garbage, they were saying that it was unfair. <TR>But</TR> everyone picked it up at last. We couldn't see the cows they were selling because they sell cows at dawn. <TR>By 6,</TR> the cows are gone. They smell the worst! 
People wanted to sell us a kitten. It was very cute so I wanted to buy it. <TR>In fact,</TR> the kitten cost only 2000won! Though I live in an apartment, I really wanted to raise the kitten. <TR>So</TR> I called to my mom to buy it. <TR>Well,</TR> as you know, mom doesn't have any sense! I couldn't buy it. We came back to school. 
<TR>After</TR> I came back in my house, I started to write this to you. <CO>It was good experience I thought. Bye and see you later!</CO>

"826&Dear Little Fox reader, 

Hi. Do you remember me? It's me, Jinny. Nice to see you again. My last letter was about the Louvre, wasn't it? <EV>It was about my trip.</EV> Today's subject will be a little different. It's about my hobby. Did you remember that I like drawing? If you do not, I'll tell you again about my hobbies. Although almost every girl at my age (teenagers) have some hobbies, I think I have so many hobbies. <TR>For example,</TR> I like drawing my own characters, writing some stories, and playing the bass guitar, or playing out side with my friends. <TR>But</TR> I'll tell you later about all of these things. <TR>However,</TR> one of my favorite hobbies is drawing. I have learned how to draw since I was in my first year of elementary school. That was 2007, I think. Now it is 2012. If you subtract 2007 from 2012, it is 5. <TR>Therefore,</TR> I have practiced drawing for 5 years! Sometimes people ask me, ""Is your dream to be an illustrator or something related to drawing?"" <TR>But</TR> it's just a hobby. I want to be an interpreter when I grow up.
But back to the original topic, I'll tell you about my drawing.
I have many friends I connect with because of drawing. <TR>At lunch time,</TR> we often talk about our drawing. But sometimes I also play basketball with them.
My favorite drawing friend is Hyun. It's not a real name actually. She is the best illustrator that I have ever met. She draws girls very well. She and her friend, who I am also friends with and is nicknamed Pudding, have illustrated a book. <TR>Well, actually,</TR> I first read it when I borrowed it from Hyun. <TR>But</TR> it is a very nice book about wanting to to be an illustrator like Hyun and Pudding. <TR>Luckily,</TR> October 10th is my birthday. I told my mom that I really liked that illustrator book. Fortunately, she bought these books for me. <TR>So now,</TR> on my desk, I have the whole series. <TR>Maybe</TR> I will let her borrow one of my books next Monday. It's the best book about illustration that I ever bought. The book taught me a lot of things like what is the best way to draw some characters, and how I can choose the best color for my own characters..
<TR>Also,</TR> it taught me how I can draw the backgrounds like a room, park, or street... Isn't that great? How about you?
I'm very sorry that this letter is so short, but I have nothing else to talk to you about. <CO>See you in my next letter. Have a nice day, Little Fox reader!</CO>

"827&Dear Little Fox reader, 

Hi, I'm Jinny. It's nice to meet you again in my English diary. <EV><TR>Every week,</TR> I'll write a letter to you about one of my fun stories.</EV> <TR>Before I tell you,</TR> I have a question for you. How much do you know about Greek mythology? In ancient Greece, people made these myths. People made gods and goddesses like Jupiter, Pluto, Diana and Athena. <TR>Also,</TR> the gods and goddesses had many stories that gave inspiration to artists to make works about Greek myths. Much of the art or sculptures can be found at the Louvre in Paris. You may wonder why I'm talking about Greek myths and the Louvre. It's because I want to tell you about my trip from last Sunday. - Sunday 3rd, September, 2012.- 
From June 5th to September 30th, I have some interesting thoughts about this trip. <TR>One day,</TR> I watched the Our World Landmarks series on Little Fox. <TR>At the time,</TR> my parents were sitting beside me. I thought my mom was very interested in learning more about the Musée du Louvre (The Louvre). She asked me to translate the story of Louvre. After my family heard the story, my mother wanted to do more research about the Musée du Louvre. <TR>In fact,</TR> I'm very interested in art. So I also searched everything. And I learned that this year, Louvre's art and statues of Greek mythology would be in Seoul. <TR>Well,</TR> it would be at the Seoul Art Center-Hangaram art museum. <TR>Actually,</TR> not just the Louvre exhibition but also other exhibitions such as university opera concerts and piano concerts. <TR>And</TR> I think I am very thankful to Little Fox to help me make one of my greatest memories with my family.
<TR>Now,</TR> I'll tell you about my trip. <TR>On the 3rd day of September,</TR> I woke up early. <TR>Well,</TR> not that early actually. Maybe around 7:30? <TR>However,</TR> my family and I, except my brother, ate breakfast and rode in my mom's car. Two hours later, we got there. 
I have personally never been to an art museum in Seoul. <TR>So</TR> this was the first time that I visited Seoul for looking at art. <TR>As you know,</TR> Seosan is not the as same as Seoul. The buildings are high, and the people are crowded everywhere on the streets. Even inside of a building, it's hard to find the exit. 
<TR>On the other hand,</TR> when we went up, I still liked that place because of its huge size. 
<TR>First,</TR> I visited a gift shop. There were many things that were related to Greek mythology like a picture of Zeus or Mercury. I bought small cards of pictures. The name are: ""The Fall of Phaeton,"" ""Pygmalion and Galateia,"" and ""Daphnis et Chloé."" I wanted to buy the notebook too, but it cost so much money! <TR>But fortunately,</TR> mom gave me the guide book that described the artwork in the museum. Inside of the museum, I was sad because I couldn't take any photos inside. <TR>And</TR> did you know this? I swear that one person took a photo of the artwork. It's against the rules in the museum. I don't like those kinds of people.
Inside of the museum, I saw a statue of Mercury. <TR>Also</TR> I saw amphora, an ancient Greek jar, and dishes that were really used a long time ago. I saw a tapestry that was also really used. I wanted to touch it but I couldn't. Touching it is the main reason that will cause a tapestry to crack. I admired the artwork and saw the little guidebook and told my parents about other Little Fox episodes I remembered such as Eros and Psyche or Zeus and Io. I had lots of fun that I went there. <CO>If I have another chance like this, I'll go again! 
See you next week, Little Fox reader!</CO>

"828&What did you when you were in elementary school? Did you have many fun times at your school? <EV><TR>Today,</TR> I'll tell you about my elementary school life.</EV> <TR>And</TR> I will also tell you about my favorite school memories too. 
I'm in the 6th grade at my school. <TR>Next year,</TR> I will graduate and I will be in middle school. <TR>Actually,</TR> I don't want to go there. In elementary school, there are many familiar faces. <TR>But</TR> when I go to middle school, I may be separated from my friends. <TR>In fact,</TR> I don't know which school I will go to yet.
Let me introduce my school. My school is in Seo-san Si. <TR>Last year,</TR> my school celebrated 100 years. <TR>Therefore,</TR> we had a party on my school ground. While we celebrated, we heard a very special guest was coming. Can you guess who it was? The hint is that she is the wife of our president. Her name is Lee-Hee-Ho. Now you know who is she? She is the wife of President Kim-Dea- Joung (김대중). My teacher told me she was 23rd graduate of my school. <TR>But now,</TR> she is very old and has no energy. <TR>However,</TR> I couldn't see her clearly because the students had to sit on the ground and our parents sat on the chairs. They covered the view. Everything except that was great. 
<TR>After that,</TR> I went to the Philippines, and I was in the 6th grade.
My classmates and teacher are great. Whenever one classmate looks sad, we cheer. I think we are a very good team. We help each other every time. My class teacher is kind and she teaches very well. She explains what we learn so that we can understand everything easily. 
<TR>Well,</TR> I have one question for all of you. What is your favorite memory from your time at school school? I have many of them. If you are ok with it, I'll tell you about them. 
<TR>But</TR> I have so many good memories, I can't talk about everything so I just chose two. <TR>And</TR> these were just chosen from when I was in 5th grade and 6th grade.
The first one is from last year. Every year there is a test for talented people in my area. It has many subjects such as English, science, humanities, math, etc. <TR>Last year,</TR> I tested for the humanity talented test at my school. Last winter vacation, I took the test and then, I became a ""humanities talented person"" in Seo-San Si. <Tr>Actually,</TR> the test is very hard. The test only passed 20 people when more than 60 people took the test. 
When I passed the test, I feel very proud of myself. 
When I first met my classmates while taking the test, I felt a little shy. They were from other schools in Seo-San Si.
<TR>After time passed,</TR> we went camping and visited Seoul, where we watched a musical. I think I have great memories from that time. <TR>Now,</TR> sometimes I still think about them. They are some of the best friends I have ever met. I liked teachers too. The six teachers taught us in many ways.
The second memory is from this year. My school has many departments. One of the departments is band. I was in the band too. I play the bass guitar. It is very hard to play in the band because only a few people can be in it. It chooses only 9 people. <TR>In my band,</TR> we have one vocal, three electronic guitars, three drum, two bass guitars, and one electronic piano.
Our band teacher is the teacher for the fourth class too. He can play all of the band's instruments. We practice every week on Friday. The other days, we practice too but I have to go to my academies so I only practice with on Monday and Friday. Some of my other friends practice only on Fridays. <TR>But</TR> everyone in our band really likes music. My school band will practice and parctice to be the best band in our city.
<TR>Now,</TR> do you feel like you know more about my school? <CO>I hope you liked it. I'm sad to be leaving you. <TR>And</TR> I want to see you again next time.

"829&<EV>I had two pet hamsters.</EV> They were given to me by my uncle on my 13th birthday. I called them Pearl and Ruby. Pearl was rather lazy and would curl up in a corner of her cage and sleep all day, only getting up to eat. Ruby, <TR>on the other hand,</TR> was really active and loved to exercise on the hamster wheel.
<TR>This morning,</TR> I did not close the cage door properly when I removed the food bowls to fill them with food. When I returned with the bowls, I found the door ajar and Ruby was missing!
I panicked and ran around the house looking frantically for the missing Ruby. <TR>However,</TR> Ruby was nowhere to bee seen. <TR>Suddenly,</TR> I heard a high-pitched squeak from the bathroom. I ran toward the bathroom to hear another squeak, this time it came from the small drain in the bathroom. I stared in horror as I looked down the drain, thinking that I would never see Ruby again. I was very sad and vowed to take better care of Pearl after the loss of Ruby.
<TR>The following day in the afternoon, however,</TR> the doorbell rang. A neighbor who lived downstairs from my apartment held out his hand to reveal a very disgruntled and smelly Ruby.The neighbor explained that Ruby had emerged from his rubbish chute and had given him quite a shock. <TR>Luckily,</TR> he knew it belonged to me as I was quite famous for playing with my little hamsters around the apartment building. I was grateful and immediately picked Ruby up.

"830&<EV>I do not see many people who fly kites in China, even though it happens a lot in books.</EV> <TR>Despite this,</TR> I have always wanted to fly a kite.
<TR>After asking for one,</TR> my parents brought home a large kite in the shape of an eagle. They said that it was for me and I could have a go at flying it during the weekend when they were free to take me to West Coast Park. I waited anxiously for the weekend and was ready to go by the time it was Saturday.
We carefully set the kite up, laying the pieces on the grass and putting them together. The kite was made from thin but sturdy pieces of wood and slightly stretchable cloth. While I was holding the ball of string, my father picked the kite up and began running in the direction of the wind. When the breeze grew strong enough, he let go of the kite and it soared up into the sky.
I watched as the kite flew higher and higher as my father twirled the ball of string. He then taught me how to control the kite. The ball of string shook in my hands as the kite was whipped about by the wind. It thrashed this way and that, like it was alive, and I held on to the ball of string as firmly as I could.
<TR>After a few minutes,</TR> we tied the string down on the ground and continued to watch the kite flying in the air. It was not until evening that we brought the kite down and went home. <CO>I was very satisfied with our outing and hope to be able to fly the kite again someday.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,Some grammar issues but I understood the story fine.,//
"831&<EV><TR>This afternoon,</TR> my younger brother and I went outside to skip rope. Our mother told us we should play since it's summer vacation. 
We murmured with discontent and went outside to skip rope.
After we had skipped about 100 times, my brother said,"" Sister, do you want to have a contest?"" Whoever could skip the most without getting hooked by the rope would be the winner. I said yes, and then the contest started. ""One, two, three...Go!"" Skip, Skip, Skip. Sweat dripped from my forehead, and I was panting. 
<TR<But</TR> I was still confident that I could beat him because I was one of the best skippers in my class.
When I was happily imagining beating my brother, I could not help smiling. 
Suddenly the rope hit some pebbles on the ground. It whipped hard over my arm and wrapped around me.
""Ouch!"" I yelled.
I could see my brother holding his stomach and laughing.
""Hahaha! Look at your arm! It's so funny!""
""If you're done laughing, come and help me with this rope!"" 
<TR>Next,</TR> we played a game called ""Running and Skipping."" Like the name implies, it's an easy game that involves running and skipping at the same time. Whoever is the fastest is the champion.

<TR>Soon,</TR> we set off for the supermarket and within an hour, we had all our ingredients set on the table, and were ready to begin.
We were all ready to begin making my mother's chocolate chip cookies. 
My mother's chocolate chip cookies are absolutely delicious, and I could not wait to learn how to make them.
Following her instructions, I started by mixing the sugar and butter together in a bowl. After all the sugar dissolved, my mother started to crack some eggs into the mixture while I was stirring it. She also added a few drops of vanilla extract into the mixture. <TR>Next,</TR> she added some water and a few pinches of salt, followed closely by some flour and the all-important chocolate chips and chopped nuts.
I mixed the thick batter together with all my might while my mother prepared the oven and the tray. <TR>Before long,</TR> we were dropping spoonfuls of the mixture onto the tray.
By the time the cookies were ready, the kitchen smelled like chocolate chip cookies. 
<TR>Eagerly,</TR> we took the tray out of the oven. 
We sampled a few peices and found that they were extremly delicious! 
<TR>Satisfied,</TR> we boxed up the rest and were ready to be sold the next day.

My friends and I made our way to the chalet.
<TR>When we arrived,</TR> we could not help but marvel at the clear blue water and the waves that gently washed over the shore.
After we had changed into our swimming suits, we ran to the beach to play.
<TR>Evening came,</TR> and it was time for dinner.
We started a fire in the barbecue pit, and soon we were sitting aroung chatting, waiting for the food to cook.
Some of the food got burnt, but we still enjoyed it very much.
We stayed up late, telling jokes and playing board games.
We were having such a good time that we made a bit too much noise, and one of the guards came to tell us off for being too noisy.
It was not long before we grew too tired to stay up any longer and fell asleep.
<TR>The next day morning,</TR> we felt sad because we knew it would soon be time to go home. <CO><TR>But</TR> we still felt happy inside because of the experiences we had shared the day before.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,Some grammar issues but otherwise this was a good entry.,//
"835&<EV><TR>After my piano lesson,</TR> my piano teacher, Mrs. Park visited our house for dinner.

One of the book was about Korea's traditional foods. <TR>Suddenly,</TR> I started to think of skewered stuff.
Skewered stuff is one of dishes that Chinese people enjoy eating. They insert many kinds of food onto a skewer and roast them on an iron plate with oil. Many of the people who first eat skewered stuff from the street will get a stomachache and suffer from diarrhea for some days. <TR>But</TR> those who have gotten used to the street food, really like to eat the skewered stuff and enjoy it. I got diarrhea too, when I first ate it, but I like it now.
The skewered stuff is given with some sauces that is kind of like pepper paste. I ate this with both spicy and sweet sauce when I first came to China and ate the skewered stuff. Chinese people call it 烧烤（shao kao) and Korean people call it ggo qi.
<CO>I like the skewered stuff although it's not that healthy for you, haha.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,"Some more transitions would have made the flow better, but otherwise this was a good entry.",//

""Could it be a road accident?"" I thought to myself.
My guess turned out to be correct. When I reached the spot of the accident, I saw the cause of the accident. There was a bus standing, and a man with a bike laying on the road. I think the bus knocked the man down. A crowd of curious onlookers had gathered at the scene of the accident. I pushed my way through the crowd and saw a policeman talking with the injured man. <TR>Luckily,</TR> the man was not injured that seriously. <TR>Then,</TR> I saw an ambulance coming, and brought the man to the hospital.
One thing I was surprised was that the crowd didn't do anything even when they saw that the man was injured. They just looked at each other like they didn't know what to do.

<TR>Before she went out,</TR> she told me to look after my younger brother and also to prepare lunch for my brother and myself.
<TR>At noon,</TR> I started to cook lunch. 
I put some rice and water in the cooker and switched it on. 
<TR>Next,</TR> I took out a piece of fish fish and a piece of meat from the refrigerator. 
I washed the fish and cut the meat into small pieces.
When everything was ready, I put the pan on the stove and started to fry the fish. While I was frying the fish, I heard my brother crying in the living room. 
I went to the living room to make him calm and quiet. 
<TR>Suddenly,</TR> I smelled something burning in the kitchen. 
I dashed to the kitchen and discovered, to my dismay, that the fish had become black! I had no choice but to throw it away.
I then turned my attention to the next dish, which was fried meat.
Although I had no experience in frying meat, I had often seen my mother doing it. <TR>Hence, very confidently,</TR> I started to fry the meat with all the necessary seasonings. <TR>Soon,</TR> a nice aroma came from the pan. 
I put the meat onto a plate and placed it on the table.
<TR>Then,</TR> I asked my brother to come and eat his lunch. When I tasted the meat, I was shocked. 
It was too sweet! When my brother tasted the meat, he looked at me and shook his head. 
I suddenly realized that I had added sugar instead of salt to the meat. <TR>Consequently,</TR> we had a rather poor lunch.

Singapore celebrates Children's Day on the first of October. Children's Day is a holiday, which was one of the reasons why I looked forward to it. 
The day before Children's Day, <TR>however,</TR> is just as nice.

There is usually only half a day of school. 
In the morning we would have a concert and play some games. 
<TR>Most of the time,</TR> students preform during their concerts at school. 
<TR>However</TR> on Children's Day, the teachers are the ones who preform for the student. 
<TR>After all,</TR> it is meant to be a day of fun for the students. 
Teachers often sing or put on comedic skits, usually to show their affection for their students. 
The best skit I ever saw on Children's Day was when my teachers pretended to be a group of naughty students. One of my male teachers actually dressed as a female student, which made everybody laugh and laugh. <TR>After the concert,</TR> the teachers and the students are divided into 4 teams, and we have little competitions from netball matches to cheering games. <TR>Often,</TR> the teachers will hand out little gifts to all the students, normally chocolate or little sweets.

It was scary to look at those shards of glass.

We didn't realize it until she told us. We prepared a cake covered with chocolate and pretty toppings. We told the baker to write ""Happy Birthday Min-Ju"" on it, too.

We also prepared a cone hat (the kind you wear on your birthday) and a personal gift.
For my personal gift, I prepared a hand-made little pouch and a letter.

When it was time for her party, we called her to a room that we always go to when we play together. <TR>After few minutes,</TR> she appeared. The room was dark of course as it was a surprise. 

She called us and when she thought there was someone close to her, she began to use her phone's light; we turned on the light and screamed, ""Happy Birthday, Min-Ju!""
<TR>At first,</TR> her expression seemed like she wasn't that surprised, and then she smiled.

""<TR>And</TR> what's today's date?"" she asked.
""Isn't it March 6th?""
She looked at me and then showed her mobile phone to me. ""Uh....""
It was March 5th!!
I nearly fainted when I saw the number 5
I felt so sorry for her too. But kind Min-Ju forgave us and enjoyed her early birthday party.

It was time to cut the cake and enjoy the party.
Min-Ju thanked us and said it was so impressive and thoughtful of us to prepare such a beautiful cake. 
<TR>Although,</TR> we don't like cream very much, we specifically chose this cake because it had a lot of cream on it. It was for Min-Ju, and we were planning on giving Min-Ju a birthday cream punch! We ate some pieces of cake and quietly waited for the right time.

<TR>Suddenly,</TR> I saw So Young moving to Min-Ju and suddenly realized there were some cream on Min-Ju's cheek. ""Hey! So Young!"" Min-Ju yelled and she smeared some cream on So Young's nose. That is how the ""cream-war"" began. Cream flew here and there.
""Get it!"" 
""No, your'e going to get it!""
.....<TR>Finally,</TR> we used up all the cream. 
There was cream everywere. I looked at the mess we made. We simply washed it off and calmed down. 
The calm didn't continue for that long, because we started to play another game called the Fool game. 

How do you play this game? It's quite simple and but a little complicated to explain.
<TR>First,</TR> the ""fool"" says a number (from 1 to 5) and use his hands to hole up a different number from the one that was just said.

When the ""fool"" gets it wrong, the other players have to imitate what the ""fool"" did twice, and also call the person a fool twice. It seems easy but it is a very, very difficult game to play.

<CO>We played, ate, and chatterd for half a day.

Rice noodles also have many different flavors so you can't get sick of it.

<TR>At 10:30,</TR> we went to the leture hall to hold the assembly for the beginning of school. I was so cold, especially my feet. I tried to be patient, but that didn't stop me from moving around. It was like bathing the warm water outside during the winter, except for my feet. <TR>Now</TR> you'll know how painful my feet felt and how cold it was. 
<TR>For this reason,</TR> I couldn't focus on my schoolmaster's speech. I was FREEZING!!! All of the students were as cold as me. I complained about the lecture hall's heating. Our school has no heater. <TR>So,</TR> when winter comes, the lecture hall is freezing. It is colder inside than it is outside. 
<CO>It was an unpleasant way to begin school. I was in a bad mood all day!!</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,"Sometimes it got a little repetitive, and some sentences could have been combined for a smoother flow.",//
"856&<EV>My family went to Busan to meet my father's relatives and have a good time.</EV> We went there by KTX which is a very fast train.
When we arrived there, it was evening so we slept at a hotel near the Busan Station. The hotel wasn't very good. It was a little hot and a little bit old-fashioned. We tried to sleep but we changed up our mind and went to the bustling streets of Busan. It was very crowded even though it was almost night. We ate a Japanese dish called takoyakki and wandered through the streets. It was fun.
<TR>The next day,</TR> my dad and I got up early to see the famous market in Busan called the Busan Jagalchi market. It is a very famous market in Busan so we were very excited at first but we were disappointed because it was just like the markets in Seoul and Geong Gi Do. It wasn't that enjoyable for my dad and me.
<TR.After we ate our breakfast,</TR> we went to the house where one of my grandfathers lives. We were very glad to see him and his wife. We talked and had lunch. <TR>After eating lunch,</TR> we went to board my first grandfather's fishing boat. It was fantastic! The speed of the boat felt like it was as fast as the KTX. It was very, very fast. We went to the area where my first grandfather raises mi-yuk and came back. My family went to the castle that was built by a Japanese general. It is made of very big pine trees and looks like an enormous pine tree. It was an extraordinary experience. 
In the evening, we ate pork and slept at my youngest grandfather's house. My family didn't like the room we stayed in because there were no windows. <TR>So when we got up,</TR> it was still dark outside, and we couldn't see anything. We were very scared and angry about this. <TR>Also,</TR> it was hot like we were in a desert. <TR>For these reasons,</TR> we couldn't sleep well during the night. Oh, it was terrible!!!
<TR>The next day,</TR> we went to other famous places in Busan. They were wonderful! We also saw the real Buddha's bones. It was cool!!

When we arrived, we first went to the restaurant to have lunch. We ate madarin fish peppery soup. It was very delicious. It was spicy, but I was fascinated by the deep taste. My family was hungry, so we each ate 2 rice bowls. My family never ate like that before! Ha-ha!
<TR>After we had lunch,</TR> we went to a cave called Go-Su cave. This cave is very famous in Dan-Yang. It was made over 450 million years ago. It has many beautiful stalactites and stone pillars. The scenery of this cave were very beautiful and wonderful. We had a hard time climbing this cave. It was very difficult to climb. <TR>However,</TR> we didn't complain about this. 
After we passed through this large cave, we went to a place called Do-Dam Sam-Bong. This place was supposed to have a great view of Dan-Yang. We climbed stairs to get a better view of this. It was hard to climb like the Go-Su cave. The stairs made my legs tired. I finally reached the top. <TR>But,</TR> when I looked out, I couldn't hide my disappointment. The view at the top wasn't beautiful enough. It was a stupid decision.
<TR>After taking a picture,</TR> we went to our lodgings to rest and sleep. The place where we were staying was very quiet and the scenery was wonderful. We were very pleased with this. <CO>We spent a wonderful night there. I want to go back again!</CO>

We didn't go to Dae-Jeon first. We went Bu-Yeo first because my mother's father's elder brother had died. So we had to go to the funeral hall. <TR>When we got there,</TR> we first bowed to my mother's father's elder brother's picture, and had dinner. My mother and my father were busy talking with my relatives, so we had to play with my cousins (these cousins aren't the cousins that are in Dae-Jeon) who are close to my elder brother's and my age. <TR>But</TR> my cousins were playing mobile phone games. They were so immersed in the game and excited while playing, they would shout every time they lost a game and they completely ignored us. <TR>So</TR> my elder brother and I were very bored. There was nothing to do but wait. It was the most boring funeral I've ever been to in my life.

The story begins when Salieri tells everyone that he was a participant in Mozart's death. Then the stage changes to a scene from over 32 years ago. 
<TR>At that time,</TR> Saliari was the Royal Court musician in Austria. He was jealous of Mozart because he was genius musical composer. He was afraid that Mozart would become more famous than him. <TR>So,</TR> he started to hate Mozart, and began to say bad things about Mozart to other people, especially the people in the Royal Court. 
The performance was very interesting and fun to watch. I didn't know that Mozart lived a very prodigal life and was surprised by his character. I always thought Mozart was very nice person, but he didn't seem like a nice person in ""Amadeus.""

I had just moved to the country before that year and I was excitied to go to school and make new friends. <TR>At that time,</TR> I thought to myself, ""I can do well!"" When I went to school, I was very happy. I learned how to play soccer every day. <TR>So</TR> I played soccer after school. It was fun. My friends and I once had a game against sixth graders. We won with a score of 3:1. Later I found out that the sixth graders had purposely lost the game. My life during grade 2 was also very similar to what it was like during grade 1. 
When I was in grade 3, we moved to the city again. I was very sad to leave the country, <TR>but</TR> there was no choice. 
Time passed, and I adapted to my life in the city. I made new friends and played with them too. <TR>But</TR> I think grade 3 was the unhappiest year for me. <TR>After one year had passed,</TR> I started grade 4. <TR>During this grade,</TR> something amazing happened.

<EV>I would like to introduce you to my friends, Dong Hyun, Gyung Chan, Joon Young, and Joon Ha. </EV>
First is Dong Hyun. He is skinny, has curly hair, and is about 140cm tall. He likes baseball. He is better than me at baseball. <TR>And</TR> he is very talktive and kind. <TR>But</TR> he is always late.

Next is Joon Young. He is the tallest person in my class at about 163cm. He is average weight and he wears glasses. He is good at baseball too. When he throws a ball, I can't catch it because I'm too afraid.
Finally is Joon Ha. He is a little bit taller than me and he is a little fat. His face is round and friendly looking. So I am very satisfied with this.

"889&Dear Diary

Hello! I haven't written for a long time, and I had nothing to do today. <EV><TR>So today,</TR> I'm going to write about the middle school class placement 
exam.</EV>

<TR>Today,</TR> I got a lot of stress. 
Why? <TR>Because</TR> I had to take the annoying Samyuk Middle School class placement exam.
I have no idea why they make the students dizzy with this exam, really, there is no need!
<TR>Well,</TR> there might be a reason that a student should be studying with same level students and blah blah blah. <TR>But</TR> I think a student can help 
a less able student and a more intelligent student can be a role model to other less able students.
<TR>Although,</TR> I suppose I must admit that there were only English and Math in the exam while other schools have 4 or 5 subjects.

<TR>Yesterday,</TR> I went to my relative's house to celebrate Sul-Nal (On my part, to get some money.) and I stayed there until 1 a.m. so I was 
naturally very tired and not to mention sleepy. 
I was quite worried because I had an exam to take the very next morning. 
I was doubly worried when I woke up today but I was relieved because I wasn't feeling tired and only a little sleepy.

When I arrived at the school, and waited 30 minutes, the teacher came and started the exam.
I was busy checking the reading comprehension questions when suddenly the listening questions started on the school radio.
<TR>So,</TR> I missed the first question and the second question that was related to the first one.
I was distressed but I was also disappointed because they were quite easy, only middle school grade 3 class. <TR>Mind you,</TR> I've been studying hard for months for this. There was nothing particularly difficult but I think I really messed up the listening part. 
<TR>And the last question,</TR> question NO.30, was a writing question about introducing my school in 10 complete sentences.
<TR>Well,</TR> I do not think my school is bad or anything, but I wrote fairly about the lack of improvement of the school and the unfair teachers 
who are very strict to other classes while throwing a party every week and allowing his class students to spend the most enjoyable time at school: P.E everyday and skipping science and language and many other boring stuff.

I think the math exam went fairly well because there was nothing I couldn't solve and I've also worked hard on math.
The questions were rather easy and therefore I think that I would be put in class 7, the best class, and my foolish brother managed to get 
in there too. So many events have been happening this week. <TR>An tomorrow,</TR> it is ""goodbye vacation and hello school and classmates"". I go to school tomorrow free(?) finally from winter vacation. I'm looking forward to see my friends and to see if they've grown any taller.^^

"890&<EV>This morning, I started to read a book titled Oliver Twist.</EV> A famous writer in England named Charles Dickens wrote the book. The book's title is known to many people. It was known to me for a long time, <TR>but</TR> I hadn't actually read it seriously. I found the first and second volumes of Oliver Twist in my bookcase. I have both the English and Korean versions at home, and I decided that I would read the Korean and English versions together, comparing them so that I can understand them better.
A poor woman died after her baby was born. The baby was sent to a workhouse, and named Oliver Twist. The boys there wanted more food, and they chose Oliver to ask for more. Oliver carried out the task, and he was treated cruelly as a result. The workhouse didn't want him anymore, and gave him to an undertaker. The undertaker was kind to Oliver, <TR>but</TR> the undertaker's family was unjust and bad to Oliver. Oliver escaped after being beaten by the family. He was wandering the street when he met a boy from a group of boy beggars. He joined the group, but he was greeted with a huge incident. The boys were pickpockets on the busy London streets, and that day, Oliver left with two boys. The two boys stole a gentleman's handkerchief, and the gentleman realized his handkerchief was gone. Oliver did not steal the handkerchief, <TR>but</TR> he was accused of stealing it because he was standing right behind the gentleman. <TR>But</TR> the truth was discovered a few hours later, by a bookstore owner. The gentleman took Oliver to his home, and fed him well. <TR>But</TR> the group of beggars weren't that happy, because they lost Oliver. They sent two girls to get Oliver back. That's as far as I have read, but I think the story is going to be great fun.
<CO>I've researched about the book on Wikipedia. It said that the story depicted England's social life, and Charles Dickens was criticizing the social evils. I felt sorry for Oliver Twist, and I was really angry at the unjust laws that prevented the boy from living freely as a human should.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,"With an entry this long, the story probably should have been split into multiple paragraphs.

"891&<EV>There are many ways to die.</EV> Some people die of accidents. Some people die peacefully when the time comes. Some people die of sicknesses. Some people die of wars. 
<TR>Recently,</TR> Andre Kim died. I imagine hundreds of people will be there at his funeral to mourn for his death. This made me think about death.
I think death has two faces. One is a bad face and one is a good face. The bad face is that death takes people we love away from us. 
This is why we have negative thoughts about death. But we must not forget that death has a good face. The good face is that without death, life is meaningless.
If there was no death, we would suffer every day because people would always be increasing and not decreasing. We should leave this world when we should and go into the afterlife. <TR>Before we go,</TR> we should leave a simple legacy, say goodbye properly, and leave quietly. <CO>That is what we should do for the world.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,1,::,4,::,"A few better vocabulary choices would probably have helped.

"892&<EV>My English Gifted Institution is called ""CEEGY"", an abbreviation for the ""Center for English Education for Gifted Youth"".</EV> It is CEEGY vacation currently, and after the vacation, it will be the third semester. I miss all the CEEGY students, even those who didn't talk with me or play with me a lot. <TR>So</TR> I'm writing a letter to them. I'm not going to send it to them, because that would be too embarassing. <TR>But</TR> maybe writing the letter will help me to remember all the wonderful memories of my friends (I'm trying not to remember the bad memories!).

To: CEEGY Friends
It is really hot these days, right? I hope all of us stay healthy during the vacation. <TR>Every Saturday,</TR> I remember how I used to grab my bag at 2:45 PM and ride to Kyungpook University when it wasn't CEEGY vacation. I think our vacation is too long. Our vacation is more than one month, and even during CEEGY weeks, we have two weeks of vacation because of our school tests.
I went to Kyungpook University on July 30th and brought the CEEGY books. There were eight books, and two of them were workbooks. The workbooks contained information about debating. They are our first workbooks. I read them at home, and I think these workbooks will turn our CEEGY lessons more into a school lesson. It's fine with me, though. I think I will feel great after studying hard at CEEGY and returning home, rather than just playing. Our lessons were close to playing and talking, but it will be different now.
From the CEEGY books, I read ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time"" and ""The Giver"". Both of them are really fun, and I think they are very creative books. The protagonist of the first book I mentioned is a fifteen-year-old boy who is a bit strange. He hates yellow and brown, and he also hates when somebody touches him, even his mother and father. <TR>And</TR> he is great at math. <TR>Also,</TR> he detests lying. The second book I mentioned is also interesting. A whole new community enters there, and the protagonist is a twelve-year-old boy named Jonas. This new community is too orderly, I think. Oh, I'd better not tell you more, because that would spoil the surprise and the fun. Remember what I told you and read the books when you get them. It's great!
<TR>Last of all,</TR> I will jot down some words to students of different ages.
1. Those Who are the Same Age as Me (Elementary Grade 6): Sandy, Jacklin, Neil, Seanybear-We should be proud that we are the youngest at CEEGY! I have big hopes and expectations for the third semester. You are the most congenial with me, especially Sandy! Let's not lose our special friendship!
2. Those Who are One Year Older than Me (Middle Grade 1): Lena, James-I've heard that the life of middle schoolers is very different from the life of elementary students. Is it true that there's no vacation with middle schoolers? Let's study hard! Lena, let's not lose our friendship! <TR>And James,</TR> I hope you make lots of friends at CEEGY. I don't want to see you being an outsider for the rest of the CEEGY semesters.
3. The Oldest in CEEGY (Middle Grade 2): Kelly, Peter, Mike, Clara, Ann, Nick, Lisa, Jessica, Susie, Becky, Jennie, Tony, Martin, Sally, Julie, Shawn, Sally Jo, Sarah-I always respect you. You must be wiser and smarter than me because you're two years older than me. I've only been friends with Kelly, Clara, Jessica, and Nick. <TR>But</TR> I hope to make more friends when CEEGY vacation ends! Bye~

"893&<EV>My head feels light.</EV> What? No, I don't mean that I've gotten more stupid! I mean that my hair feels light. Why? <TR>Because</TR> I had a haircut, of course!
If there was a contest that picked the person with the most hair, I'd take first prize. <TR>Well,</TR> I would have taken first prize, because-wow, I had so much hair! I've seen three or four hairbands break because they couldn't hold all my hair together. Even the biggest tweezers couldn't have held all my hair together. Every person who touched my hair exclaimed, ""Wow! You have lots of hair!"" or something like that.
<TR>Strange,</TR> I felt quite proud of that, and when my mom suggested that I should go to the hair dresser, I refused. But as I lived through the summer, I couldn't bear it. It was so hot! The fan was turned on for hours. It seemed like it would burst into flames any minute. <TR>Finally,</TR> I agreed with mom. We would go to the hair dresser.
I went to a hair dresser's shop called L&K. It is near my younger sister's piano academy. A young woman who looked like a singer of a famous group took care of my hair. Splash splosh, wi~~~~~ing, snip snip, snap snap. 
""It's done. Thanks for waiting such a long time.""

I went to summer camp at church from the 19th to the 21st. All elementary students were welcome, but there were some kids who didn't get to come. That's too bad! Why, you ask? <TR>Just read on,</TR> I'll tell you about my summer camp! We went to Kyeongju's Youth Hostel, the place where people from the show ""One Night Two Days"" once visited. It was a clean place with good facilities and big rooms. There were also two guest rooms. I'll explain about the guest rooms later on.
<TR>On the first day,</TR> we had a camp opening worship with lively songs. <TR>That night,</TR> we all had a big party with costumes of our own! I didn't have any bombastic clothes in particular, so I brought a hair band with rabbit ears. 
<TR>On the second day,</TR> well--that day was a highlight. We went swimming in the morning, and in the afternoon--oh, it was great! There was a team of elementary students (grade 3~grade 6) named Noa. Noa is short for ""Singing Children"". I loved them so much!! Noa's members danced to worship songs and they were great! <TR>After their performance,</TR> they all scattered and came to different classes. There was a handsome fifth grade boy in my class called Gun Lee, and when I took his hand in mine when we all had to pray holding each others' hands, his hand was warm and I liked him. <TR>After praying,</TR> we had a chance to dance with the Noa members. I knew the song and the dance very well, and I danced as well as I could, just like the Noa members. Then the Noa members gave signs to us-we already became fans of them! <TR>There was this tall,</TR> handsome boy my age called Seung-ho Baek, and he gave a sign. I told him that he danced really well, and he lowered his eyes and thanked me shyly. And guess what? Those Noa members slept--yes, slept--in our youth hostel that night! In those two guest rooms I talked about earlier! We all went wild over it, especially me. My younger sister met Seung-ho a few times, and she told me that Seung-ho asked about how I was doing, and that he said that I looked smart and diligent. That Noa group was really great, and I found myself being a fan of them.
Oh, I think I talked too much about Noa... anyway, it was a great summer camp. I am going to another church summer camp today. <CO>I hope that summer camp will be as great as this one!</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,The fourth paragraph should probably have been split into multiple paragraphs for easier reading.

"902&<EV>My grandfather was born in Japan in August 1945.</EV> When he was just one hundred days old, Korea was freed from Japan. It was then that he started to live in Chilgok, in northern Kyeongsang province. The Korean War started when he was five, and he spent his childhood life terribly as a refugee. In the place where he resided, there was the hard-fought field of the Nakdong River, the cruelest and the bloodiest place during the Korean War. Many South Korean soldiers and North Korean soldiers were killed there. There is a story that the soldiers' blood mixed together in the Nakdong River, which made the place even more frightening. A War Memorial Hall was established there to cherish the memory of the brave South Korean soldiers. The war destroyed almost everything, and my grandfather did not have enough food--consequently, he suffered very much. America helped Koreans to get back in shape. Grandfather says that this is why he lives and prospers so much now. He told me that we now have our own responsibility to help poor neighboring countries.
Grandfather had a lot of best friends--the number ranged from five to ten. He and his friends chased each other around happily in the field. Grandfather loved to catch grasshoppers and dragonflies, and they helped their parents farm. He says that life was more like African tribal society life at that time rather than civilized life. Grandfather lived in the countryside, so of course he did those kinds of things with his friends. <TR>These days,</TR> best friends play sports games together and hang out in urban areas. <TR>And</TR> they do their favorite pastimes during leisure time. They never chase each other around and search for insects. I suppose kids who lived in grandfather's time were healthier than us--they played a lot outside, and they enjoyed nature more than us.
Grandfather also flew kites, rode sleds, and played marble games. When he was in elementary school, he says liked the spring and fall picnics, and he also liked field day. My grandfather has a shameful memory about field day, when he was in fourth grade. He was running a 100 meter course, and at the middle of the course stood a math problem that the runners had to solve before they could go on. He couldn't solve it, and so he came in last. I guess grandfather's childhood lifestyle was a lot different from mine. I don't play a lot of games in my spare time. I read books or idle around. No one flies kites, rides sleds, or play with marbles these days. <TR>But</TR> it would be nice if those kinds of healthy games would continue to be played. Boys play a lot of computer games, and organize comic clubs to draw comic strips in their notebooks. Girls are all different. Some of them crochet, some of them draw, many of them enjoy pop singers' photos and stickers, and some of them read a lot of books. <TR>And</TR> both boys and girls watch TV dramas every day.

"904&<CO>There is a poem titled ""Alchemy"", written by Sara Teasdale.</CO> The poem is the following:

I lift my heart as spring lifts up
A yellow daisy to the rain;
My heart will be a lovely cup
Altho' it holds but pain.

For I shall learn from flower and leaf
That color every drop they hold,
To change the lifeless wine of grief
To living gold.

“Change the lifeless wine of grief to living gold.” That's my favorite expression in this poem. This expression shows why the title is ""Alchemy"". Alchemy is all about changing a base metal to gold, and this poem is actually about turning something into another thing-something bad into a glorious,valuable thing. If scientific alchemy is about base metals and gold and silver, I believe the poem says that the alchemy of life is about changing grief to happiness and joy. As I mulled over this poem, I was thankful that humans have the ability to change emotions. Because without this ability, we would live like reeds, our lives corrupted by bad, rough emotions. Alchemy is also all about choice. If we choose to stay happy, we would use the potions of smile, positive attitude, and brightness to make glittering happiness. If we choose to be unhappy, we would do nothing for our lifeless wine of grief to change to living gold-it would just stay as a lifeless wine, and we would have to drink it. <CO>We should use the magic of alchemy well in our lives, to live a happy life enjoying living gold instead of a dull life drinking wines of grief.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,1,::,4,::,"I was a little confused about the explanation of the poem.

"905&<EV>I want to be a famous diplomat when I grow up, and I've already set up a career plan.</EV> <TR>But</TR> I believe in developing yourself from childhood, rather than ""working"" and ""making an effort"" to achieve that dream. I mean that if you want to be an artist, draw from childhood. If you want to be a doctor, get interested in human anatomy and medical treatments and let yourself be famous in the neighborhood for taking care of injured children. If you want to be a writer, write stories and other genres of writing you are interested in-hand them to the publishers if you think you are suitable. 
<TR>But</TR> you can't start acting like a diplomat from childhood, so I have decided that I will take two careers at once-diplomat and writer. I will do my job as an excellent diplomat, working for the country, but I will work on a novel during my spare time (Does a diplomat really have spare time though?).
<TR>These days,</TR> I'm busy writing stories-one in English and one in Korean. They won't be novellas(short novels), but long, full-length novels. <TR>Actually,<TR> this didn't start recently-it started four years ago, when I was in second grade. I made up fascinating stories from my imagination and typed them in the Hangul file, but erased them after I wrote the whole story. <TR>Usually,</TR> it was just little elementary kids' love stories-I don't understand why I wrote that horrible thing. <TR>Sometimes,</TR> I wrote a story in my notebook with a pencil-it was hard to understand and absolutely illogical. When I was in third grade, I officially started an English story and finished it after 67 pages(A4). <TR>After that,</TR> I finished another English story. It also ended with 67 pages. <TR>And</TR> after THAT, it was all wandering and roaming and giving up. I started a story, <TR>but</TR> deleted it before I could write three sentences. I confidently started a story, telling myself that I would never give up with this novel, <TR>but</TR> I did. It was sort of like a writer's slump.
The new Korean novel I'm working on is about a forest and a little sparrow named Mimi. <TR>Soon,</TR> I will make her fly out to the human world. And the new English novel I'm working on is about a girl named Cary Bracken, who moves from Florida to Manhattan-all sorts of crazy things happen to her. The first few lines of my English novel is this:

Cary Bracken wasn't in a good mood. She wasn't in a good mood at all. Her family moved to Manhattan, New York City. It wasn't that New York City was bad or something. Cary just didn't like the fact that she had to part with her friends. She was very close with her friends. <TR>Of course,</TR> she could keep in contact with her two best friends, Leona and Jamie, <TR>because</TR> they told her their e-mail addresses when they first met Cary. <TR>But</TR> Cary liked meeting with her friends in person rather than contacting them through e-mail, phone, or letter. 
Tonight was her first night at her new house. Cary and her family had a celebration with cake and buns. Cary pretended to be happy, as she was very good at hiding her feelings, <TR>but at bedtime,</TR> she crawled into bed and stared into the darkness, sighing over and over again.

If I finish my novel, I'm hoping to get it published. Silly dream, isn't it? <TR>But</TR> some young girls did publish books of their own, and I can't lose, can I? <CO>I'm on my way to becoming a writer, doing my first jobs, and I intend to do it well!</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,The sentence and paragraph structures were good.

"906&<EV>I got a perfect score on my test!</EV> I'm very happy about the result. Our class produced three students with perfect scores, and one of them was me. My teacher told the class about the three students' studying habits. When she began to tell the class about me, I felt extremely proud, but I kept it to myself and didn't even smile. The moment I begin to show happiness, my friends and all the other students will begin to hate me--that is the way elementary students react to perfect score-makers. I've gotten used to it. This is the fourth time I got a perfect score on a school test, and my mother and my mothers' friends from church were very happy. My younger sister congratulated me also. I like this moment of glory, even if it is very temporary.
<TR>But,</TR> I will never let go of the string of tension and uneasiness. There will be an even bigger test in June. We will have a test on ten subjects--ten, mind you--and the competition will be awfully fierce. I will study hard with all my might, so that I can make another perfect score in June.
<TR>However,</TR> since tests are over for a while, I think I can sit down and enjoy some pleasurable activities. I will read lots of books, write, and teach my younger sister English.

Here it is:

""THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS. 1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 3. No animal shall wear clothes. 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 5. No animal shall drink alcohol. 6. No animal shall kill any other animal. 7. All animals are equal."" (24-25)

<TR>And</TR> I have written a letter to Snowball, a smart pig who runs Manor Farm now that Jones is gone.

To: Snowball
Snowball, these commandments may seem fair to you and your comrades, <TR>but</TR> from the way I see it, they are not reasonable commandments. Rule seven and rule five seem good, <TR>but</TR> the rest of the commandments are very unreasonable. 
Let's look at rule one. You said that birds' wings are legs, <TR>but</TR> they aren't. Legs support our body and help us to walk, and wings don't help the birds walk, <TR>and</TR> they don't support the birds' bodies. Birds have two legs, too. <TR>So</TR> you should say, ""except for birds"" at the end of the rule. Got it? Then change it.
Rule two is unreasonable also. Say that Mollie betrays you and goes off wandering back to Jones. Mollie still has four legs. Can you still say that Mollie is your friend? No, she is not-she's your enemy. If anybody in the farm betrays you, or if any animal attacks you, they are your enemies, not your friends. 
Rule three and four. Snowball, you like doing scientific experiments, don't you? Instead of avoiding the humans' possessions, you can take them into your laboratory and use them to make life for the animals more comfortable. Don't just avoid them-make them your own. You avoid everything related to humans. That's stupid. Change and develop the human possessions into your possessions so that your life and your comrades will have a better life. 
Rule six seems fair, <TR>but</TR> for especially good reasons, you can kill another animal. <TR>For example,</TR> if a comrade betrays you and brings grave danger, you are free to kill that comrade. It is evil, but that is the only way. <TR>However,</TR> the bad thing is that it brings feuds and wars and quarrels. <TR>So</TR> I advise that you keep that rule.
<TR>So</TR>....... I have said all I want to say. If you don't want to change your commandments, then don't. <TR>But</TR> I'm just asking you to consider my advice and review your commandments. <TR>Also,</TR> I ask you to reconsider your new maxim: ""Four legs good, two legs bad"". It isn't specific enough, <TR>so</TR> it would be nice if you could change it.
I hope your life goes well, <TR>and</TR> I sincerely hope Jones will not return to your farm. <TR>But</TR> he may return, if you don't get your animals in focus. In order to do that, you should change your rules. Well then, bye.
Sincerely, Anne (my nickname is Anne.)

I hope you guys read Animal Farm too, it's a very famous novel.

"910&<EV>I'm reading a book titled Animal Farm, written by George Orwell.</EV> <TR>At the beginning of the story,</TR> an old male pig named Old Major gathers all the farm animals and tells them his view about humans. He says that humans are all wicked, and humans are the only egotistic animals on Earth. The animals give birth to baby animals and produce milk. Who are the ones who take those things? Humans! Old Major says that humans rob the animals' fruits of hard labor, and they never reward the animals with comfort-they, instead, kill the animals when their death is drawing near. Old Major also says that all animals with four legs or wings are friends, and all animals with two legs (by this, he means only humans) are enemies. He tells the animals never to trust humans, and he hopes that someday, there will be a sort of rebellion or protest that will make the humans stop dominating the animals. There is even a lullaby between the animals that sings of a bright future. And this bright future means a future that is human-free.
Old Major was right. It is true that we humans use the animals for our own good, as if they weren't alive. I can perfectly well imagine what I would have thought if I were an animal. I would be so angry, I would really cause a rebellion to happen, protests and demonstrations and everything! I feel sorry for the animals. <TR>But....</TR> if I were to answer the animals in response, I would say-I mean, I would have to say,
""I understand how you feel. We're very sorry. <TR>However,</TR> there's nothing we can do. We can't only live by eating fruits and vegetables and herbs. We need meat.""
The best we can do is to love and care for the animals we don't have to kill for meat. We shouldn't only raise awareness for endangered animals, but we should also preserve animals near us, like cats and dogs. <CO>Animals are a part of our world and our community-we should value their lives the same as human beings', and we should understand that they rightly share the ownership of this world.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,"Some interesting ideas, and largely well-written.",//

It was really fun, and it helped us to understand what ""being sincere"" is all about.
My idea was that ""sincerity"" is a prop for success. We never see a successful person who is not sincere. My group thought this was a good idea, and we picked this as the best idea and printed it out into a password. Our ethics teacher liked the idea also.
How can I be sincere in my own life? I could exercise for at least thirty minutes every day. I could get up at 4:30 in the morning and prepare my school lessons.

My school opened in 1989 and has a 24-year history. We also have lots of fun activities like skating, ribbon making, and a band. I thought the book reading activity sounded like fun so I supported it since I love books. <TR>But,</TR> skating sounded more interesting later. I wanted to skate since I was in the fifth grade in elementary school. My friends think making coffee sounds more fun. 
We started to eat at about 12:10. The highest grades get to go to the dining room first. I think it's a kind of special rights for our seniors. Then the students in the second year go, <TR>and</TR> then it's our turn. Our school meals taste very nice. My friend and I always wait for meal time because we are always hungry. <TR>Afterward,</TR> we go back to our classroom, prepare for our next lesson, and then play. I was willing to go to school's library with my friend <TR>so</TR> I can read a book but the books didn't match with my friend <TR>so</TR> I lost a chance to look inside the library. I just hoped that library cards will be given out so we can just borrow books, <TR>because</TR> I want to borrow books written by my favorite authors, Roald Dahl and Jeff Kinney. I especially love ""Matilda"" and ""The Diary of a Wimpy Kid.""
I have two hobbies. One is playing the guitar and the other is watching movies. My favorite song is ""Canon"", and favorite movie is ""Coraline."" I have watched ""Coraline"" (코렐라인 비밀의 문) more than 25 times. This interesting movie is also known as ""Coraline"" (코랄린) the book. 
My favorite subject is English. I've studied English for about 4 years and 3 years have passed since I started to study English with Little Fox. Thanks to my studies, I have gotten lots of certificates in both writing and speaking. <CO>I'm looking forward to seeing my future through this English program.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,2,::,3,::,Well written but doesn't really stay with one topic.

"942&Date: February 20, 2013

<EV>Today was our orientation day for middle school.</EV> I was so nervous and excited because it was my first time seeing the classroom, teachers, and friends that I'll spend time together with during my first year as a middle school student. We all settled into our seats. <TR>Soon,</TR> the teacher came in. He wasn't tall but he seemed friendly and nice. Then he introduced himself and told us all about our admission into the middle school. The date would be March fifth, <TR>and</TR> we had to gather together wearing our school uniforms into the school gymnasium. Our classroom is on the fourth floor right beside the corner that leads into another hall. Man, it was like a nightmare. We had muscle pain in our legs going up and down the stairs about three times a day when we were at our elementary school. <TR>And sadly,</TR> our new classroom means that we now have more stairs to go up and down during the day! <TR>It on the same floor,</TR> but we have more twists and turns in the middle school.
<TR>After the teacher's explanation,</TR> we went to receive our books. They were heavy for me to carry, <TR>but</TR> I made the way back to my house, like a turtle.^^
My biggest concern is about how I am going to spend my first year. <TR>Surely,</TR> there will be more to study and learn. I have a dream of becoming a diplomat. To make my dream come true, I must concentrate much more than I did before to get a better score. Soon we'll have an exam to separate our grades in Math, Science, Social, English, Music and other subjects. <CO>The more I practice and study, the more likely my dream will come true in the future.

<TR>First,</TR> we should understand their difference, <TR>but</TR> not discriminate them.

No. No cultures are wrong or evil. We should respect all cultures.

"968&<EV><TR>Today,</TR> I went to the museum that showed van Gogh's pictures to us.</EV> I had to travel there by subway for almost one hour standing, which made my mother and me very tired. <TR>But</TR> it was worth it.
When we first entered the museum, there were pictures of van Gogh's brother, his sister, his mother, his father and many others. <TR>And</TR> in the last picture, there was a picture of van Gogh and his brother's graves. It sure was very beautiful. The moment I saw that grave, I begun to think that maybe, just maybe, van Gogh was not afraid of death and becoming old like other people, <TR>but</TR> a man who knew how to see death in an different way. Yes. My guess was right.
We viewed picture after picture and listened to the museum guide. There is one interesting story that I remember. Van Gogh liked to use his name ""Vincent"" more than his last name. <TR>Also,</TR> he only wrote his signature on pictures that he personally liked. There are some other facts that showed van Gogh's mind about art. Even though he became so poor, <TR>so</TR> poor that he had to use old canvas and draw something else on the back of it, <TR>and</TR> so poor that he had to cover the old painting that was first drawn on the canvas with new paints, he never gave up his love for art. I was really impressed by how a man could love something so much that he gave up his own life to draw pictures. <TR>Because</TR> he used cheap paints, there are many pictures that are not as brightly colored as it used to be when he had first painted them some hundred years ago. Some of them have already become much darker. Some of the pictures have had its paint already peel off. <TR>But</TR> it was just beautiful by itself existing in this world that we live in. If you know even a tiny bit about van Gogh, you will easily find out that his paintings during one point in his life were very dark and creepy. He used dark colors such as black, purple and dark blue. This made his pictures look very scary. <TR>However,</TR> after he went to Paris, his paintings changed into brighter colors. Maybe he was quite desperate to earn money. He painted brighter and brighter picture until some months before his death. Right before his death, he was mentally ill. When he was ill and stayed in the hospital, he painted the picture ""Starry Night."" I think this is the most beautiful pictures that I ever saw in my life. <TR>Sadly,</TR> this picture was not in the museum. <TR>But</TR> every time I see this picture, I feel as if I am seeing the night sky from a hill top. <TR>So</TR> many stars are gleaming towards me. It is so dreamy. It seems as if I am apart from this world where people worry so much and talk back about each other. It just seems that life and death is nothing more then a dream. It is so so beautiful that it just seems as if the bright stars are gleaming in front of my very eyes.
<CO>If you have the time I really hope that you can go to the museum or read a book about van Gogh and know how much he loved art.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,Lots of good details here but still a little too general.

"969&<EV>You know that there is always a bad thing and a good thing every day.</EV> There is nothing like a perfect day for human beings. Even if you had the best birthday party ever, there might be some other problems that you might be suffering from inside your mind. <TR>However,</TR> today I suffered from a lot more bad things than good things. <TR>First,</TR> <TR>because</TR> I did not finish my math homework, my mother was very, very angry at me.
<TR>Because of this,</TR> my morning was not a good morning but a bad morning.
Then came the big one that almost spoiled all of today's little good things. I live in a tall apartment so it is very important for me to use the elevator. <TR>But</TR> I had to wait 7 minutes for the elevator. It kept going to 20th floor and the 14th floor, and would go back and forth from the 20th floor and 14th floor. <TR>At last after waiting 7 minutes,</TR> I entered the elevator full of people. When I got in, it looked as if it will just burst out because there were so many people on it. <TR>But</TR> this was not all. The elevator stopped at every floor, starting from the twelfth to the first floor. It was such a horrible time and everyone in the elevator was muttering things like ""Why is the elevator like this"" or perhaps some other words that did not seem polite. <TR>So</TR> there I was. In the middle of crowed people muttering something under their breath. I felt so miserable. I was already five minutes late to my math academy class. <TR>And</TR> I was so upset by it, I almost slid down the slippery ice, which might have caused me more problems.
The last one came just then. When I arrived at my math class and listened to my teacher explaining, I felt so tired that I was just going to fall asleep. <TR>Then,</TR> my teacher gave my classmates and me tons of math problems to solve plus so much homework that it made me dizzy just by looking at it.
<TR>Now,</TR> as I am typing these very words, I am feeling more and more miserable. <CO>Not only because of the problems I faced today, <TR>but</TR> also because of the terrible headache that just hit me right now.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,Good paragraph form and transitions.,//
"970&<EV>I was really looking foward to seeing this soap opera.</EV> I did not have an opportunity to watch it when it was on TV because of two reasons. I had a big test when it was on, and since it was on cable TV, I could not watch it at the right time. (My television does not have any cable TV channels.) <TR>So</TR> I watched all of them at my grandparents' house. It took me two days to watch it all.
The story is not very simple. It is a love story, <TR>but</TR> a type that I have never seen before. The main characters are Yunjay and Siwon. They have been friends since childhood. Their parents were friends too. <TR>But</TR> Yunjay's parents are dead because of an accident. So Siwon's parents take Care of Yunjay and his brother. They grow to love each other, but there are so many things waiting ahead for them.
I really loved this story. There is a surprise ending, and I was very surprised by it. <TR>Also,</TR> when I noticed that another friend of Siwon, called Junhi, was gay and loved Yunjay, I was very surprised. I was surprised not only because he was gay, <TR>but</TR> because Siwon was understanding and remained friends with him.
Although I really liked this soap opera, I wondered: Why do so many people like this soap opera so much? Then I found some reasons that made sense to me. The reason why is because it makes people think of their past. We are now living in a digital world. Everything changes so quickly. <TR>But in the show,</TR> it goes back 15 years in the characters' lives. <TR>For older generations,</TR> seeing Siwon's mother and father must make them think of their lives as mothers and fathers of teenagers. It makes them think of the old cell phones they were using, and what shows they watched. Though life in our country was very hard because of IMF, they must have some good memories about those times. And this show made them think about it. <TR>For the people in their late 20's and early 30's,</TR> it made them think of their lives as teenagers. <TR>In the show,</TR> there are many TV stars they once liked as teenagers, in shows such as H.O.T and Jack's Kiss. <TR>Also,</TR> things in the show, such as PePe and damagochi made them think about how they used to play with friends.
<TR>And for us,</TR> who are teenagers now, it makes us think about how it would be to live back then, when there were no smartphones and computers that were very slow.
<TR>However,</TR> I liked this show mostly because Seo In Kuk, who acted as Yun jay, was so handsome. <CO>It made me become a fan of his. I will write some other interesting things next week.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,Good reflection on why people like soap operas It shows an intelligent thought process and it makes this easier to read.

"971&<EV>I was inside the plane at sunrise.</EV> My father booked the ticket, so that we can arrive at my grandmother's house before lunch. <TR>So</TR> all of my family members woke up around 5 o'clock. Although I was very sleepy, I followed my parents to catch a taxi near the bus stop. The airport is not really far from my house. It just took about 20 minutes to arrive there. It is good to live near the airport because whenever I have time, I can go shopping at the malls near the airport with my friends. <TR>Anyway, </TR>our family sat in the airplane seats for 45 minutes. All of us slept until we arrived to Kimhye (it is near Busan) airport. When we arrived, my grandfather and grandmother on my father's side were waiting for us inside their car. <TR>After saying our hellos and some shaking of hands,</TR> we finally settled in and rode in the car for about one hour. We were not heading for their house but were heading for my grandparent's house on my mother's side. We were planning to stay there for one night. <TR>As soon as we arrived,</TR> we ate breakfast. My grandmother's food is always very delicious. I think it is because she only uses good ingredients to make food and also because of her secret recipe. My grandfather is a rock collector. Even though he lives in an apartment, there are hundreds of rocks placed neatly inside the glass. He likes to water his plants and take care of his garden too. There is a miniature garden inside his apartment. There are miniature trees. <TR>And</TR> my favorite tree is the one that looks like a tree that is at least a hundred or more years old. Since my grandparent's apartment is a very sunny place, all the plants grow well. My grandparent's farm is quite near their apartment. We have to ride in the car for 30 minutes. There are lot of plants growing there. Every summer my cousins and Is visit their farm and help them water their plants. Although there are no animals at the farm, it is quite easy to spot a frog or a fish in the nearby river. There are so many plants growing there. Most of them are edible. My grandfather likes to carve woods. <TR>So,</TR> there are Jangsengs that he carved standing in the farm entrance. <TR>But</TR> because it is winter now, I could not visit there.
We decided to stay inside the house and watch TV and talk to each other. <TR>After</TR> some hours I got bored of what the adults were talking about. <TR>So,</TR> I sneaked inside the room where there were old albums. While I was going through the pile of albums, I found a child who looked very similar to me. It looked as if I was inside the old picture. <TR>However,</TR> I soon found that it was my mom who was inside the picture. She looked very pretty in the pink skirt that she were wearing. I even saw my grandparent's black and white wedding picture. It was ""Incantada (that means charming in Spanish)!""
You know that sometimes it is very hard to think about what our parents or grandparents looked like when they were young. <TR>But</TR> that will be solved once you see the albums or diary of your parents. It is quite fun to see them dressed in the old fashioned clothes.

"972&<EV>This movie was so impressive in scientific ways. <TR>Today,</TR> I will write a review about this movie.*</EV>
This movie is a great movie with imagination and action combined together. There were parts where the story was not quite connected, but still it was a good movie.
What I thought was special about this movie were the things that appeared in the movie.
The cell phone that was inside the hand was the best. We can use it to connect to each other by showing our faces when you put your hand onto a glass. <TR>To call someone,</TR> the light comes out from your hand and you can see the numbers. <TR>If you press it,</TR> you can connect to another person. I think this is a very unique style for a cell phone. It makes me think that maybe engineers who work at Apple or Samsung could develop this kind of cell phone in the future. I will be the first one to buy this cell phone if they really make it.
<TR>Also,</TR> the huge elevator that goes through the core was spectacular. There was no gravity so you can fly.
There was also a mask that can change your face. If you place it on your neck, it will change your face into someone else you want to be. I think they made it possible by developing hologram skills. <TR>By using the light,</TR> it might be possible to cover your face with another image to make a mask like this possible.

"973&<EV>Ghosts are always a mystery for human beings.</EV> A ghost is not something that we normally see. Someone who has seen a ghost is going to believe that it exists, <TR>but</TR> someone who has not seen it, will be afraid of it or just not believe in it.
<TR>Well,</TR> today, I am going to write about the topic of ghosts. I don't think it is funny to tell somebody ghost stories. <TR>But</TR> the reason I am writing about ghost is <TR>because</TR> I want to tell you about my idea about ghosts.
<TR>First,</TR> I searched the website and found out that a ghost is a person's soul. (<TR>However,</TR> this may not really be a correct answer to you so I will write what I think at the end of this diary.)
Many people say that they have seen ghosts. Maybe it was your cousin or teacher or many others. They may have seen it for real but most of them are just making up stories. They may say to you that they have seen a ghost standing in the dark looking at them. <TR>And</TR> you may either think, ""<TR>Well,</TR> I don't believe it,"" or ""Oh it is really scary. It might be real."" <TR>But</TR> your mother will simply say that it does not exist. And you may not know, whether to believe your mom or the people who say that they have seen ghosts.
If you read a book about ghosts, you will find that there are many types of ghosts. I will tell you about some of the different kinds of ghosts. <TR>First,</TR> there are ghosts which are in a particular place and do not have any resentment towards something. These ghosts may be seen by the people who comes to that place, whether for shelter or to live. But these types of ghosts cannot go to other places because they are just born (I don't know whether ghosts are born but whatever) to live only in that place. <TR>Second,</TR> there are ghosts who have resentment towards people because they were killed by somebody or for some other reason. People who come to the place where they are living become the target. Even if the target moves to another place, the ghosts can keep following them in some way such as going inside their dolls, stick, notebook or some other object. <TR>Third,</TR> there are ghosts that came to this world because of some people who want to use them. They are just souls that are controlled by the people who called them. <TR>Fourth,</TR> there are fairies who are the guardians of a particular land or plants. There are some other types of ghosts, but these are the ghosts that are most commonly seen or felt.
<TR>Now,</TR> I will tell you my idea about ghosts. By searching about ghosts, I found the answer that I really wanted. It was written in the book called ""Ghost Dictionary."" Ghosts are minds. Everything in the world has a mind and the minds that are visible are ghosts. There are many different minds. There are minds that contain resentment towards something. There are minds that love their country. There are minds that think of their family members. There are minds of animals that cannot speak. The mind has the biggest power in the world. It is our minds that occur in our world and the world which dead people go. <CO>It is in our minds that scary and peaceful things occur. It is our minds that become animals and humans. It is all in our minds.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Good but doesn't stay on task. Is it a diary about general ghost information or the author's opinions on ghosts? Good paragraph form.,//
"974&Do you know any gay couples? <EV><TR>Well,</TR> I don't. <TR>But</TR> since I am very interested in this topic, I will write my opinion about it in this diary.</EV>
<TR>Actually,</TR> before I write about gay couples or gay marriage, I would first like to say that there is no law in Korea about gay marriage. What that means is that it is not illegal to have a marriage or other legal rights because there is no law about it.
<TR>Actually,</TR> I agree about allowing gay couples to marry and adopt children.
Just because there is a small amount of people who are gay and normally people marry someone of a different gender, it does not mean that they are strange or odd. They are also couples too. If they are a couple and want to marry, I think they should be able to.
<TR>Also,</TR> I think that it should be legal for them to adopt a child.
If they adopt a child, they can give the same amount of love or even more to children they adopt in comparison to other couples. <TR>For example</TR> in America, most gay couples are wealthier than other couples their age. I am not saying that only money is needed to raise a child. <TR>But,</TR> because they are wealthier than other people, they will be able to provide the adopted children with a much better environment and education.
We should all be treated equally under the law.
<TR>However,</TR> people who do not agree with me will say things like this: ""Do you want to grow up in a family with two fathers and not a mother? How about two mothers and not a father?"" I thought about this question and found a perfect answer (at least for me). Why don't you ask the orphans? If a gay couple wants to adopt a child, they can ask the child's opinion first. <TR>And</TR> if the child wants to live with them, they can adopt the child. <TR>But</TR> the child should be at least over 12 because before that age, they might not know what it means to be gay. <TR>And</TR> there is a possibility that they might not be able to make a good judgement for themselves.
<CO>I think I will end my diary here, <TR>but</TR> maybe by reading my diary, you can think of this issue too.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,Good transitions at the beginnings of the paragraphs. Thoughtful and filled with many intelligent musings on the subject. Stays on topic.,//
"975&<EV><TR>Today, my mother, my younger brother, and I baked some pizza.</EV> It was lunchtime, and mother suggested making a pizza. <TR>Of course</TR> we all agreed. <TR>However,</TR> the pizza that we baked was not an ordinary pizza. My mother named it pocket pizza, b<TR>ecause</TR> it is very small, like a muffin.
I will tell you the recipe. <TR>First,</TR> slice ham, peppers, mushrooms, onion, carrots, and other vegetables and fry it. Then put a dumpling skin inside the muffin tray. Make it look like a wiggly flower. Put tomato sauce inside the dumpling skin. Spread it using a teaspoon. <TR>After that,</TR> put the fried vegetables on top of the the tomato sauce. <TR>Finally,</TR> put pizza cheese on the top of the pocket pizza.

"976&Good news! <EV>I became the mother of a sea monkey!</EV> Sea monkeys are little shrimps that live in Americas salt lakes. I went to the market to buy some things for my younger brother and I found this sea monkey breeding kit, which I bought immediately.
I opened the box and read the instructions. I opened the small plastic capsule where the eggs were. They were pure white in color and looked like salt. I wondered how they could grow into a fully-grown shrimp. <Tr>Anyway,</Tr> I placed everything into a jar and mixed it with some warm water. It should be over 20 degrees Celsius. <TR>Since it's winter,</TR> I kept it warm by placing the jar inside a bucket of warm water.

"979&<EV><TR>Yesterday,</TR> my grandmother sent me some boxes of kimchi and I got it today. It was in front of my house door. When my mother was back from work, we opened the box and tried some kimchi. It was so, so, so, so delicious! I was really thankful to my grandmother.
Have you ever eaten fresh kimchi with rice or some meat? It is so delicious that it will make you eat until your mouth is burning.
There are many kinds of kimchi. <TR>For example</TR> there is white kimchi, or dongchimi. Some of them are made in spring. Some of them are made in the summer, or fall. We make kimchi in ever season.
<TR>However,</TR> the red kimchi made from of cabbage, which is made in winter, is my favorite. The region it was made in makes the taste of the kimchi different. <TR>For example,</TR> my grandmother lives near Busan. Unlike many of those who buy jeotgal in markets, she makes it by herself. She uses anchovy jeotgal, pepper, salt, cabbage and many other vegetables when she makes kimchi. She puts it in a jar after it is finished. <TR>In other regions,</TR> they make it differently. <TR>But</TR> you can find out whether it was made in the upper or lower regions just by trying it. When you eat kimchi from the upper regions, it is usually not very salty and light. It is because the upper regions are colder than the other parts. When it is cold, the food does not really decompose. Think of it this way. When you put the food in the refrigerator, it does not really decompose.
In the lower regions, the weather is warmer than the upper regions. They put a lot of salty things, like salt, jeotgal and many other things that taste salty. This is because food goes bad more easily in the lower regions.
There are some particular regions near the sea that make kimchi with cabbage and sliced fish, or clams.
<CO><TR>But,</TR> I want to say that kimchi is delicious. Some of your grandparents might send kimchi to you or maybe your mother makes it. Be thankful to them.

"980&I have never thought about how much a mother can do for her own child.
<TR>For example,</TR> ever since last week, my mother and I have both been very tired. It is because my mother stayed up late with me. When I am studying until late night, my mother stays up with me and reads books. I am so thankful.
<EV><TR>Today,</TR> I want to share with you some stories that how strong a mother's love towards her children can be.</EV>
I saw in the news that a mother called Kera Cobella had given up her life to save her child. She could not give birth to two of her babies because they died in her womb. Then she became pregnant with her third baby and was so happy about it. <TR>But</TR> she did not realize that she had cancer. <TR>After some time,</TR> before she gave birth to her baby, she found out that she had cancer. Doctors said that she should give up her baby, get surgery, and take medicine, but she did not. She gave birth to the baby. By then she had cancer all over her body, and lost sigh in one of her eyest. She died this summer. Her husband said that when the baby grows up, he will tell him about his mother's brave choice. At her funeral hundreds of people came and cried for her.
This story made me think deeply about how much mother can love a child. I think if I was in a situation like that, I would not give birth to my baby and worry about myself. <TR>Of course</TR> I will be sorry for my baby but I think I will live more eagerly for my baby who saved my life.
<TR>Second,</TR> there is also your own mother who is sitting beside you or maybe working hard at her workplace. <TR>Sometimes,</TR> when you are angry at your mother, try to understand her.

"981&Have you ever thought how wonderful a human voice can be?
I have found out how diverse and wonderful the human voice can be, just today. Do you know the group called Naturally 7? <EV>It is an R&B group.</EV> You better search for them and hear their songs. They sing songs, but what really surprised me is that they are like ""human instruments"". They make instrument sounds without using any instruments at all. They make instrument sounds using their whole body. I personally liked Jamal Reed and Hops. Jamal Reed is not in the group any more, but he has one of the most wonderful voices I have ever heard. He can make electric guitar sounds without using any instruments. It was simply really amazing. There were others in the group who can do make sounds like a harmonica, trumpet, and all sort of other instruments. I liked Hops too. He sounded like contrabass saxophone or cello. He said before he started to sing,""How's everybody doing tonight?"" <TR>and</TR> I was so surprised by his deep, deep dark chocolate-like voice. It was very low but very sweet.

For poise, 
walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone.
People, even more than things, 
have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed, 
and redeemed; never throw out anyone.
<TR>Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, 
you will find one at the end of each of your arms. 
<TR>As you grow older,</TR> you will discover that you have two hands; 
one for helping yourself, and the other for helping others. 

<EV>These were the words of Audrey Hepburn.</EV> I liked the part where she said, ""<TR>As you grow older,</TR> you will discover that you have two hands; one for helping yourself, and the other for helping others."" The reason I wrote Audrey Hepburn's poem is because I want to talk about doing something for others.

<TR>Today,</TR> when I attended my academy class after school, my teacher told me the story about Mother Teresa's house for the dying. She went there <TR>because</Tr> she wanted to help those who were sick and close to death. She tried to wash the clothes, but they were so dirty that she just vomited the first time. She said she went out immediately, <TR>because</Tr> she could not cope with it. There were mountains of cloths for her to wash and she said she could not handle it. She described the people inside the house, the blood, and the smell. Iwas shocked. I sat at my seat, imagining all the things that she described. She described dirty people, blood dripping out from their body, the smell, and all the other things. <TR>Then suddenly,</TR> I felt a strong emotion. I wanted to go there right away and help those who were lying weakly in their beds. I wanted to help them in any way I could. And I started to research about it.
<TR>One of the reasons</TR> why I was interested in Mother Teresa's house for the dying is because I like India. Many of my friends who are in America are from India. <TR>Also,</TR> I enjoy yoga and like to research about India. It is such an interesting country.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> I read some words from the volunteers who worked at Mother Teresa's house for the dying. All of them said that it was really dirty. <TR>However</TR> all of them said it was one of the most beautiful times they ever had. By washing these patients and feeding them, they said that they felt no worries but only happiness that they could help these people.
<TR>As I researched,</TR> I thought about the things I can do to help these people. <TR>First,</TR> since I cannot go there right now, I will donate my pocket money to the children in Africa and help them go to school. <TR>Also,</TR> I plan to go there when I become an adult. <TR>Then,</TR> I read the sentence that said, ""People liked my massage."" YES!!! I have a very strong finger and when I massage my grandmother or my mother, they always say that they feel really good when I massage them. I think I will be able to massage the patient in the house. I really want to go there. <CO>As Mother Teresa did, I will feed those people and love them as if they are my family. I will go there as soon as I go to the university. Until that time comes, I will still think of another way to help others.</CO>

What I want to tell you today is about the house that I want to live in. I want to live in a very small wood house. I already found some pictures of it. It has two floors. <TR>On the first floor,</TR> there is a bathroom with a very small bathtub, sink, and a toilet. <TR>Also</TR> there is a small kitchen. There would be a box-sized refrigerator, tiny sink, one gas stove with a box-like oven below it, some rooms for storing dishes, and a table for one person.
<TR>On the second floor,</TR> there will be some books, a computer, and my bed. I think it will be very fun to live in that house because it is simple and would be very easy to concentrate in it. The biggest advantage of living in that house is that it takes only a small amount of money to build that house. My house is a box-like structure and looks like a big wooden box when you look at it from the outside. <TR>But</TR> I want it to be simple as possible. When you buy a big house, it will cost you a lot of money and it takes a lot of effort to clean up your house every day. Sometimes you will feel tired of cleaning your house.
<TR>As soon as I become an adult,</TR> I will build this house straight away.

"984&<EV>Yesterday was my friend's birthday.</EV> <TR>It was so,</TR> so much fun. <TR>The day before yesterday,</TR> I went to the beauty shop with my mother to buy a present for my friend. It was a cleansing oil, which makes the pores of your nose large so the blackheads can go out. It is made with ashes of volcano.
<TR>Yesterday when I woke up,</TR> I finished my math homework, and dressed up to meet my friends. My best friend and I celebrated her birthday. She got two presents, one from me and another one from my best friend. My friend gave her a leather diary. It was pink and even though I do not like pink, I still thought it looked beautiful. We went to a fast food restaurant, and ate some hamburgers after my friend saw our presents. <TR>Then,</TR> we went to see a short 4D video. There is a small 4D shop in our town called ""Max Rider."" It is almost like an amusement park squished into one room. We selected 'Space Adventure."" It was very exciting. The door closed, and we wore special glasses to see the 4D screen. There is a big car in the middle of the room that looks like a bumper car that shakes, rattles, and even makes water vapor come out. It was as if we rode a real bumper car and it was running...There was a front seat and back seat, and my friends and I sat in the back seat, which shakes more than the front seat. <TR>When the video started,</TR> snakes came out and hissed in front of my eyes, at least that was what I saw, and there were all kinds of space monsters coming out. It was really thrilling, and scary. We watched ""Goblin World"" too. It was not as scary as ""Space Adventure"" but very speedy and fun.
<TR>After that,</TR> we went to the singing room, and sang for an hour. My neck felt as if it was going to break. <TR>Anyway,</TR> I sang so many songs. <TR>As I sang loudly,</TR> it was as if all my stress just disappeared into the air. You, who is reading my diary, might know that feeling of your stress disappearing as you sing. <TR>After an hour of singing,</TR> we went to the beauty shop to buy some makeup, such as pretty tint, lip balm, mascara, and eye shadow. <TR>Later</TR> when I came back home and told my mother that my friends I bought some makeup tools, my mother was surprised. She said when she was a student, she and her friends did not buy or put on makeup. They thought it was for adults, not for students. <TR>However,</TR> if you are a girl, and you are going to go to middle school, you will definitely learn how to put on makeup by the older students at school, or by your friends. Oh don't say ""I won't!"" because I thought that I wouldn't when I was in elementary school too ^ ^.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> after we bought some makeup, we went straight to the trampoline shop, where we paid money, went in, and bounced until our muscles were burning. It was really fun. When I jumped up high and touched the ceiling, it felt as if I was flying high into the sky. I went straight home after thirty minutes, <TR>because</TR> I felt so tired. We all said our good-byes and headed straight home. It was really a fun day after all. <CO>Now that my birthday is in May, I have to wait until next year to have my birthday party.

"985&Have you ever heard about little mom, or an unmarried mother?
I think if you, whoever is reading my diary, passed your twelfth birthday, you might have heard about it from your mother or from your health teacher at school. <EV><TR>Today,</TR> my best friend and I discussed this topic in school.</EV> My best friend and I went to the library this very morning, and found a book called ""Kissing My Life"". It was about a young girl, who is seventeen, having a baby and being an unmarried mother. She became an unmarried mother by her boyfriend, and had to choose between just having surgery to kill the baby inside her womb, or giving birth to the baby. <TR>And in the end,</TR> she gave birth to the baby and became an unmarried mother.

This is a very important issue. I also researched this problem, and it turns out that in many schools, teachers just pressure the unmarried mothers to get out of their school. I really disagree. Even if it is wrong to have a baby at that age, the school should lead them to the right way, and should not pressure them to give up their studies. Even though they became a young mother and gave birth to a baby, it does not mean they should give up their studies.
<TR>Also,</TR> there is another very serious problem; many people see them as if they are like a prisoner or an animal inside the cage of a zoo. In the newspapers that I researched, people looked at them in a very wrong way, and treated them with a very wrong attitude. <TR>At least,</TR> they should treat the unmarried mothers as humans. Staring at them and pointing their fingers at them is very, very wrong behavior towards them.
<TR>Lastly,</TR> there should be more systems that help unmarried mother. They should be protected. They should be safe and be able to study. <TR>However,</TR> it turns out that there are many unmarried mother in Korea, but very small amount of public shelters for unmarried mothers. They should definitely increase the amount of public shelters.

"986&<EV><TR>ce a week before,</TR> I set plans for my diet. And I am on a diet.</EV>
<TR>Well,</TR> I am not fat at all. I am 160 cm tall, and I weigh 45kg. I am just normal for my age. <TR>But</TR> the reason I decided to diet is because of something other than becoming skinny.
I have a very big secret, and I did not tell anyone, even to my friends. <TR>But</TR> I am going to tell you, who has been reading every single word of my diary, <TR>because</TR> I think you will understand me.
I eat my breakfast just like everyone else does and lunch like everyone else does. <TR>But</TR> the problem is that I become a massive, and sometimes monstrous eater when it comes to dinner. I eat so much that even my family gets surprised. <TR>And after that,</TR> I regret my actions. It is (for sure) a very, very bad action.
Some of you guys might not be able to understand my actions. <TR>But</TR> if you experience that problem yourself, you will understand me. It is a really sad thing that you cannot control yourself.
I think that I should keep on growing, <TR>so</TR> I planned for a diet that is both good for stopping myself from eating too much at dinner, and growing a lot.

This is my plan: 

<TR>First,</TR> I will not eat anything except to drink water after six in the evening. (I am doing well ever since the day I decided my diet. I am eating my dinner before six.)
<TR>Second,</TR> I am going to try to drink at least 600ml of milk a day, which means three cups of milk. (I am keeping up with this well too. I drink one cup in the morning, one cup before lunch, and the last cup just after my dinner.)
<TR>Lastly,</TR> I exercise for one minute a day. I guess you will be surprised by the phrase ""one minute exercising."" It was on the BBC channel, and I was surprised by it too. I learned that you can lose weight by cycling as fast as you can for one minute. <TR>First,</TR> you should cycle for 20 seconds, as fast as you can. <TR>Then,</TR> you rest for five seconds and do it again two more times. It is really effective and it is even better then walking or jogging for one hour!!! (And so far, I think it is pretty effective, because I always catch my breath after this exercise. <TR>Also,</TR> I try to stretch at least three times a week for five minutes.)
I hope this fixes my problems and will let me grow tall as I can.

My family members and I packed our bags. My mom packed some food and toiletries such as shampoo, <TR>and</TR> my brother and I packed our books and DVD player. My father packed the water and other clothes. We were going to the hot spring pool called Spavis.
We went there by car. When we arrived, we headed to a Chinese restaurant. I forgot the name of it, <TR>but</TR> I remember that there were many flies inside. When we entered the restaurant, the food was very good but there were lots of flies that disturbed us while we were eating. When we finished and went back to the parking lot, there were so many flies sitting on our car. I guess the city has a lot of flies, since there were many flies outside the swimming pool too.
We rode our car for about a minute or two, and soon parked in the Spavis parking lot. <TR>Then,</TR> my mother and I changed from our clothes into our swimsuits, and went to the swimming pool. The pool was both inside and outside. They were both very warm. My little brother and I rode the slides. My favorite slide was inside. It was the blue one, which was very, very fast. My mother and my father got a water massage, talked, laughed, and rested. It was such a lovely time. 
<TR>After spending a few hours inside,</TR> we went to the doctor fish zone. We placed our foot and legs inside the
pool where the doctor fish live. My parents and I giggled as the fish ate the dead skin on our feet. It really tickled. <TR>But</TR> no fish went to my little brother because his feet were so clean. I really wanted to buy them and put them in my house, <TR>so</TR> I could put my feet in my bathtub and enjoy.

I am talking about the kind of dream that people have when they sleep. Today I will tell you about what I dreamed about the day before yesterday. It was both the scariest and strangest dream I have ever had in my life.
<TR>As always,</TR> I went to sleep. Then I dreamed about something. It goes like this...

You will all know that I visited the Czech Republic almost a week ago. In my dream, my teacher said to the students while I was not in school that the test will be one month earlier then what she first said. And she never said it again.
I did not know about the change in date until the test came, and since I studied very little, I couldn't really remember anything and I was so, so surprised.
<TR>After the test,</TR> when the grades came out, my teacher saw one of the test sheets, which was mine, and read it. ""You got a 0 in all the subjects!"" she said, pointing to me. Everyone except my friends laughed. My face got red....

And then all of a sudden, I recognized that it was a dream, just a dream, and I was inside of it. It was nothing more then a dream.
And I got up from my bed.

When the weekend ended and I went to school, I told my friends about it.
They all laughed until they cried. Well, I burst into laughter too.
It is now Monday evening and I started thinking about my dream again while I write in this diary.
I still think that it was really scary.

It was very fun and exciting, and I went right after I finished my test.
<TR>And today,</TR> I want to tell you about the very best part of my journey.
It happened when I was visiting Karlovy Vary.
Karlovy Vary is a city famous for its hot springs.
The hot springs are different from ones in other cities because we can drink the water, and it is very good for our body.
There are about twelve different hot springs and the taste of the water is different at each one.
Karlovy Vary is also famous for its special cups, which are made of glass and have a glass straw that looks like a handle.
I bought one that looks like a cat with a long tail.
A surprising event happened after I bought my cup.
I was passing by the shops and looking at various cups.
Then I suddenly heard the song ""Gangnam Style."" 
<SR>I was so happy that I danced to ""Gangnam Style"" with my brother in front of the shop.</SR>

<TR>Today,</TR> the tests ended. I immediately went to the hair salon to get a hair cut, and also to straighten my hair. It took me a very long time to finish my hair. I have a lot of hair, and it is about two or three times thicker than my friends. Because of these reasons, when other people put the perm solution in their hair once, I have to get it in my hair twice. I also asked the hairdresser, to cut my hair very short since it was too heavy for me. I had long hair, but soon my hair was as short as the Egyptians' who lived a long, long time ago.
It took me 5 hours to fix my hair. It was a very hard job because I had to sit up straight the whole time. 
My hair looked really beautiful at the end.
It was worth it.

<TR>After that,</TR> I finished my homework and ate dinner.
<TR>When I finished my dinner,</TR> I went to the market with my family and bought a doll. It is almost like a pillow. It looks like a small blue monster. When I saw it, I thought that it was cute and I bought it. When I was back at home, I tried to think of its name. Just before I started writing this diary entry, I named it. It is SmaSma.

I usually ride a bike or walk there.

I shouted, ""OH MY GOD!!!""

Someone stold my seat.
<TR>So</TR> I had no choice but to push my bike all the way up to my house, which is quite far.

While I was pushing my bike, my bike without a seat, I imagined the story of a person who stole my seat.
I imagined a boy who is older then me, feeling guilty while taking out my bicycle's seat. I also imagined a thief, a thief who is on the move while wearing a black mask. I also imagined an old man or a young woman.

Even though I am not sure what happened to my seat, it was sad that someone stole it and I have to buy a new one.

"992&Dear Diary,
What our ancestors said was true.
<EV>THE ENEMY TURNS UP AT THE WRONG PLACE.</EV>
That is exactly what happened today.
<TR>In our middle school,</TR> we trade seats twice a month. That's once every two weeks.
We sometimes just sit where our teacher tells us to, and other times, we pick number cards and sit in the place that matches the number.
<TR>As I always have before,</TR> I stood in line. I picked up the card that had 25 on it. It was a good seat for seeing the teacher. It was in the second row from the front.
<TR>However,</TR> after all the people picked their numbers and went to their seats, I suddenly let out a scream.
""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!""

There is a girl in my school who I had a fight with.
<TR>At one time,</TR> we were best friends and went everywhere together.
<TR>However</TR> we have become enemies since the fight.
<TR>At first</TR> I hated her so much that I really wanted to do something bad to her.
Then I just tried not to care about her.
I ignored her.

My bad feelings disappeared and I felt as calm as a lake.
Even if she did something to me, I did not care.
I realized I have other friends, and I just became good friends with another girl.

<TR>But</TR> I still feel uncomfortable around her.

It was that girl who sat next to me.

"993&<EV>Today I borrowed a book called ""Kira-Kira"" from the library. It is an English book and I liked it very much.</EV>

""Lira-Kira"" is about a young girl named Katie Takeshima and her sister Lynn.

Kira-Kira means glittering in Japan, at least that's what Lynn said to Katie.
Katie's family was very poor. They lived back in 1950. Katie's father worked in a large factory and her mother also worked in a similar factory as her father. But even though it was a difficult time, the family was always happy. <TR>However</TR> after some years pass, Lynn become ill and faces death. The whole family is filled with sadness. Only Katie believes that Lynn will get better and they will happily live together in California where Lynn and Katie always dreamed of living. Katie has hope that all the things will get better. Lynn had always taught Katie that her life will be Kira-Kira.
Although this story has a very sad ending, I think this story is very beautiful. I also started to like the word Kira-Kira was able to see everything like Kira-Kira. If you see everything as happiness and hope, the world will look different. The world will look more beautiful than ever. <TR>Everything will look so lovely</TR>, even your bad teacher or your annoying brother. I learned to understand everybody and their own thoughts and also learned how to change my own thought to make a better one than before.

This book taught me something very important. This book was not a fantasy book or a comic book. It absolutely did not make me beam or smile.

<TR>But</TR> by reading this book and seeing the life of Katie, I was filled with hope and happiness. I became thankful that I was born, thankful for living in my own home with my own family, thankful that I have a dream and a future. Everything became like Kira-Kira after I read this book.

Since it was time for supper after I finished this book, I went to the living room and had a delicious dinner. I was thankful for everything. I was thankful to my mother who cooked this delicious dinner. I am really thankfull to this book, ""Kira-Kira."" It changed my attitude towards my own life and towards the world!

Sam spun the wheel and I think he was lucky because he got 850 tickets. It was awesome. <TR>After</TR> we were all done with playing games, we went to the store. We had a total of 2088 tickets. I bought a talking alarm clock, and Sam bought some candy and a pen. It was really fun.

"998&<EV>,TR>Today</TR> I went to play laser tag with my family, and also including my host family.</EV> We went to Jaegerz which is a place for paintball and laser tag. Laser tag is a really fun game. <TR>So first,</TR> you get your equipment to play laser tag. There is a laser gun, and a vest that shows your score, and where to shoot. <TR>After</TR> we were all equipped we went inside to a dark room. During the first round it was boys against girls. My host brother Sam and I were on the green team and the girls were on the blue team. It was two against three. Of course we were the two on the team. <TR>After we were all ready the music starts,</TR> and I started to reload and ran to the blue base. I started shooting at their base because you get lots of points by shooting their base.
In the first round the green team won, <TR>but</TR> in the second round my host brother Sam's gun was not working, <TR>so</TR> it was one against three. I had a really hard time defending and attacking at the same time. <TR>After</TR> we were done with the second round everyone was sweating like we had just finished running a marathon. We had some soda and water, then at about 2:40 some other people came in, so we had to play with them. <TR>Now</TR> the girls and the boys were both on the green team and the other people were on the blue team. Our strategy was that we would have one person stay on the base to protect it, two people as snipers to get people on the stairs, while my brother Sam and I would do the main assualt. We played another two rounds and we beat them both and I got the highest score overall for both games. <CO>It was a lot of fun. I wish we could come to Jaegerz again.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,3,::,4,::,Where is the emotional interest? No self-reflection.,//
"999&<EV><TR>Yesterday</TR> I went to the Schlitterbahn water park with my host family and my family.</EV> Schlitterbahn water park is one of the largest water park companies in the United States. They have three water parks in Texas and one water park in Kansas City. Right now the biggest water park in the United States is the Schlitterbahn water park that's in Texas, but they say that in about six years the Kansas CitySchlitterbahn water park will be the largest water park in the whole North America, <TR>but</TR> I still think that Aquatica which I went to two years ago is the best, because it has the scariest rides. Schlitterbahn has also lots of fun rides but they were not as fun as the ones in Aquatica. Although I did think that the rapids and waves at Schlitterbahn were the best in the whole country, because the rapids go all the way around the park. <TR>So</TR> we didn't have to walk on the hot surface and we could just relax and wait until we reached our destination. What I liked the most about the waves was that we didn't have to ride on a tube, <TR>but</TR> we could just go to the wave river without a tube, which is way better than staying on a tube. There was another thing that I really liked. It was a surfing ride. This ride is the only surfing ride in all of Kansas City. It was really fast and really fun. At the water park we ate some food, because we were getting really hungry. The food was amazing. I ate a foot long hot dog and it was really a foot long. Usually even if they say it's a foot long hot dog, it's really not a foot long or it's smaller, but the one I had at Schlitterbahn was really a foot long and it was really delicious. The food at Schlitterbahn was really delicious. <CO>I think they have the best water park food. Schlitterbahn water park was a blast for us and we had lots of fun together. I still thank my host mom for this.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Where is the emotional interest? No self-reflection.,//
"1000&<EV>The day before yesterday my host brother and I went to a football camp.</EV> It's not like soccer. It's American football. It involves tackling and passing with your hands. It is really fun. I used to play it every time I was in America. <TR>Anyway,</TR> we had about 2 weeks of camp. <>TR>During the first week,</TR> I went for the quarterback position. The quarterback is the guy who is usually at the center of the game. He passes to the receivers and throws the ball to the running backs. So it's the hardest job in the NFL, and also the highest paid job in the NFL. The camp starts at 8:30 and ends at about 12. We practiced running first and then we split up into groups by position like quarterbacks, running backs, and receivers. In the quarterback group we practiced passing, did some passing and pitching drills, and then we grouped up with the receivers and running backs to do drills with them. It was really fun and hard. When we were all done we started doing 3 on 3 and 7 on 7 drills. We made a team and had to do a punt, return, pass, score, and stuff like that. I was really good at it. During the second week I played the quarterback again, but this time we also practiced defense. In the first week it was a quarterback and receiver camp, but in the second week it was all combined, so there weren't a lot of people, which was a good thing. We got more chances to play. <TR>Of course</TR> we practiced running at first, <TR>and</TR> then all of the kids gathered around to listen to the coach, <TR>because</Tr> defense is harder to play than offense. Then they showed us how to punt return, punt snap, punt block, fumble recovery, and etc. I played the quarterback again and when playing defense I was the cornerback/safety. Except when playing defense, all the stuff was pretty much the same. We divided into the quarterback, running back, and receiver positions again. Then we practiced pretty much the same thing that we did during the first week, so it was really easy for me. When we played 3 on 3 and 7 on 7 I was usually blocking or playing the position of receiver. I was actually doing really well even though I wasn't really fast because I beat out one of the fastest kids that was at the camp, <TR>so</TR> when I got my record sheet I had a best score on making big plays and acceleration, and also really good scores for throwing and arm strength. I think that football camp was really fun. <CO>I had a good time with my host brother, <TR>and also</TR> had a really good time myself. I think that this football camp will be one of my best memories in America.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,Where is the emotional interest? No self-reflection.,//
"1001&<EV>Last week I went fishing with my host dad and my host brother in America.</EV> We went to the Truman Lake that's in Kansas City. Truman Lake is a very popular spot for fishing, <TR>because</TR> it has lots of crappie and white bass. The boat that we used was called the Ranger. It is used for lake fishing, and our fishing helper was Mr. Blake who is really good at fishing. <TR>On the first day</TR> we caught about 40 fishes. We caught a lot of crappies and some white basses.
It was really late when we were done fishing on the first day, <TR>so</TR> we had dinner really late that day. We stayed at Park Fled Inn. It was a motel, <TR>but</TR> it's services were really good like a hotel's. It even had breakfast downstairs in the morning. <TR>Our first day ended like that,</TR> and the next day we went to the same lake on the same boat with the same helper.
We caught about 50 fishes that day. The limit for the amount of fish you can catch is 50. It was really cool that we were able to reach the limit. That's a lot of fish! The best thing of all was catching a catfish. A catfish is called meggie in Korean. I didn't catch it, but my host brother did. It was really cool to see a catfish so close. <CO>Our fishing trip was great.

Our flight will leave Korea at 5 P.M, so I have to miss two classes in school. 
My flight will arrive in Detroit, so I have to get on a diffrent plane to go to Kansas City. My host family will be waiting at the Kansas City airport. I think I can already imagine the faces of my host family and my family when they meet. 
We have a lot of plans for things to do when we get there. <TR>First,</TR> I will be meeting my friends and then we will go play in the pool.

"1003&<EV>I watched Amazing Spiderman yesterday.</EV> Amazing Spider man was really strange, <TR>because</TR> there were a lot of changes from the other Spiderman movies.

Although it had a lot of changes I think that this movie is best Spiderman movie so far. <TR>In the Amazing Spiderman</TR>, Spiderman doesn't shoots spider webs from his hands anymore, he shoots them with the watch he mad. The strangest part of he movie was that the bully who bullied him became friends with Spiderman. The thing that I liked in the Amazing Spiderman is that they mentioned Spiderman's mother and father. <TR>Before</TR> they didn't say anything about Spiderman's parents, <TR>so</TR> I was always curious about that. The Amazing Spiderman also had a different villain. This villian is a reptile, <TR>and</TR> he is Spiderman's father's friend. Spiderman helped him with his new project and they finally figured out about how to make hybrids. The villain didn't have a arm, so he did an experiment on himself so that his arm could grow back. <TR>But</TR> he turned into a reptile monster instead. <TR>So</TR> Spiderman thinks that it's his fault that the doctor turn into a giant reptile, so he asks his girlfriend to make a vaccine to save the doctor.

It is written by a Japanese writer. I think he writes really good books. I'm in the writing club and this books helps me a lot. 
I think I'm actually becoming better at writing, <TR>because</TR> my writing teacher says I improved a lot. I hope that the writing club doesn't close next semester, <TR>because</TR> the teacher says it might have to close if there aren't a lot of people who sign up. I just hope it won't.
<TR>Anyways</TR> ""Logical Thinking"" also helps adults too. <TR>Well</TR> actually this book is for adults, <TR>but</TR> I thought it could help me too so that's why I'm reading it. It teaches you about skills on how to talk to your boss or someone in management. Since the book is for adults it has some really difficult words in it, so sometimes I have a problem while reading it.

My mom gives us money depending on how many sections we did and how well we cleaned.
I don't get pocket money, so if I want to buy something I have to earn it.
I think it's a really good idea to get money for doing something.
It will help us a lot even we grow up. 
<TR>Today</TR> I cleaned all my sections and even the living room, so I'm asking my mom for some extra money. We can't really clean every Sunday, <TR>because</TR> sometimes one or two of our family members have something else to do.

I wasn't really suprised, because our team has really good players.
I was the point guard for the team, and I scored many points and had many assists.
The championship game was really fun, because we gave the other team a five point lead before
we even started the game. It's because we were better than them. 
We gave them other handicaps and helped them out by not calling a lot of fouls on them.
One of our players actually got injured, because they hit his eyes with the ball and he was
wearing glasses.
Even though we had a hard time playing the game, we still won.
I am really happy that I've won my first championship, and I hope that

"1019&<EV>Going to America was one of the best experiences of my life.</EV>

I'll tell you guys more about exactly what I did there and why it was one of the best experiences of my life.

<TR>On August 14th,</TR> I first arrived in America.

Everything was so different from Korea and I didn't really have any friends or families there, because I

was the only Korean who was there.

I met my host family who looked really nice and kind.

I went to their house where I would stay to unpack and go to sleep, since it was 2 am. 

I started getting friendly with my host family and talked to them about Korea and their country, the USA.

When I talked to them I could tell right away that they are nice people.

The next morning I started to meet my friends and neighbors. All of them were nice to me

and they asked a lot of things about my country and told me a lot about their country.

I started to like football after I started going to school and getting closer with my friends.

I started going to football games and even played a little. 

<TR>Anyways,</TR> I would like to tell my Little Fox friends about my experiences in Florida and New York.

<TR>In October</TR> I went to Florida for the first time.

We went to Palm Beach and stayed at the Palm Beach resort.

We went fishing and swimming, and we also ate a lot of delicious foods.

I hope I can go back to Florida when I go to the USA again to see my host family this summer.

Florida was one of the best place in the USA that I went to.

There was a another place that I went to in the USA. I think you guys can guess it

right away! It's where the Statue of Liberty is, New York!

<TR>In New York I walked,</TR> I think about 10 miles per day.

I was so tired everyday that I actually went to sleep at 8 pm and sleep until 10 am every day like a baby.

<TR>Well</TR> I saw and experienced a lot of things, like riding in a New York city taxi, going to the top of the Empire State building.

and eating a New York city hot dog. It was so delicious.

<TR>After going to New York,</TR> I went to another place Florida again, but this time I went to Orlando.

If you like Orlando Magic, a famous basketball team, you'll probably know where Orlando is.

Orlando is not just famous for basketball, but it's also popular for Disney World, Aquatica, and Sea World.

All three of these places were awesome, but I think the best place was Aquatica.

Disney World was good, but there were too many people so we really couldn't ride a lot of the rides. It was a different story at Aquatica. 

We went to Aquatica early in the morning, so we could ride a lot of the rides there.

We rode really fun rides like the Oka Maka wich looks like a giant badminton ball,

and toilet twisters which sucks us like a toilet.

It was a lot of fun there.

<TR>Finally,</TR> there is Sea World.

<TR>In Sea World,</TR> there are a lot of shows, like a dolphin show, seal show, and other things.

<CO>I hope I can go to America again if there is a chance, because it was one of the best

things that I experienced and would never forget.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,"Good reflections on traveling to a new country. However, spacing between the lines is not neeed - only start a new line if you are starting a new paragraph.",//
"1020&<EV>End of summer vacation</EV>

Sunday, August 21st, 2011.
Sunny, cool wind is blowing, the weather is good.

I bought a new MP3 player with my own money.
I was a little sorry for spending my money, but my new MP3 is good.
Its design is good, the sound is good, and other stuff looks look pretty good, too. I downloaded some songs yesterday.
I'm happy listening to songs with my new MP3.
I bought a book, too.
It's the next book in a series that I started reading almost 5 months ago when I was reading other English books.
I considered whether or not to buy the next book in the series or just read other books.
(In my experience, series novel often become boring during the second or third book. <TR>So,</TR> I was thinking that the second book could be different from the first book.)
<TR>But,</TR> I decided to buy the next book in the series.
The first book was thrilling, funny, and it was easy to read.
<TR>So,</TR> I though that perhaps the second book could be fun to read, too.
When I bought it, I found that the pictures were quite different from the ones in the first book.
I like the first book's pictures better than the second book's pictures.
The protagonists looked more charming in the first book's pictures.
In the second book's pictures, Reynie looks too ugly, and seems like he has a bad personality.
(Even though he's really nice in the book.)
<TR>But,</TR> I'm looking forward to reading the story.
I read only a few pages, but I think it'll be exciting.
The first book's story was about 4 children who have special abilities and work together to try and save people from Mr. Curtain's evil plan of brainwashing, and ruling the whole world. I liked Katie the best out of the 4 children. She's a really cool character. I wonder how its author created such funny characters.
The opposite of Mr. Benedict is Mr. Curtain. They were twins that have been separated for a long time. <TR>So</TR> they look the same and share the same disease but are opposite in personality and character. They are very interesting.
<TR>Oh,</TR> I wish I had bought the second book earlier.
<TR>Today</TR> is the end of summer vacation, and I'll go back to school tomorrow.
I'll have less time to read books.
<CO>It's very sad news for me.
Hmm....... I have to go and study math, or read books.

A cicada is singing. It sounds miserable.
The sky is filled with clouds.

<EV>Today was my birthday.</EV>
We (my family and I) celebrated it with cheesecake and ice cream which my mother bought at Baskin Robbins. <TR>And</TR> we ate pizza for lunch, too.
Everything was delicious.
<TR>Today,</TR> I'll write about myself.
I thought about myself for a few days <TR>because</TR> I have to write about my dream for homework.
What is my dream? My dream is to be a writer, <TR>and</TR> a middle school teacher.
I have many places I want to visit, many things I want to learn, <TR>and</TR> many things I want to write about.
<TR>But,</TR> sometimes, everything seems to be uncertain. It seems like I have no real dream, and don't know much about myself.
When I was thinking about myself, I realized that I can't be a good writer just now. People who don't know their own selves can't write good stories.
Who am I?
I'm a middle school student. I'm the second daughter of my mother and my father. I'm a Korean girl whose dream is to become a writer. I'm a friend to my friends. And I'm Heejin.
<TR>Yes,</TR> I'm Heejin.
I was so sure about myself before.
I think my self-confidence has faded ever since I got a very bad score on an exam and lost interest in studying. I didn't study much, I admit it.
<TR>But</TR> I didn't expect my score to be as bad as it was.
The score was just a score for an exam, not my life.
<TR>And</TR> that score doesn't define my whole life.
I knew it!
I know it!
<TR>But</TR> it doesn't help.
I don't like studying anymore.
<TR>Actually,</TR> I hate it.
I just want to write stories, read books, listen to music, sometimes read poems, and draw pictures.
It's what I really want to do.
I want to study when I want to.
I don't want to care about scores, at least, I don't want to be bound by scores.
My middle school's score determines my high school, my high school's score determines my college, my college's score determines my job, my job determines my wage.
There's only one way to enjoy what I want to do during school.
To love studying.
<TR>Then,</TR> I'll be able to enjoy every moment.
The only problem is that I hate studying. ^^
I'll try to see myself, try to know more about myself, try to love studying, too.
<TR>Then,</TR> maybe I'll be able to love myself more.

"1022&<EV>Family trip at the beach</EV>

Saturday, August 6th, 2011.
Weather is sunny, hot, and a little wind comes through the window.

My mp3 player is broken.
I forgot that I had put it in my pocket, and I put my pants into the washing machine. <TR>And</Tr> when I got it again....... <TR>well</TR>, it was not working.
I'm really sad because I got it last winter, <TR>and</TR> it was my first mp3 player.
I think I was so tired yesterday because of the trip, <TR>and</TR> didn't realize I left my mp3 player in my pocket.
The trip was fun.
My family went to two beaches, one is named Sampo beach, <TR>and</TR> the other one is called Ayajin beach.
We spent two days at Sampo beach, and one day at Ayajin beach.
We went on trip at the end of all the boring rain.
(People who were selling something said that they couldn't see the sun for a month.)
<TR>But,</TR> it drizzled often during the trip.
I don't know why it rained so much this year.
I hope this is the real end to all the raining.
My penpal whose name is David told me that it didn't rain much in England this year, <TR>so</TR> he's worried about it. Why doesn't the rain know the word 'suitably'? I hope it will rain in England soon.
<TR>This year,</TR> Sampo beach wasn't very clean, I think it must be the rain that made it a little dirty.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> my family and I still played happily in the sea.
It was fun although the water in the sea was very cold.
Ayajin beach's scenery was very beautiful, </TR>but it wasn't very suitable to play on because of its big rocks.
Many water plants were living in the rocks.
The black, rugged rocks were sharp, <TR>and</TR> my father was hurt while he was swimming.
(He didn't see the rock, <TR>so</TR> he bumped into the rock.)
The cool baby-blue water (Or was the water's color green?), warm sand, a little wind blowing, seagulls flying closely, white waves, the sound of waves, the smell of the sea, a thin fog at the distance, made the beach seem like a heaven, really.
<TR>At the sea,</TR> my family saw a little boy playing on a tube.
The boy looked as if he were walking, but the boy's foot surely couldn't reach the bottom. My family was so curious.
<TR>So,</TR> my sister asked him how he moves in the sea.
He smiled and said that he could go forward if he pretends to be walking.
He was moving his legs quickly as if he were walking.
He was a very cute little boy, and looked smart, too.
He said that cicadas don't cry ""Maem Maem Maem"", and that they cry ""Miaem Miaem Miaem"". He was punished by his father when he sprayed water on my sister and me. His father said, ""You are not to spray water on females.""
My sister laughed quitely when she saw his cute expression.
<TR>And,</TR> my sister tired to follow his way of moving in his tube.
She said that she's his best pupil.
She moved her tube with great effort to follow the little boy's way even though her foot could reach the bottom.
Sometimes, she's really peculiar and I can't believe she's my older sister. ^^
I collected some pretty shells at the sea, too.
This trip was surely pleasant.
I'm looking forward to our next family trip, too although I don't know when it will be.

"1023&<EV>Volunteer work.</EV>

Saturday, July 30th, 2011.
It rained very hard for a few days even though it isn't rainy season; <TR>and</TR> many people suffered damages from the rain.
(It caused a landslide. As a result, some houses sank and collapsed. Some people even died. I was a little scared, too. My mom was worried very much when I went out to do volunteer work while it was still raining.)

I was really busy this week doing volunteer work with my friend.
I worked at a rehabilitation center for handicapped people.
People were running a summer school at the center for the handicapped children.
It was hard doing volunteer work there, <TR>but</TR> it was fun and rewarding.
I went to Lotte World (the amusement park), <TR>and</TR> swimming pool with the handicapped children.
It was exciting to ride the rides at Lotte World even though it was hard looking after the children. (Mmm.... After thinking about it, I realized that it's very weird for me to call them ""children"" <TR>because</TR> some of them are older than me. <TR>Then,</TR> what should I call them? Well, I think I just have to call them ""children"" anyway because I don't know all their names. I do know a few of their names like Gim Haeni. She can't do most things by herself, and someone has to help her. <TR>And often,</TR> I was that ""someone"". She couldn't say many words except for the words ""pretty"", and ""Yes"". Jang Hyeonmi has Down syndrome, <TR>and</TR> is very shy and cute even though she's older than me. Hong Juyeong and Gim Heejin (Her name and my name are the same), were cute, too. Heejin called me ""Sir"" and she liked me very much. There were also some other children.)
I screamed the whole time while on the pirate ship ride. I was scared, and the handicapped children were braver than me. ^^
The work at the swimming pool was harder than the work at Lotte World.
I had to change them, wash them, and look after them.
I was really overwhelmed, and had so little time for myself to wash and put on my clothes. <TR>Anyway</TR> it was fun to play with my friend and the children at the swimming pool, too.
I worked with the children for 4 days, and when I got home after volunteering, I always slept like a log. 
It was hard work, <tr>but</tr> I think it a was very beneficial time for me.

I'm so glad that the rain finally stopped yesterday.
I'll go to the sea with my family next week.
I'm looking forward to it.
It'll be fun!

Saturday, July 23, 2011
<TR>Now,</TR> it's cool because of the wind, <TR>but</TR> when I went on a walk with my family, it was really hot and sticky so I felt grumpy.

I'm so tired now.
Walking along the Han river in the humid weather made me tired.
<TR>And,</TR> my head is tired, too.
I can't think straight.
I'm sleepy, too.
My father is sitting in a chair, my mom is baking sponge cake in the kitchen, my sister is reading book in her room, a</TR>nd</TR> I'm writing this in the study, in front of the computer, next to the window.
The wind feel really nice, and I can hear the sound of a car running from the window.
You can also hear children's laughter coming from the playground which is in front of our apartment.
I'm gonna write an e-mail to my penpal, and read books after writing this.
Four days, including today, have already passed since the vacation ceremony. 
Time went by so fast.
I went to receive a classical guitar lesson last Wednesday.
I haven't been to my classical guitar lessons for a while because of my busy life with school. Since I didn't play and practice on my own, I had forgotten most of the music.
It was hard to play the classical guitar again, and the weather was so hot it was hard to stand.
(I had to bring my classical guitar for tuning. It had rained for several days, and my guitar's sound changed because of the moisture, and other conditions. <TR>So,</TR> I felt hotter than other people.)
<TR>But</TR> I felt good while listening to my teacher play, and to play the classical guitar again.
I think it would have been really nice if it hadn't been so hot.
I'm going to have classical guitar lessons during vacation once a week, every Wednesday.
One of my friends told me to call her when I go to the guitar school, <TR>because</TR> her house is near the guitar school.
She said she'll give me some movie files, and music files.
<TR>And</TR> I'll also be able to see her face, and chat with her for a little.
My family will go to the sea on August 3rd, 4th, 5th.
We'll have a great vacation there.
Surfing in the sea, lying in the tent that is on the beach, taking pictures, collecting shells, reading books in front of the sea, looking at the sea, listening to the sounds of the sea, sniffing the smell of sea, and dozing off after watching the sea.
I can't wait!
I don't know why I like the sea so much, or why I like the smell of sea.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> I like those all those things.
My friend and I promised to play badminton together starting from next week.

A rainy, foggy, cloudy day

<TR?>Last weekend,</TR> I went to the bookstore with my friend.
I was a little excited, <TR>because</TR> I haven't seen her in a few months.
She didn't change much although she grew a little taller.
(I envy her, I didn't grow at all. <TR>Actually,</TR> I only gained weight.)
We went to the bookstore and looked around. Jin yeong (She's the friend who went to bookstore with me. She had moved to Yangpeong, do you remember?) bought some workbooks to help her study. Her plan is solve half the workbooks during vacation and solve the remaining half of the workbooks during the semester.
I helped her choose the workbooks even though I'm not sure if she'll actually solve all those workbooks. ^^
I looked around for a nice English book (novel), too.
I looked for Sarah Dessen's books, <TR>because</TR> one of my penpals recommended her books to me.
There were only few books by Sarah Dessen at the bookstore.
I wondered why, <TR>because</TR> Sarah Dessen is a pretty famous writer for teenagers.
I was contemplating between two books.
The title of one book was more interesting than the other.
<TR>But</TR> the contents of the other book seemed better.
It is the story of a girl named Annabel, and how she learns to just listen.
It's about the process Annabel goes through to solve her problems with one boy's help.
I really like that book.
I wanted to buy it at the bookstore, <TR>but</TR> the book there was little dirty.
<TR>So</TR> I decided to buy it later through the internet.
I met another friend at the bookstore, too.
While we were looking around the store, someone touched my friend's shoulder.
I thought she was my friend's friend from Yangpeong.
<TR>But</TR> her voice sounded so familiar, that I looked up at her face.
She was my classmate in elementary school.
I was really surprised to see her there.
""Did the two of you already meet?"" she asked.
""<TR>Well,</TR> actually, we met today for the first time since Jin yeong moved to Yangpeong.""
""Really?""
""<TR>But</TR> we kept in touch,"" Jin yeong added.
""Yeah, that's true,"" I smiled.
We talked with our friend for a while, then she went away to her older sister.
We looked around a clothing store, too.
I found some nice T-shirts, but they were too expensive!
I was a little sorry to leave behind those clothes.
I have a few T-shirts to wear at home, and I don't like them very much.
We parted while chewing jelly that we bought together at the store.
I don't know when we will meet again.
Anyway, I had pleasant time with her.
Summer vacation is coming!
Vacation is starting next Monday.
I'm excited to have a vacation.
I want to have a good time with my family and friends.
I think I have some problem with my friends at school.
With my personality, if I like someone, I really like her (or him), and if I hate someone, I really hate, loathe her (or him).
And I hate some of my friends in my class.
These friends are really mean to everyone, or pretend to be gangster.
I don't have many problem with my friends who pretend to be gangster, because we don't like each other very much and we're not that close.
My biggest problem is with one friend who is very mean.
I don't like, no, no, ""don't like"" isn't the right way to describe how I feel.
I think I hate her.
And....... well, she likes me.
She thinks that we're close, and I'm her friend.
Sometimes she comes to me and complains, which starts a quarrel between us.
It's her way of being affectionate with friends.
And that's the problem.
I don't like her way of expressing affection to friends.
It really stresses me out.
She likes arguing with people all day long in school.
I really don't like it!!
Why on earth does she do that?
It only makes people tired!
I'm sure even she gets tired of fighting and saying ridiculous things. 
She interrupts me when I'm playing with my true friends.
She gets jealous so much, and she thinks I have to only play with her.
It's like she is saying, ""You have to be like a sunflower, and just look at me. You must keep pampering me. See me, listen to me. The earth revolves around me. I'm the queen.""
When she acts like a baby, I really want to shout at her, ""You're not a queen! You're not a baby! You're just a fat, big, ugly pig that is always crying and getting angry at people! I'm not your baby-sitter! Or the owner of a stock farm! I'm not raising a silly pig!""
I hate her almost as much as I hate Gim Seulgi.
<TR>But right now,</TR> I hate Gim Seulgi more seriously.
I'm worried about the rest year because I think I'll fight with her soon.
She is so selfish! She knows only herself!
She has a bad mouth that always finds faults with others.
When she said bad things about my friend who I really like, I got really angry at her.
<CO>To be honest, I only like four people in my class who I consider to be my real friends.

"1026&Whatever my dream will be

Saturday, July 9th, 2011.
Sun is behind the foggy sky.
It has been heavily raining for the past few days.

<EV>I'm listening to music, now.</EV>
I love all kinds of music, all music has its own power which makes me listen to it over and over again.
But I like upbeat, exciting songs more than ballads.
I realized something while reading books.
I have a little strange feeling about my future or dream these days.
Something that......... makes me nervous? Or afraid? Oh, no. It's not that.
Just....... I don't know? I can't imagine? No, I don't think it's that either.
I think I feel this way because I didn't know what my dream was.
But I realized that the feeling was wrong.
I don't have to feel like that, because I already know what I want to do, what I'm going to do, although I didn't realize I already knew it.
I'll read books, newspapers, all kind of things, and write about things.
I can't stop it.
I can't stop writing.
I can't stop planning what I'll write.
I can't stop reading books.
It's what I'm going to do, what I want to do, and what I really enjoying. 
Whatever my dream will be, I won't stop doing these things.
That's all.
It seems to be a little trivial, but it's very important to me.
I mean, it's important to me to know what I'm enjoying, what I like to do.
For a while, I didn't know what I liked, what I enjoyed doing, or what I wanted to do.
(Or did I just not realize it?)
Oh, my! It's already 7:55 P.M.
Time for dinner~
Well, I'll have dinner little later, after I finish writing this.
Gim Seulgi who I mentioned last time had no trouble this week.
(It's surprising that she hasn't had any trouble.)
She continues to follow us trying to read our faces.
I can't understand why she behaves like that.
Sometimes she stares us down, and sometimes she sucks up to us.
My friends pointed it out after getting annoyed with her, but she just said, ""I didn't. I didn't. <TR>Sorry,</TR> and I understand why you're angry. But I didn't stare you down"" with frightened voice.
She's really a strange one.
And I think she's changing. (And not in a good way, I swear.)
It must be us who is making her change.
She was afraid of becoming an outcast, and her personality changed to be more like an outcast. It's a strange thing, too.
<CO>Yeah, the delicious smell is coming from kitchen! I can't wait!

"1027&Not good results...and not good girl...

Saturday, July 2, 2011.
The sky is white with fog. 
The sun is behind the cloud.

<EV><TR>Finally,</TR> the exams are over!!
I'm happy because the tests are over, but the weather is gloomy, and the results are gloomy too.
I was really embarrassed with the results.
I didn't expect the results to be that bad.
<TR>First,</TR> I thought it couldn't be true.
But now, I know why my results are bad.
<TR>Well,</TR> my teacher didn't teach me everything, but it wasn't all her fault.
<TR>Honestly,</TR> I didn't study harder than my friends, and my life pattern was wrong.
I was always tired, so I did not have the best attitude about studying or resting.
It was natural that I would not get good results.
<TR>Well,</TR> I don't care about it anymore.
I believe I'll do better next time.
I have to make a plan, again. 
I think I didn't follow my plan last time because it seemed to be so impossible.
This time I will make my plan more possible, this time.
My pride won't let me stand it if I receive a worse score next time!
I will make an effort and do my best, that's all.
I'm looking forward to my school's summer vacation.
It'll be 2 weeks later, I think.
My penpals are on summer vacation already.
I envy them.
The weather is getting hotter and unpredictable.
I want to stay at home to study, rest, and play.
Ah, did I say this already?
My teacher said I can't move to a new department because I have already spent too much time at the cultural experience department.......
<TR>Well,</TR> I'm expecting my department to be more fun .
Hey, Eileen, I don't think I said this either.
About two weeks ago, my classroom got a transfer student.
Her name is Kim Seulgi, and she came from an all-girl's middle school that is in Seoul.
Her face isn't pretty or beautiful even though she seems to think that she's beautiful. Actually, she has many pimples all over her face.
And she puts heavy makeup on her face everyday. (Oh, my!!! I really hate it!)
She's fat and her head is too big. She also acts like a boy sitting with her legs apart, not wearing any underpants, and spitting on the pavement.
<TR>One day,</TR> she even didn't wear a T-shirt under the school's uniform so everyone could see the polka dots on her underclothes. 
I was ashamed of her.
(I didn't want to mention or insult this person's face and shape, because my face isn't pretty, either. But she acts so unpleasantly, I had to mention something about it.) She is very strange, talking about her older boyfriend, telling stories about kissing (goodness!), etc.
(She is always comparing Soul with our town here. God bless! She acts very snobby and wants to be treated as a leader, I think.)
Her personality is not pleasant at all, either.
I didn't want to be her friend, but she clung to us (my friends and me) so much. We didn't mind her that much at first, but she's really not a good person!
<TR>Now,</TR> we all hate her. I don't know why she clings to us all the time.
Doesn't she know that we hate her?
Or is she pretending not to know because she knows everybody hates her?
She's an outcast now.
I think she invited her own misfortune.
She lied, acted snobby, and did other bad stuff.
The seniors don't like her either.
I think her school life will soon be the worst.
She's a little pitiful.
But she's still acting like she's a queen.
I don't want to help her.
I really hate her.
<CO>I don't want to hang around with her, but don't want to hurt or offend her, either. What should I do? What should I tell her?
What should we say to such an impolite person like her?

Sunday, June 19th, 2011.
It's hot! Yesterday afternoon, the weather felt cold because I had a fever.
And now it's so hot, I can't stand it. Whew!

<TR>Yesterday,</TR> my department went to Semiwon in Yangpeong.
<TR>Before going to Semiwon,</TR> my friend and I had to wait for 1 hour at the station for other members to come.
And that was just beginning.
We went to Semiwon, though the way to Semiwon wasn't comfortable.
It cost 3,000 won to enter Semiwon.
We could exchange our tickets for products later, but my mom complained that the products were only worth 500 won.
We had to walk at Semiwon in the hot weather and we were not able to find cool shade.
It was below expectations.
There were a few water lilies, a few flowers, some grasses, water that smelled like fish, and a slippery street.
<TR>Wow,</TR> that's all I got for all of that difficulty?
My department activities until now have been going to a small bookstore, a spider museum, and Semiwon.
What do you think?
Do you think it's really worth the cost and time?
I am always tired after my department activities, and I don't know why I do those things: walking in the scorching sun, standing at the station for an hour, taking a subway train that had too many people, and I had no seat. And I used my own money for all that stuff.
I want to change my department.
Maybe the paper craft department, or the Hanji craft department, or the POP department.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> I don't want to be a culture experience department member any more.
Culture? What culture?
What did I experience from that activity?
<CO>It was really different from what I expected.

p.s. Do you remember Jin yeong who moved to Yangpeong?

Sunny, drowsy day.

Today is already June 11th!
I feel like midterm exams passed just a moment ago.
And here are more tests coming!
Exams, exams, exams, dull exams!
The world tests us endlessly.
Or it might be the school testing us.
I HATE exams! They make me nervous, and I feel stupid about it.
Studying isn't the problem. I don't hate studying as much as I hate taking tests.
I always have to try to read my mom's countenance after the results come out.
<TR>This time,</TR> we have lots of things to memorize, and the teachers didn't teach us everything that will be on the tests.
Sometimes, especially during exam time, I imagine what it will be like if I am a wizard or a famous singer, athlete, actress, or writer.
It will be wonderful if I could refuse to take the tests.
I'm listening to the music of Taylor Swift whose voice is very sweet and cool.
I feel relief when I'm listening to music.
I feel like I'm in another world when I'm listening music.
I love Taylor Swift's songs.
""Christmas Must Be Something More""
""Mine""
""White Horse""
""You Belong with Me""
""Stay Beautiful""
""A Perfectly Good Heart""
""A Place in this World""
""Ain't Nothing 'bout You""

""Our Song""
""Permanent Marker""
""Should Have Said No""
""Love Story""
""Teardrops On My Guitar""
That's just a list of some of my favorite songs and there are much more!
Her songs have many different charms.
I also love Jason Mraz's songs and R. Kelly's songs too.
I especially like the songs ""I'm a Flirt"", ""Love Love Love"", ""I'm Yours"", ""Curbside Prophet"", ""You and I Both"", ""Word Play"", ""Kicking With You"", ""Winter Wonderland"", ""Coyotes"", ""The world's Greatest"", and ""I Believe I Can Fly"".

Saturday, June 4th, 2011.
I thought I was melting like ice cream in the sun.

I went to the spider museum today with other members of the cultural experience department. It was pretty fun to look around the spider museum.
Although the museum's name was called the spider museum, there was many other things on display like stalactites, fossils, and other insects samples.
All kinds of spider samples were there, too.
Some spiders looked so creepy and big, but one of tarantulas was very cute, lovely and gentle.
The teacher let me touch it, and it felt really soft!
I fell in love with the tarantula at first sight.
<TR>Actually,</TR> I have wanted to raise a tarantula since a long time ago.
But it's difficult to raise one.
You know, a tarantula's natural habitat isn't found here, so you have to take care of many things to bring up a tarantula.
And the worst part is that my mom probably won't allow me to bring up a tarantula at home. <TR>Needles to say,</TR> my sister and father won't allow it, either.
Do you know that tarantula can live for about 15 years?
Generally speaking, our country's spiders live for about 1 to 2 years.
But tarantulas are different!
The tarantula that I touched was about the size of my hand.
But its baby was so small.
About 1cm? Or was it even smaller than that?
The teacher said it had been born about 6 months ago.
It has apricot skin and such a small shape that it looked weak.
The teacher said it takes off its skin several times as it grows.
He showed us the tarantula's skin that had been taken off by a big tarantula.
I also looked at the tarantula's big two teeth.
They were black and sharp.
I want to see a tarantula eating its prey.
I think the tarantula's crinose legs are the most charming part.

Monday, May 30th, 2011
It's very hot! I think summer is coming faster than it did last year.

I'm disappointed with my friends.
We had a Korean group report project, and there were a lot of problems with it while my family took a trip.
I didn't know about it because I was not at home.
And two of my friends made it seem like I made matters worse.
But that doesn't make any sense!
I am not the group leader, and it wasn't my fault.
My role wasn't to do the analysis.
They did say sorry later, but I still felt hurt.
However, they are going to talk about it again later.
My family took a short trip over the weekend.
We went to Anmyondo near the Western Sea.
<TR>Oh,</TR> I love the sound of waves and the smell of the sea!
I will live in a little house near the sea and mountain later.
It would be cool!
I really like the sea and mountains.
We ate sashimi, and maeuntang in the restaurant.
It was small in quantity, but delicious.
Surely shells in the Western Sea are much more beautiful than shells in the Eastern Sea. 
My older sister and I picked up some of those shells.
The golden shell that I picked up was so pretty that my sister wanted to take it.
When we went outside to look at the sea at night, we met people flying hanji lamps. They gave us one of the hanji lamps, too.
We were happy to let it fly.
<TR>Uh....... well,</TR> actually it wasn't a real hanji lamp, but it was similar. It filled up like a hot-air balloon, and it was made of red hanji. We lit the wick inside with fire and let it fly away.

Saturday, May 21, 2011.
Weather is getting hotter.
I'm going to wear my school's summer uniform when the next Monday comes.

I went to the university of Seoul with my school teachers and friends, today.
It wasn't fun at all.
We just saw the scenery around the university.
They didn't explain about the university very much while they showed off their school's scenery. We wanted to know more about the university and learn something, not to enjoy the scenery or study ecology.
I was disappointed.
What should I write in my report?
What did I learn from the visit?
I learned I should go to a university with good scenery?
It is too absurd to repeat!
<TR>Whew,</TR> well, I will have to figure out what to write myself.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> Eileen, do you know what the greatest invention that led to the advancement of Rome was?
It was the toilet and I think it is the greatest invention that humans have made.
Before that invention, Rome's road was full of poop.
Through the invention of the toilet Romans got rid of many diseases and were able to talk about politics in the public bathhouses.
Can you imagine living without a toilet?
If we didn't have toilets, we would have many embarrassing moments.
And we wouldn't be able to live in a high-rise apartment building because we have to run down as fast as possible every time we have an emergency. Or maybe people could use a poop carrier even though I wouldn't want to do that at all. Before the invention of the bathroom there was a movable bathroom in Rome. They carried big clothes and a bucket so when someone needed to go to the bathroom they would cover him with the clothes and make money doing this.

Saturday, May 14, 2011
Sunny, it's hot like summer.
The weather seems to be teasing me.
When I was at the retreat, it rained all day long, and now, it's the perfect weather to go outside.

Eileen, I went to the retreat 3 days ago.
My mother said I should carry her cell phone as she she would worry about me during the retreat.
(You know, I have no cell phone because I don't need it.)
But the teacher said we must not carry any cell phones, MP3 players, game consoles, etc.
I was a little disappointed with the news that I couldn't carry my MP3 player.
I carry my MP3 player with me every day and listen to music or Little Fox stories while going to school.
I really like listening to music and I had downloaded my favorite singer's songs a few days ago. (I love Jason Mraz, Taylor Swift, Westlife, R. Kelly, and so on.)
I wanted to let my friend listen to the songs that I like.
I had to carry sleepwear, gym clothes, socks, underclothes, biscuits, gum, writing supplies, and an umbrella.
I didn't expect to see any cell phones or MP3 players, but other students had brought those things not caring about what the teacher said.
<TR>Anyway,</TR> the teacher took away their cell phones.
<TR>On the first day,</TR> we went to the retreat place and lodge where we would stay.
The retreat place was in Naeseolak, surrounded with woods.
The lodge was not so bad, not so good.
We saw our friends' performance (singing and dancing), had time for recreation, and made a campfire. The teachers decided that our bedtime should be 10:00, but we went to bed at 1:00 a.m.
We talked about other friends and told scary stories.
It was fun.
<TR>On the second day,</TR> our activities included orienteering, rock climbing, and night time trace.
Rock climbing was so scary that I couldn't finish it, and I came down.
It was harder than it looks.
<TR>On the last day,</TR> we went to Baekdamsa, and played.
It was nothing to get excited about.
Sure, there were many big and nice trees, and their color was a cool green.
We ate lunch and came home.
<CO>The teachers were fun, and it was a pretty exciting retreat.

Today was the school anniversary so I was alone in my house all day long.
<TR>And I slept all day long, too.
I was sick with a fever. (I am sick now, too, but I'm getting much better.)
It wasn't a pleasant feeling at all to lay in bed with an aching head.
And it also wasn't a pleasant feeling to hear all the noise from the waterproof work, either.

Saturday, April 9, 2011.
Yellow dust that contains radiation came.
Sun that looks like an egg that burst is in the foggy gray sky.

<TR>A few days ago,</TR> the rain that fell contained radiation.
The government said that the radiation discovered in Korea is too little to worry about.
But many people worried about it, and they bought a lot of equipment to protect themselves. The government allowed school presidents to cancel grammar school if they were worried about exposing the children to radiation in the rain. <TR>Frankly,</TR> my friends and I are envious of the grammar school's students. I don't know whether it was my imagination or real, but it did not smell nice in the raining street. And as the wind blew, we were all wet with rain.
Wet and feeling pretty bad, I complained. ""Why should we have to go school, in a situation like this? My nerves are on edge whenever the rain touches my legs. We don't know whether it is safe or not. I'm not too sure but I think the government probably said something like this, 'It's not dangerous. And we don't have to care about it.' But how on earth can any kind of radiation be safe? Or be too little to worry about? And how can we know that it is only a little? It's just what the government said. How can we trust the government or what the government is saying?"" No answer, my friends just shrugged their shoulders. And my complaints just ended up in a little sigh.
Although it only rained a little, it rained almost all day long.
We couldn't play in the playground after lunch time, we couldn't even open the window, and we were all in a pretty bad mood. When I returned home, more bad news was waiting for me. An aftershock came to Japan. We watched the video about it with amazement. I think that if I was in Japan, I would be too scared to think straight.
That big aftershock! Buildings rolled from side to side, things fell down with a big sound, and the ground moved quickly. Woo- Just imagining it makes me nervous.

Well maybe I should call this week ""play time"". Because on Sunday, the 20th, my ma's friend from the USA came to meet us with her son. So we shopped in Dongdaemun Market. Actually I couldn't understand her son. Why? Well there is something that we should learn from American kids like budgeting to buy what they really need and want. But this guy was thinking too much. And if I were him, and it was my first time coming to Korea I would go to 두타 and buy the clothes that I want. Of course I'll buy everything at the lowest price I can find.

In the morning before we went to Dongdaemun, my family went to the World Cup Park. Because my dad suggested to us that we needed the excercise. We played soccer, badminton, and basketball.

But whenever my mother scolds me I just want to throw something. But I didn't.
But I thought if I could fix the things that my mother scolds me about, I won't have to hear it anymore, right? So this is the last part and I wanted to talk about this thing for a long time. Agree? Got it? Well, let's start it.
Well let me first start here with the list of things that I should fix. There could be more.
1.I just always want to hear compliments.
2.I think about the past a lot.
3.I get angry easily.
4.My mind does not always have deep thoughts. 
5.Sometimes I give in to another person too easily.
6.I'm not confident.
7.I care too much about what another person will think about me.
8.I'm not good at talking about my feelings.
9.Sometimes I can't control my mind.
10.Sometimes I give up, but not always.
11.If there is a hard part I always try to avoid it, and if I do I always regret what I did.
12.Recently I don't laugh as much as I used to.
13.I should be more positive.
14.I exaggerate a lot. 
15.I am tactless.
There's a lot, right? Did you thought about your faults? Did you try to fix them? Well I tried but it's hard. But I started thinking about this more because there is a person who I really don't want to be like. But most people say that I'm similar to that person. And I don't want to ruin my life. 
So if I fix this I'll be a much better person. Everybody thinks that I am a nice person, especially my friends who also think that I am cool. 

Did you think of yours? Do you have a reason for why you should fix your faults? I've got mine, I wish you will find yours!

<TR>Well,</TR> this is the last part. Thanks for talking with me guys. I hope the next season's writer is funny. I want to see the movie ""127 Hours,"" that is a real story and I saw it on the Discovery Channel! Is it over?

<TR>Well,</TR> maybe you guys asked your mothers at least once about going to the theater to watch the movie ""Tangled"". Well in Korean it might be called Rapunzel. 
<TR>Well,</TR> I didn't like the story that much.
But when I saw this movie's trailer, I liked the story for the first time. Well I admit that this story is funny. And maybe you guys will think that it's childish for teenagers, right? But trust me most of the teenagers will like it more than their little brothers.
<TR>Okay,</TR> today I watched this movie. It was funnier than I thought. Come on it scored 9.0 out of 10. Pretty high, huh?
Well I didn't think that the man was telling the story about Tangled. Well we should call him Flynn although his real name is Eugene. He is telling the story of how he met Rapunzel and about how she became the lost princess. Should I tell you about this? Come on if I tell you this it won't be funny. <TR>Well,</TR> at least I can tell you this one thing about how this girl got magical hair 70 feet long that glows when somebody sings the spectacular song. There was a kingdom and the queen was having a baby but she was sick, terribly sick. And there was a golden flower created by the sun. It was magical but it was cared for by the witch. She just sang and she became much younger. But the soldiers found the flower and fed it to the queen. <TR>Later,</TR> the princess was born with golden hair. One night the witch came to the sleeping princess and sang. The hair glowed but when she cut part of it that part lost its power and turned brown. So she kidnapped her and raised her in the tower. She always warned her that the outside world was dangerously full of egoists and cruel people. <TR>So</TR> she believed the witch to be her mother and she believed what she was telling her until she caught Flynn. Well he didn't try to come to see her. He was just running away from the soldiers, actually the horse named Maximus. So he saw the tower and went inside. And then they make a deal that if he shows her the lanterns in the sky (the kingdom always floats lanterns for the princess on her birthday) she will give him the crown that he stole. So the story begins.
How was it? It was funny. I liked it. I don't like Disney princesses but I like her. She is funny. Well sometimes she looks childish and confused. Same with Flynn. What a great relationship! I like the part where Maximus tries to catch him and she stopped him and trained him like a dog. It was funny. 
I wonder if there will be a ""Tangled 2."" It might be funny! Most sequels aren't funny. But I'm sure that this will be. ""Mulan 2"" was funny. I want to be like her. Really. Well most people say that I am cute and look smart and confident. But you are wrong~ hee... <SR>I am totally different. Well let's still say I am cute and smart. Confident? Let us think about it. I am childish. I exaggerate a lot of my actions but sometimes I'm funny.</SR> Sometimes I don't know why I do this. Maybe you will think that I am crazy. But trust me.

Asian Cup soccer games!</EV>

Howdidoo fellas!
I saw a small message when I entered the Little Fox website. It said that they will choose new participants for English diary writing. Uhh~ I wanted to write more!! You see I love to talk with you guys! I thought it was for years. But rules are rules. But I will have fun until 28th.

It might be a little late to write about this here. Well do you guys remember Asian Cup soccer games? It was fun but I got upset when we lost the game against Japan. <TR>Well,</TR> I am sure that they have improved a lot in offense. 

If I compare South Africa World Cup with Asian Cup, our weakness is still in defense. But after I watched the game against Japan, I could see the fatal weakness. Our team was great when they drove a ball toward the goalpost. But they always kick the wrong way or miss the chance because they kick the ball too quickly and incorrectly. Many people might have noticed this. That's the difference between a European soccer team and Korean soccer team. If we practice more to improve this weakness and passing skills i'm sure we will be great in Brazil World Cup in 2014.

But I'm sad that the team captain Park and Lee Young-pyo had to retire from the Korean national soccer team. I heard that they are only 31 and 32 years old. But they will work great abroad.

<CO>And our national team's players are young. So we have a bright hope for future Korean soccer.
It's a good thing.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,"Nicely done - write about how it feels when Korea loses to Japan. Also, try not to be too informal as this could lead to bad habits later in your writing career.",//

Life is Beautiful
(PS: Of course my life is beautiful. But this one is about a movie.)

Hi!

I told you guys that I love to watch movies. Because I like to listen to and watch other people's feelings and their thoughts.

This time we (Dahnu, Seowu, and I) watched the movie ""Life Is Beautiful"" in the morning!

Well the story is about a man who is very positive. And he travels through countries and then he meets a beautiful woman who will be his wife. So they get married and they have a son named Joshua. And they have a wonderful life before the German soldiers take this happy family because it was World War II and they were Jewish, even though it was very dangerous in the prison. Because they were having terrible experiences with them. 

This is the highlight of this movie. One day soldiers took them because they were Jewish. In the prison almost everyone had to die. <TR>And of course,</TR> Joshua should have too. So if you were his parent, would have told him the truth about reality? Maybe lots of parents might say yes, because their value is reality. But the man who is positive didn't tell Joshua the truth. For instance, the soldier director said he needed a translator to tell them that they must work and they should be sent to the lab, which will make them into soap, and to go to the shower room, but actually it doesn't have water, maybe only toxic gases. This man didn't wanted Joshua to hear this and he wanted to save Joshua. So he translated it as, ""If you don't cry for your mama, and if you work hard, you'll get 1000 points and the winner will receive a real tank. So the reality is opposite of this man's translation right? And now Joshua thinks this is playtime. And the man, no matter what happens and no matter how, he tries to escape with his family. Well he dies, but Joshua and his beautiful wife survive. And the most tearful thing is that at the end the war is over so the prisoners could go back to their homes. And when Joshua comes out of his hiding place, the good soldier on the tank asks him if he wants a ride. Joshua's dream came true. But his father died the day before. But he saved his family.

It was a long movie. And it gave me a lot of thoughts. So I suggest you guys to watch this movie. Because it teaches you that sometimes you need a positive mindset even though your family might be dead in the shower room or turned into soap. But it can save your family. And it makes you stronger. <CO>This is a very old movie, but it got many Academy Awards, so if you have a chance I recommend you guys to watch this movie. </CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Conclusion is good.

The tears of Africa

Hi!

Did you guys watch the documentary ""Tears of Africa,"" which is a part of the series called “Tears of the Earth”?

I watched ""Tears of the Amazon"" and it was great and gave me a lot of thoughts. 

There are two reasons I watched this program. <TR>First,</TR> I am interested in Africa (and I wanted to watch this series). <TR>Second,</TR> this program's PD graduated from my elementary school and middle school. She was good at languages and was one of the best students. I always wanted to meet her. And she could have gone to the Amazon as the PD but they said that it was too harsh for women so she was with ""Tears of Africa.""

I liked the Sahara desert part. <TR>Because</TR> the people of this area were most similar to modern people. I liked the boy who was mainly in this documentary named 'Ibrahem'. The strange thing is that this tribe thinks men should wear make-up. Plus they held a contest that was like Mr. Sahara? Anyway it was interesting to see another country's tradition. 

<TR>But</TR> like the documentary's title, I could see the African tears. The baby elephants are dying because the lakes all dried up. Maybe you guys will know the reason. It was terrible. Now it seems so normal to find the dead bodies of baby elephants. 
And some of the people came to South Africa to work there. But one of them was burned alive!! <TR>Because</TR> they are running out of jobs even in their own country. <TR>So</TR> they think they must not give their jobs to the other workers who are from another country. And his family struggled to live. The son burst into tears when the PD asked him about his father. I was sad too.

Industrialization has given tears to the earth. When I grow up I want to be a doctor who works in MSF, and I want to be a scholar who works with nature. And when I get older I want to be the president of the UN. Why? I want to make some proper decisions to help achieve world peace. <TR>Actually,</TR> we all should. So I want to choose a job that could help the poor people and nature. We need some proper decisions and we should put our ideas into practice. We can't make decisions all day but not do anything--that would be useless, right? <TR>So,</TR> I want to be the president of the UN. It is my dream. <CO>I asked my mom, ""Is there is a job that would let me work for nature and help poor people?"" She told me I should be the president of the UN. So my dreams are these. When I watched this program I had a strong feeling like this. What do you think? Do you want to volunteer for MSF(국경없는 의사회) with me?</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,Don't begin a sentence (especially a paragraph) with a conjunction (BUT/AND/OR).

홍대
Hi!

Did I tell you guys that I will buy an iPod case?

<TR>Today,</TR> I, my sister Dahnu, and my piano teacher went to 홍대 to buy an iPod case.

Maybe I told you guys that I learn piano, right? But I never told you about my piano teacher. True? <TR>Well,</TR> then let me tell you guys about her.

Before I tell you, do you learn piano? How is your teacher? Is she scary, tough, too sensible, or just normal? One of my friends said that he and his teacher had a bet about 한자급수 test. The loser had to buy 떡볶이 for the winner. 

My teacher is like a sister to me. She always listens when we have a problem. And the best thing is she always buys us presents when it is our birthday, 추석, 설날, or Pepero Day. Or graduation and entrance into school. My sister and I got stick perfumes as Christmas gifts. It looks like a thick lipstick or glue tube. But the smell is strange. I mean mine is too fragrant so that it makes me dizzy. I just rub it when there is a bad smell around me. She said that we're going to be ladies so we need to learn about lady things. Well I liked it. Maybe my sister liked it a lot. The other memorable gift is a pop-up book. When I was in second grade or third grade, I got my favorite present. A pop up book on Harry Potter, Hogwarts School, in a three dimensional book that has four big pages. Exactly the same as the movie. And there were models of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Malfoy. It was really cool. Do I have it now? Well... Mom! Do we have that..!!! Mom wouldn't throw it away. That is my precious thing!!!!

<TR>Anyway,</TR> we went to a shop called ""Fresebee"". There were lots of iPod cases. Various. What did I buy? I bought a case made of leather that is indigo and black in color. That was a new model. There is an elastic band behind the case. If you want to put it on your finger and watch things comfortably pull the band. And with that position you can stand the ipod and you don't have to hold it in your hand or you don't have to bow your head. It was expensive but I wanted to buy it. I feel that I can use it for a long time. <TR>So,</TR> I and my sister selected that case. We went upstairs and saw lots of iPhone cases. Is this a discrimination between phones and iPods? Hey yo! This is not a tea pod! There were lots of cases, more than four times the cases for iPods. I didn't buy an iPhone. Because I heard that iPhones disconnect a lot. And my father has a Galaxy S and if we buy it we might pay a lot. <TR>With that money,</TR> I could buy books like May Bird, the Lord of the Rings and the Diary of A Wimpy Kid, A Ring of Endless Light series... etc.

<CO>After shopping we bought neck warmers. Our teacher said that it was another present for us. Mine is brown, and my sister's is black. We made a deal that we would take turns wearing them. Do you have a nice piano teacher like mine? No? Too bad.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,"Good but you must stay on topic - if you do not, each small subject you disuss will never recieve the proper amount of attention required to properly discuss and express your concerns regarding it.",//

At Itaewon </EV>

HI! 
I am too tired to hit the keyboard keys.
I am very cold and tired.

OK. Let me explain why I am very tired.

I'm doing the English Winter Camp at Yeouido Middle School. Kris, our foreign teacher, planned the schedule to go to Itaewon and interview people.(They had to be foreigners.) This project was one of my favorite parts of English camp.

I thought it would be very easy. Because I have talked with foreigners several times. <TR>So</TR> it was easy as pie to talk with foreigners. 

<TR>But</TR> there were lots of difficulties. It was hard to find foreigners on the street in winter but it wasn't easy to talk with unknown strangers. But when we realized that time was running out, we didn't care about how shy we were. 

Sometimes I was kicked out of the market while I was interviewing foreigners. The manager told us to get out; the reason was that the place was a private place and resting place so they shouldn't be disturbed. But the Foreigner said ok. I hate that shop. What is that shop? OK, it is famous for coffee. Maybe I could say, stardollar?

<TR>Though</TR> I had many difficulties, we met 6 good people. Among them I liked Peter and Stephanie. Peter was visiting Korea for business. <TR>And</TR> he just came to Korea, and he is staying here for 2 days. He said the most memorable experience in Korea is now. When we were interviewing. he told us to teach him some Korean, and he asked us what is ""thank you"" in Korean. So we taught him 감사합니다. It was his first time but he was really good.
Stephanie was friendly like Peter. She said Korean people are very kind. But I don't think so. She was a student and she is living here for 7 months. She is studying the Korean language. <TR>And</TR> she was really good. She could write her name in Korean very neatly and she could say anything in Korean. And Kris told us that she was on the phone, and she was talking to her friend and telling her that she was in Itaewon and her students were interviewing foreigners. When Stephanie heard that, she told Kris that we were cute and very good.

We couldn't interview 10 people but only 6. The group of boys interviewed 10 people. They interviewed people from Brazil, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Poland. Really cool! We interviewed people from Germany, England, the U.S.A., and Canada. Another group interviewed a woman from the program '서프라이즈‘ of MBC.

<TR>Today</TR> I'll write as shortly as I can since I don't have much time.

<TR>Actually</TR> we were going to 홍대 because we had to buy ipod cases. But my cousin, my grandmother, and I went to Kyobo. Most of you guys know about Kyobo. My favorite place is Kyobo. Why? There are lots of cool stuffs and new books!

<TR>Before</TR> we left our house, we watched a drama called ""Dreamhigh,"" chapters one and two, which were reruns. It was really fun. My mother usually doesn't want us to watch dramas but my mother suggested it strongly. My mother suggested it to us because starring in it is 배용준, 조수미, etc. <TR>So</TR> she thought this movie had invested lots of money.

<TR>Anyway,</TR> we went to Kyobo but I was terribly angry. Why?

<TR>Because<TR> I left my monkey watch at my house! What a doofus. It had broken when I was about to go to middle school. <TR>So</TR> I had told my mom to get it fixed. <TR>So</TR> we had to bring it to Kyobo, but one year had passed. I forgot to bring it again! <TR>Actually</TR> my mother didn't tell me that we would go to Kyobo. She told me that we were going to 홍대, and if we had time we would go to Kyobo, so I didn't bring it. Then I was angry.

<TR>So</TR> my grandma noticed that I was really sad. <TR>So</TR> she bought me a new gorgeous watch. I always wanted to have a watch that is water resistant, digital, has a timer, and a count down, which is black.

There were two corner booths that were selling watches. At the first place, there were lots of watches but I didn't want any of them. <TR>And</TR> we went around to the second booth which had many watches I liked, but it was expensive. <SR>I was terribly sad. <TR>But</TR> grandma took my sisters and cousin to the first booth, and my mother took me to the second booth.</SR> My mother told me to not care about the cost, but to just select the one I liked. I liked all of them. I didn't know which I should select. I wore black colors but Mother told me it was too boyish. <TR>But</TR> I liked that style. <TR>So</TR> my mother suggested a blue color.

College Fund (P.S. Do you think the theme of today's diary is hard? Does it make your head buzz?)</EV>

Hi!
Today's theme might appear as hard when you enter my diary section. Right, I agree. But I think you guys should think about this. If you don't have time to think much, how about you think with me right now? If your mother tells you to study, tell her something like, ""Mom, I'm studying, and plus we'll be discussing my college fund. Miss M wants to discuss it with me!""(Who is Miss M? I have four names. Yoo Gee Wu, as you know, GW, Christine, and Marielle. I could have been Michelle but my dad's friend stopped him, because in the USA there are lots of girls whose names are Michelle. And there are lots of kids whose English names are Christine, so my most recent English name is Marielle. This was my name history, haha...)

Well I'm the oldest in our family, so I talk about college with my mother. <TR>Well,</TR> in five years I will go to college. I know there are lots of kids who are excellent at their studies. But also there are lots of kids who are good at their studies, but some do poorly. That is unfair. So I say that life is unfair. Why, most students want to go to Seoul University and Yonsei University schools of medicine. <TR>However,</TR> it costs a lot. But what about poor kids who study well enough to go to schools like that?

<TR>So,</TR> I asked my mom about it and my mom said they should have scholarships or get loans from the bank. But what about the kids who don't have good enough grades for a school fund, and what if they don't get the scholarship? What happens to them?

<CO><TR>So,</TR> my opinion is if they have enough ability to enter places like Seoul University and Yonsei University, I think the government should help them with a college fund. When I was 12, I was in 어린이 법제관. It is a place where kids could find and think about the problems that surround us. I once had an opinion about school funds. <TR>And,</TR> I wish the poorest kids who want to study in college could study without any worry about money.</CO>

Let's talk about things that make us feel peaceful.

Hi!
I heard that during this year's Christmas, there might be snow. 
This means it could be a white Christmas.

Snow makes us feel peaceful I think. I feel like snow is mysterious, pleasant, and peaceful.

<TR>So,</TR> I don't have a typical subject to write, since I already wrote today's highlight. So let's talk about things that make us feel peaceful.

<TR>In my case,</TR> reading books makes me feel peaceful. I like reading. <TR>Well,</TR> watching movies are fun too. <TR>But</TR> it's not peaceful. Maybe I can tell you the differences and similarities between movies and books. Well, both are things that I like the most. <TR>And</TR> the difference is that if I watch too many movies, I feel an uneasiness and a little sad (it's still a mystery why I feel like this. Even after funny movies.) <TR>But</TR> when I spend lots of time with books, I feel happy and calm. 

What about you? <TR>Because</TR> all we're different, maybe we have different things that make us feel peaceful. <TR>And</TR> plus, nature makes me feel peaceful.

If I had to describe a place that makes me feel peaceful, it might be the English library or the forest. The forest is one of my favorite places. My mother told me that in Oregon state (where my hometown is) there are a lot of trees, forests, and rain. <TR>So</TR> after the rain it was gorgeous. Just like the jungle scene in the movie Tarzan. 
My mother said that I was a baby who really liked to cry. Nothing could stop me except these four things: a Barney doll, a racoon, the taped video, 'Bear in the Big Blue House', and the forest. My mother said it was funny that I always stopped weeping in the forest. <TR>But</TR> still I like the forest. It's a quiet place to see green leaves, where the sky is covered with green leaves and sunlight coming down between the leaves. <CO><TR>Because</TR> of the sunlight the leaves turn the color of limes. <TR>And</TR> I can see birds flying, and hiding from us.
It's very peaceful. <TR>So</TR> what do you say, What makes you feel peaceful?</CO>

Hi!
<EV>Today, I got some very exciting news. 
The news is that 'I, Geewu, got an ipod.' </EV>
My uncle bought it from the U.S.A. <TR>And</TR> he also bought one for my sister too. 

<TR>So</TR> today was the start of winter vacation. <TR>So</TR> I took it with me to school to show everybody my ipod4. <TR>Even</TR> my friends were jealous. <TR>So</TR> they said, ""Hey, why did you bring it here?"" <TR>So</TR> I said, ""It was boring in school to listen to the president's speech through the microphone, so I brought it."" <TR>And</TR> some of my friends replied like this, ""Of course, she brought it here to show it to us.""
<TR>Well</TR> I was kinda hurt because she was my best friend. <TR>And</TR> some boys wanted to see my ipod. <TR>But</TR> they broke a boy's iphone's LCD the other day. <TR>And</TR> my father warned me to be careful. If you were me would you have given it to them? Of course not. <TR>Well</TR> finally a nasty boy who has pimple bombs on his face took it away. I didn't want that situation, but he took it. <TR>And</TR> I thought if I pulled it, it might be broken, so I let him see my ipod. <TR>And</TR> my girlfriends asked whether I liked him ( Hey guys, if one of you guys are reading my diary, don't think that I like that pimple master. Heesh;;) 
<TR>Then</TR> one of my friends who is from Senegal asked me very carefully whether or not he could look at it for a moment. We are friends with each other even though he is a boy, and I trust him. <TR>So</TR> I told him, ""Just be quiet while you're using it. I don't want any other boys to get teased."" 

<TR>So</TR> I learned lessons today with my ipod that I'll not take my ipod to my middle school again. I hope you guys have learned it from my diary. <TR>Well</TR>, all things have two sides.

<TR>Well</TR>, this was the bad side, but also there was a good side.

I was really scared. <TR>Yeah,</TR> now you're calling me a baby. <TR>Anyway,</TR> after I saw the movie I had to go to the bathroom, and then I saw all the things that was in the movie.

I like little fox</EV>

Hi!
We like Little Fox, don't we?
<TR>Actually</TR> one of my hobbies is watching Little Fox.

I like ""Willow Creek Twins."" I like Katie. She is very funny. Just watching her face makes me smile. When Luke and Katie had a fight, Luke hung up the phone. <TR>And</TR> so did Katie. That part was very funny. My sisters and I watched that over and over again. 

""Fun at Kids Central"" is fun too. When I saw this title I thought it was for younger kids. It was totally fun. The topic is about how American kids play. I really wanted to eat s'mores. Melt marshmallows+chocolates+ graham crackers= s'mores=delicious time=I want more. If I have a chance to live in America, <TR>first,</TR> I'll go camping with my sisters and then we'll make s'mores. 
Did you guys watch ""Four Square""? It's like playing with a bouncing ball in four squares. There are lots of rules though. <TR>But</TR> it looks super fun. I want to play it with my friends <TR>but</TR> they don't understand the rules. <TR>And</TR> most of them don't like sports like I do. I wish I can play it before I go to college.

<CO>Watching Little Fox is one of my favorite things. Oh, I forgot. My sisters and I always wait for Wednesday. Why? Because new chapters of ""Secret Garden"" always come out every Wednesday. I didn't read the ""Secret Garden"" book. My sister Dahnu read it. She said that I have to read that book before I die. I think I should. Hey, tomorrow is Wednesday! Yes!

<EV>About Extinct Animals</EV>

Hiya fellas!
Looks like I have my energy back again.
These days I have been very tired..
Recently I'm enjoying reading a book called ""Gap of Nature (자연의 빈 자리)."" Actually this book is required reading. <TR>But</TR> when I saw the cover picture and this mysterious title, it attracted me.
The cover picture was of a dodo (the most stupid bird in the world, it was kind of funny.)
Interesting, huh? Gap of Nature, not gap of my socks... 
This book is about extinct animals, which have disappeared in the past 500 years. 
There were lots of animals. The surprising thing was that there was lots of species of mice. The most common reason that they've become extinct is because of mice, cats, and white people (from Europe). <TR>But</TR> I couldn't understand that mice were a cause of extinction, even though they became extinct. Mainly animals in Australia, 뉴칼레도니아, and especially birds in Hawaii were extinct.
<CO>There are lots of animals that have been disappearing for the past five hundred years. I was really sad. Only a few of them became extinct naturally, <TR>but</TR> the others were not. Tame animals like Forkland dogs became extinct. They were very tame so people tricked them with meat and kill them. If I had been them I would have rather raised them as my pets. There are 16 kinds of species of gazelles, and the red gazelle has become extinct. Blue antelopes, Christmas rats, and wallabies have also become extinct. I think if you are a kid on the earth, we should take these problems really seriously. I don't want any more pretty little things to become extinct. Are you with me? </CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,"Discuss in further detail how these extinctions make you feel. Also, perhaps offer a solution to the cause of extinctions that aren't natural.",//

<EV>About lost dogs</EV>

Hi! Do you feel well? My sisters got really ill. Too bad. It's too cold, isn't it?

<TR>Anyway,</TR> I'm here to talk about lost dogs. 
Do you watch ""Man's Right (남자의 자격)""? It's funny. <TR>And</TR> last time they had a mission to adopt stray dogs. When I heard this mission I was excited even though I don't have any dogs.
All the stray dogs were cute! I didn't understand why people kicked them out of the house. If they bought them, they have a responsibility to keep them, right? For some reason I started to hate these kind of humans.
They were really cute in 남자의 자격. They had a lot of shock when they were with the bad former owner. They tied their necks with strong, rough ropes, gave them rotten food, <TR>and</TR> always hit them when they saw them. I think they are very bad living creatures on this earth. I mean why do they have to do that kind of thing to their poor dogs? They didn't do anything wrong. The most important thing that I couldn't understand about those masters was why they bought them. They just waste their money and they just hurt those dogs.
Most dogs in the animal shelter, especially the dogs, if they don't get masters in 10 days they get an easy and painless death. This is really unfair.
<CO><TR>So,</TR> after I saw this program I promised to myself, if I raise a dog I will adopt a stray dog. <TR>So,</TR> I will raise he or she well. <TR>And</TR> make them feel comfort. I think it's the right attitude if you raise dogs. Will you guys promise that you will adopt stray dogs, and if you buy a pet you'll never make them become like stray dogs?</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,"Nice reflection on the topic.

Hi! It's pretty cold isn't it? 
<TR>Well,</TR> I'm in my warm, cozy house. <TR>But</TR> I'm worried about the guys who don't have any homes. They have to sleep outside, right? What a nasty life.
Well the final exam for the 1st year is over, and I feel free but loosen in other ways. <TR>So</TR> I decided to read my favorite books and write my diaries in English, like I'm writing it now.
Do you know the show, '환경스페셜‘? Well I like that program. <TR>Because</TR> I'm interested in nature. 
The program was about Gondwana, which is in Australia. It was about the ancient animals that lived a long time ago.
Do you know the continent Pangaea? <TR>Well,</TR> if you don't know, I have to tell you that a long time ago the continents were gathered together. <TR>And</TR> when time passed by, it split up into pieces. <TR>And</TR> Australia was one of those pieces. <TR.So,</TR> on this continent there were a lot of ancient animals, especially 'pouched animals'. Pouched animals have the same body specialties as their name. They have pouches to keep their babies in. Yeah, you got it. Right, it's like kangaroos, wombats, etc... . <TR>But</TR> they are going to become extinct. Already one species of wallabies are extinct. <TR>So</TR> we have to keep our eyes on this problem.
<TR>And,</TR> do you guys know the sea cow? <TR>Well,</TR> your face is telling me that I'm asking you the wrong question. It's not a sea horse. Sea cows are like 듀공. Do you know that they're also going to become extinct? 
<CO>Gondwana is a famous place for living ancient animals. <TR>But</TR> people killed a lot of them. <TR>Nowadays</TR> they are very hard to find. If we kill them today, it's a crime. <TR>But</TR> some bad people are still doing things like that. <TR>But</TR> there is a problem on this earth. People only think about their money, not nature. They have destroyed too much. We should stop this. I don't want to hear questions like, ""Mom, what are kangaroos?"" from my child.

brr...
Well it's freezing, but Hi!
Do you feel the fall? In Yeouido, there are lots of beautiful fall trees along the sidewalks. <TR>And,</TR> they all turned yellow, red, etc.. When I walk there, I feel like I'm in the movies. It's really awesome, you guys have to come and walk there!
<TR>Today,</TR> I'm going to write about our special English class day. It was special because it was an open class. Our school teachers and another 45 English teachers from another school came to our London class to attend and watch our English class. (We have 3 levels of English classes. We were divided into them based on our English exam scores. The best class is London, next is New York, and the lowest class is Sydney. I'm in the top class. ^^)
Why did they come to our class? <TR>Because</TR> their purpose is to teach in better ways. <TR>So</TR> they came here to watch ways and methods of how my teacher teaches an English lesson. I think my teacher was very nervous because she practiced it for a week with us. Which was rehearsal. If I was a teacher, I think, I wouldn't have a rehearsal. It's not like the real thing. 
<TR>Anyway</TR> my teacher said that she was nervous, just as I thought. <TR>But</TR> I wasn't nervous. <TR>Because</TR> the 45 people? It's nothing. I gave a speech in front of 400 students many times in my elementary school. I was the English speech winner two times, the heroine of an English musical concert, gave a speech that was for school president elections, etc. Maybe more than 30 times on the big stage? <TR>At that time</TR> I was not nervous at all. I felt the concert hall was like my room, <TR>but</TR> this time it was just a small class; there was no reason why I should have been nervous.
At last we started. And my teacher's voice trembled. (You'll know what I'm talking about. I just don't want to say 'nervous' more.) <TR>So</TR> the class went on with my teacher's Powerpoint on the electric board. And it was time to talk in front of people about the article that we were doing. It was just summary talking time. </TR>So</TR> the teacher told us, ""If you want to do it, then just raise your hand and come out in front of us."" <TR>But</TR> who is going to raise their hand in that situation? Of course not. I was quiet. <TR>But</TR> my friends recommended me. What good friends...! <TR>So</TR> I stood in front of the class and spoke out. The responses were great. One of my school teachers asked me whether I had lived in the USA or not. <TR>So</TR> I answered that I was born in Oregon state and I lived there for 21 months after birth, </TR>and</TR> my mom said I only watched Korean videos and US TV there. <CO>They were very surprised. <TR>Well</TR> I know that I talked like an American teenager. How can I speak like this? Well, my hobby is doing Little Fox and reading a lot of English books, and watching foreign movies in English.

SPORTS DAY</EV>
Hi! 
The midterm exam ended two weeks ago. During those two weeks I had lots of work waiting for me. <TR>Plus</TR> I was very tired because of the exam.
Today was a sports day. Do you know what a sports day is? Usually in elementary school we compete with our families on sports day. <TR>But</TR> it's different in middle school. It is not with family anymore. It's just for students. <TR>And</TR> there are different kinds of games for each grade. In first grade we did bodyguard dodge ball. The second grade did basketball, and the third grade did kickball.
My class is one of the best sports classes in the first grade. <TR>So</TR> we were sure that we were going to win. I was chosen to be a player in my class. My bodyguard was a swimmer who won the silver medal in a Seoul swimming competition. 
I practiced a ball game yesterday with my father. I was worried about my throwing skills. <TR>So</TR> my dad taught me some moves in martial arts (well my father teaches me martial arts; kung fu, taekwondo, etc. are types of martial arts.)
It was a move to hit someone in martial arts. <TR>But</TR> it was a similar movement to throwing a ball. Maybe I practiced it for five or ten minutes? <TR>But</TR> I was getting much better.
That practice sure helped me a lot. I killed 10 or 15 pairs of opponents. Some boys said that I looked like the MVP today. Or their attitude looked like they were admiring me. <TR>But</TR> I really was great today.
Even though we did our best, we were second. <TR>Because</TR> I was out. I fell into the corner. Near the 4th class player. <TR>And</TR> my bodyguard didn't protect me. <TR>After</TR> that we got double out, and we lost. <TR>So,</TR> we got 70.000 won as a prize. I was angry that we're always second. <TR>Last handball game,</TR> we were second. (We were better than the 6th class but the judges were unfair a lot of times. <TR>But</TR> I'm happy that this game was not like that.)

Hi.
Is it strange that I say hello to you? <TR>Well</TR> I think this one word is very simple but neat. <TR>So</TR> I decided to say a neat hello.
Ok, after this neat hello, I'm here to write about the movie Blind Side. 
<TR>Usually,</TR> if someone says that a movie sure did take away my stress, others will think that the movie must have been a comedy. <TR>Because</TR> that's usually the situation after seeing a comedy movie. <TR>But</TR> this is different.
This is a touching movie. A true story of one of America's famous football players. America is famous for various people from all around the world, but also for racial discrimination.
In spite of this, a wealthy white lady adopts this poor boy who has no place to rest, who isn't good at his studies, and is a big black boy. His name is Big Mike.(I think you should call him Michael. <TR>Because</TR> he told this lady that he doesn't like to be called Big Mike. <TR>So</TR> she decided to call him Michael.) The P.E. coach saw Michael's possible future as a football player so he joined the high school football team (the lady's children, S.J. and Collins, are going to that school. So she could meet that guy.) <TR>So</TR> he became a famous person because that family helped him a lot. <TR>And</TR> the lady knows the truth about Michael, that he is from the Heart Village and that his mother does drugs seriously, and she had a shock about his childhood. His family tries to enter him in the Mississippi college, and the other woman tells him, what if they sent him there to use him for these benefits, so he misunderstands, but it's solved.
OK now your question is, why I did I say this movie took away my stress? I have many stresses about studies, and physical activities. <TR>Because,</TR> I'm not the best like one year ago. <TR>But</TR> Big Mike had no hope. Think if your mother does drugs and doesn't cares about you. It would make you think, ""Why am I here?"" You are not good at studies, you have no place to sleep, and everybody ignores you because you are a poor black guy. It might be really terrible. 
<CO>I always felt sad about my situation. <TR>But</Tr> what about Big Mike? He must have been very lonely until he was adopted by a warmhearted family. I'm a lot happier than Big Mike. There is no reason that I should complain. He is kind even though his situation is like that. <TR>So,/TR> I will begin to change my opinion about my situation. I'm a happy girl. If you are complaining yourself, then ask to yourself if your mother does drugs, if you don't have a home, and if everybody ignores you. It will fix your face like this (-: I'm happy because everything can be possible if I try and smile.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Why not discuss the implications of racism?

Okay hi!
I don't feel good these days. I have a frog in my neck. <TR>And</TR> I don't know why I don't want to go to school. I don't know. I always make somebody happy and laugh many times and there are no problems with my friendships. But why?

K, lets chill out. Because I'm going to write about a happy thing that makes me happy.

Did you see the news about the Chile miners? They were rescued. Okay don't cry. <TR>Because</TR> it is an impressive story.

<SR>I prayed for God to give them a Christmas miracle. <TR>And</TR> now they have been rescued. God has listened to my prayer.

The world had given them a lot of attention, even though they were 700m deep underground. <TR>And</TR> now they have been rescued, <TR>But</TR> I think they are in much more danger now than they were underground. Many programs want them to attend their show, saying that they will give them 1000 million dollars. <TR>And</TR> people ask them if they could write a book about their experiences, and make a movie about that accident. Frankly if it was in the movie theater it would probably be a bit hit. This one great accident made them famous in a positive way. <TR>But</TR> in a negative way they could become haughty and only think about money.

<TR>Maybe</TR> cause I am a pubescent girl who has pimples on her face. (<TR>But</TR> some girls think that I am pretty. And plus, I'm a lady.) I learned it in class. If you are going through puberty you will experience of complicated things 1 million times a day.(In my case, 2000 million a day.)

I'm not saying this <TR>because</TR> I want you to call me smarty pants. <TR>Frankly,</TR> I used to be the kid who studied best at my school. I was the best in arts, physics, etc. I was good at P.E. since first grade. <TR>But</TR> not studying. I wasn't that great until fourth grade.

I knew that there were lots of students who studied much better than me. <TR>But</TR> though this was a fact, I didn't want to lose. I felt that strongly.
I'm not the kid who studies best in my whole school anymore. <TR>At first,</TR> I didn't want to believe this but this is reality.
<TR>In my class</TR> there is a girl who studies the best in our school. Sometimes I was jealous. <TR>However</TR> I realized my real feeling was anger toward myself. <TR>But</TR> I know three things for sure about this girl.

I'm not where I was a year ago. <TR>But</TR> I'll try to get my seat again. <TR>But</TR> I'm certain that some day, and somehow I'll be the best again. <TR>Because</TR> I have experienced a lot of hard and cold times. <CO><TR>But,</TR> I studied forward like a cow in the meadow.

Ulakawakawaka uuu. HaHa why am I saying this strange word? <TR>Because</TR> it sounds like a miracle. What is that face. You are looking at me like you think that I'm a crazy teen who has a dodo brain, mistake of a science experiment. (OK the real thing is my sister is singing right behind me. You should give a face to my sis, not me. Ok now it's making me crazy. Can you excuse me for a second? -------- >> Hey yo kid, just get out of here. I'm working, kid. And don't cry.)

Did you see any articles like these on the news? ""33 Miners in Chile Miraculously Survive for About One Month"" or ""Oil Drill Could Provide Faster Solution for Reaching Trapped Miners"" or ""Somber Independence Day for Miners' Families."" 

This situation is known to many people all over the world. <TR>Because</TR> it's hard to live for one month at 700m deep under the ground. It's a miracle too. <TR>But</TR> the important thing that got all the attention, is how did they live.

I saw a program that analyzed this situation. Our family learned lots of information and lessons with lots of surprises.
<TR>First of all</TR> they could live because there was underground water. <TR>So</TR> they could live. You know by only drinking water you can live for one month or more. <TR>But</TR> the real fact is the second reason. They had a great leader who formed systematic groups where one group was two people, <TR>and</TR> they had to care for each other. I forgot the leader's name. <TR>And</TR> they had a positive mindset that they could be rescued in some days.
In the video they were all smiling. I couldn't understand. I am a positive girl but even I couldn't stand to be positive in a case like that. Think about it: it's dark and there's lots of dirty sand <TR>and</TR> you can barely see; there's nothing to eat <TR>but</TR> a cracker amount for one person. <TR>Recently</TR> I saw a program where people were controlled by a situation. Like Stanford University's experiment of acting like prisoners and policemen. They could have been controlled by that situation. <TR>But</TR> their leader and the systematic group and their positive thoughts helped them to overcome the situation.

<CO><TR>Now</TR> that the thoughts about how they are dead have turned upside down, and the world knows they are alive, there is a lot of work being done to save them. <TR>But</TR> there is a problem. The problem is they are about 700 m beneath the ground. To save them they must make a hole to drag them up. <TR>But</TR> the process of this work is dangerous to the 33 miners. The rocks and the sand can break up easily, and they could be killed if things become worse. <TR>And</TR> it would take 3 or 4 months to finish the hole. <TR>Now</TR> they provide support through a pipe named Pigeon. <TR>Like</TR> meals or shampoo or medicine. <TR>But</TR> they only eat two little spoonfuls of sardines, milk that is half of a normal glass, and one cracker. I hope they can return to their families by christmas. God here is my prayer. Please let those 33 miners have a Christmas miracle with their families. Think of a newborn baby named Hope in English.

<EV>Talking with my best friend in the cool autumn breeze</EV>

Jambo (means hello in Kenya)!
It's nice it is cool now. It got cool suddenly this week didn't it? 
<TR>After 2010 summer</TR> I started to hate summer. Maybe because of the global warming it was very hot. At our school I thought I was in the Sahara desert. I thought I was dying. <TR>And</TR> the air conditioner was broken. (Pretty bad thing in the summer, huh?) <TR>But</TR> now I don't care whether the air conditioner is broken or not. <TR>Because</TR> the autumn breeze is very cool.

It was Friday evening. <TR>And</TR> I came back from the mathematics academy. (I don't go to the academy much. Just 2 days for 2 hours.) The cool breeze made me feel super-duper good. Then my ma told me that my favorite friend, 환희, had called me. I felt so good. Many of my elementary friends had gone to a near enough middle school to contact me. <TR>But</TR> my friend 환희 had moved far away. <TR>So</TR> we didn't have a lot of chances to see each other.

<TR>So</TR> I called her with delight. We both were so happy, like kids in a candy store. It was wonderful that I was talking to my friend. <TR>But</TR> most of all she told me some news.
<TR>Well</TR> my friend 환희's father is a pastor and also a missionary. <TR>So</TR> he went to many countries and brought many things back to my friend. <TR>And</TR> she shared things like chocolates with me. Her father was very kind and funny like she is.
She told me she is adopting a sister in Kenya. <TR>Actually</TR> supporting her. This news made me scream. Then she said every year she is going to visit Kenya to meet her sister. That really freaked me out. She told me she wants to go to Kenya with me. I yelled like a kid. It felt like riding a T-express.

I like Kenya. If somebody asks, ""Where do you want to go the most?"" I will answer Kenya. Didn't I tell you that I like Kenya? Why do I like Kenya? <TR>Because</TR> I like animals and there's nature. <TR>And</TR> I like the song 'Jambo'. Many people think that I'm strange, or related with Kenya. I don't know exactly why, <TR>but</TR> thinking of Kenya makes me feel like the sun is rising in the meadow. I like movies like 'Tarzan' and 'Lion King'. Now you can guess why.

<CO><TR>So,</TR> we talked and talked about school friends, middle school, studies, etc. <TR>Surprisingly</TR> we talked for an hour. <TR>But</TR> think about my situation. You can't stop talking if she is your best friend and there isn't much chance to talk with her. I told my parents about going to Kenya. My dad said no, my mom said she will think about it. I hope I can go there. I always wanted to go there. There is a hope of 75%.</CO>

<TR>So</TR> if you fought, then what happened to me? <TR>Well</TR> this time I saw a movie! <TR>But</TR> not in the cinema--in the middle of middle school! (I told you MS is fun!)
This excited me, but most of all my hope had come true. I always wanted to watch 'Heaven Children' <TR>because</TR> I was fascinated by that book! <TR>And now,/TR> I finally watched it in the middle of middle school! Co~ol!
What is the story of this movie? Allie, the brother, fixed his sister's old shoe. Then he went to the grocery shop and put the shoes between the boxes while he was buying potatoes. Then the old man who gathers the garbage thought that the shoes were garbage so he took them. <TR>After</TR> he left the store Allie looked for the shoes but he knew that he had lost them. <TR>As a brother</TR> he told Jara that he lost her shoes. The problem is that those shoes were the only shoes that Jara had. <TR>So</TR> Allie suggested to Jara that Jara should wear his shoes in the morning and Allie would wear them in the afternoon. <TR>But</TR> there were lots of problems. Then there was a marathon contest, and the third prize was sneakers. <TR>So</TR> he signed up for the contest. Than he ran for 3rd but he won 1st.
Is it sad or happy? That was my question too. <TR>But</TR> in the last scene, his father is looking at the two pairs of shoes like he's going to buy them, <TR>so</TR> I think this might be a happy ending. <TR>But</TR> I want to see this movie again <TR>because</TR> after seeing this movie, I felt peaceful and pure like kids playing in a stream. Even though they were poor they thought of each other. I think we should learn from this. We are a wealthy country <TR>but</TR> our love for our sisters and brothers is not better than poor countries'. I like that part when after the marathon in his house there is a well and he dips his foot in the water and the goldfish come to his feet and play. It reminded me of Doctor Fish. I felt peaceful and calm in there. I wish I had a well like that.

<TR>As usual</TR> I like to watch movies. If somebody asks what is my favorite thing to do I will answer number 1 is watching movies, number 2 is watching movies, and number 3 is watching movies. This is how much I love movies. (of course I love to read books too.) Why do I like movies? <TR>Because</TR> I like to imagine something, and see and listen to another's imagination thing. Many kids like to imagine, right? 
<TR>So</TR> I told my ma to watch movies in the cinema every time I saw her. <TR>Then</TR> the result is we're going to 'Landcinema' which is in 용산.(<TR>Actually,/TR> I wanted to watch movies at the sangam CGV or in 용산, <TR>but</TR> my ma decided to go to Landcinema. <TR>But</TR> it's fine with me if we only see movies. Maybe next time.) Me and my sis Dahnu watched Inception, and my ma and my youngest sis Seowu watched Nanny McPhee. My sis Dahnu wanted to watch Nanny McPhee but if she did, I would have had to see Inception alone. I convinced her so she was in. 
We didn't buy any popcorn because it's expensive and not healthy. (The real reason was my mom said if we didn't eat any popcorn, she would show us movies every weekend. Cool, huh?) 
We were in and waited. <TR>But</TR> it was not good then because teens were around us. <TR>But</TR> the movie started in a few minutes. Okay the story of Inception is there is Cobb <TR>and</TR> Arthur who can go through somebody's dream and steal their thoughts. Then Saito the reach man wants Cobb to help his company. He wanted them to go into Fischer's (the owner of a powerful company) mind and plant new thoughts so Saito's company wouldl win. It was totally funny and sometimes made us feel nervous. I was nervous <TR>because</TR> there was Cobb's dead wife who always appears in his working and makes his working unclear, <TR>and</TR> also makes him feel confused. It was totally an action movie and a comedy. The member who works by changing into other people, Eames, thought the old guy was Saito and said, ""Hey you changed again."" ""Who are you?"" 
Then he knew it was not Saito and said, ""Oh, I thought you were my friend."" <TR>And</TR> this part is funny: ""Your friend must be handsome."" I can't write all the funny things in here because there's not much time. <TR>Well</TR> the story of the movie is really complicated like a dream of a dream of a dream of a dream. <TR>After</TR> I saw it I thought this director must be have an imagination library in his head. I can't imagine like that. It's hard. <TR>And</TR> I was confused if this was a dream or real.

"1066&<EV>In my gifted-kid English class, we read a short story named ""The Gift of the Magi.""</EV> There are two characters in this story. A woman and a man. The woman, whose name was Della, had a husband named Jim. She tenderly loved him, and she wanted to buy a beautiful Christmas gift for her husband. <TR>However,</TR> the couple was very poor and she had no money to buy her husband's present. When she was frustrated by that fact, she sat clumsily on the old tan couch and cried until there were no teardrops left in her to cry. <TR>After</TR> she stopped crying, she thought of a beautiful plan. 
Della and Jim both each had a precious gift. One was Della's long, beautiful, waterfall-like hair and the other one was Jim's old, simple watch which his grandfather had given him. Della thought there was only one way to make some money to buy Jim his present. She decided to cut her beautiful hair and sell it so someone could make a wig from it. She did as she thought, and she went to buy a gorgeous watch chain to replace the old strap that Jim had to carry his watch. 
When she got home with a happy face and her present for her darling Jim, she waited for her husband to come and see the present, which would make him happy, too. When Jim came, he was startled by her wife's very short hair. Della was so frightened by her husband's reaction and behavior about her now very short curly hair. 
When Della asked him why he was acting that way (worrying the whole time),he gave Della her Christmas present. When Della opened it, she cried with joy and then burst into tears again. It was a pair of beautiful combs. She was so delighted to have them and gave him his present too. <TR>But</TR> there was no use for it. Jim sold his watch to buy Della's combs. <CO>This situation was rather silly, <TR>but</TR> I think this was true love for each other and I wish I could have their warm hearts too. </CO>",::,4,::,4,::,1,::,4,::,"Ta;l more about the ""True Love"" you think that they share.

"1067&<EV>I am fortunate to have good parents, <TR>so</TR> it is easy for me to identify the qualities that make them good.</EV> These qualities are unconditional love, trust, and respect for their kids.
All mothers and fathers love their children. They nurture them and keep them from harm. <TR>But</TR> not all love is unconditional. Some parents would not love their children if they married someone of a different religion or from a different ethnic group. Some parents would not love their children if they were of a different sexual orientation. <TR>However,</TR> most of the parents in the world love their children unconditionally, <TR>and<TR> that fact makes most of the chidren in the world happy.
Part of unconditional love is trust. <TR>Also,</TR> most parents trust their children to do what is right. They know we would never do anything to hurt them or to disgrace them. They trust us <TR>so</TR> we trust them. We are confident that they would never do aything dangerous or stupid that that would hurt us.
<TR>Because of the fact that our parents love us,</TR> they also respect us. They treat us as individuals. They accept our differences. They do not expect us or force us to be like them. They want us to be our own person. They want us to make our own way in the world, not follow in their footsteps behind them.
Without their parents' love, children would not be as confident as they are now. <TR>And without their trust,</TR> children would not be freed to do what they want to do. <TR>And so on,</TR> on the other qualities and conditions. <CO>All of the children in the world should have such good parents and be happy their whole life.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,This is good.

"1069&<EV>Many movies such as Twilight, Batman, and Harry Potter are so popular that many people all over the world know these movies.</EV> But why are movies so popular?
Movies are popular because people are great watchers. They like to watch other people's lives. They like to live vicariously. <TR>By going to movies,</TR> we can escape from our own lives, and share other emotions, imagining ourselves as someone else, like the main character of the movie we saw.
Most people's lives are not as adventurous or glorious, victorious like the characters' lives in the movies. We do not fight evil characters all day long and go back victoriously to our lovely, luxurious, big houses or apartments. We just live ordinary lives, going to school, studying, or working all day long and getting back home exhausted and tired and going to sleep right away. We all want to have a little bit of excitement in our lives and we find that in movies and feel satisfaction. Humans are very emotional. We all like to cry and laugh and share other people's emotions whenever we can. <TR>Fortunately,</TR> there is not much to cry about in my life, <TR>so</TR> I like to go see some sad movies where my heart strings can be tugged. I also like to go see some comedy movies, so I can laugh without thinking about anything else.
<TR>Now</TR> I am a middle school student, <TR>but</TR> I know someday I will be a scientist or a politician or a famous model. When I go see some movies, I can see my role models. I see how they act, what they wear, how they walk. I can prepare myself for the day when I will be like them.

"1070&<EV>The one skill I would choose for success is tolerance.</EV> I do not define success economically. I define success socially. <TR>To succeed in the future,</TR> we will need to be tolerant of one another's background, opinions, and lifestyles. 
The world is becoming increasingly mobile; we no longer are able to live and work only with people who went to the same schools and 
went to the same parties as our parents and us. <TR>Now,</TR> we will work directly with people whose backgrounds are completely different from ours. 
We must be tolerant of these differences as they must be tolerant of us if we are to live and work together amiably.
We cannot stop speaking to people or start a war just because there is a difference in opinions. We must learn to be tolerant of one another and respect these differences in opinions. We have to find a common ground, an idea we can both agree on. Once we have agreement on one subject, it will be easier to settle differences in other subjects. Different people have different lifestyles. We must accept these differences even though they may be different from what we are used to. Women can live on their own, hold important jobs, and raise children on their own. Men can stay home and take care of children. Social holes can change and we must be tolerant of these changes.

The instructors tried hard to make us follow the rules, <TR>but</TR> those students were so excited that they acted like they couldn't hear the instructors shouting the rules to them. <TR>Well,</TR> this big episode starts at midnight.

When the morning came and the other room's students woke up, they all screamed. Our friends had drawn very artistic things on their faces! Of course, as you are imagining, everybody in our room that night got a punishment.

"1072&<EV><TR>Nowadays,</TR> some people may hold the opinion that boys <TR>and</TR> girls should attend separate schools, while others have a negative attitude.</EV> <TR>As far as I am concerned,</TR> I agree that boys and girls should attend separate schools. My reasons for this point are listed as follows.
I agree with the statement <TR>because</TR> single-sex education provides an environment for both boys and girls to concentrate on their studies. Research shows that a single-sex school environment can eliminate the distraction from members of the opposite sex, <TR>and</TR> therefore is academically beneficial to students. They will be able to focus more on their academic curriculum, and prepare for their future education and career. The single-sex setting eliminates social distractions and allows for better concentration and academies.
<TR>Next,</TR> traditional gender stereotypes are often reinforced in single-sex academies. Boys tend to be taught in a more regimented, traditional, and individualistic fashion and girls in more nurturing, cooperative and open environments. This will develop their virtues and prepare them for their future roles in society.
<CO><TR>Taking account of all these factors,</TR> we may reach the conclusion that boys and girls should attend separate schools. <TR>Of course,</TR> there are disadvantages of single-gender education.

<TR>First,</TR> you can learn more information about the place from the tour guide, <TR>and</TR> don't have to worry about missing important places.

"1074&<EV>Most students in the world struggle with having so much homework.</EV> Many teachers believe that daily homework is the only key to improving education and school success. <TR>And,</TR> I agree with this opinion.There are three reasons why I agree with this opinion.
<TR>First,</TR> daily homework can reinforce the knowledge that students learned from school. They cannot concentrate on their lessons every day, every minute, and remember every lesson that they learned. I think daily homework is the best way to review what they learned that day, and to study the problems that they do not understand. <TR>And</TR> they could preview the next day's lessons.
<TR>Second,</TR> daily homework is the basis for success in exams. <TR>Well,</TR> this is for students that are not so bright and intelligent. <TR>However,</TR> no matter what the ability of a student, they can improve their ability for study by reviewing their lessons and previewing their next lessons.
<TR>Third,</TR> daily homework can help students to develop learning habits. To learn something is not so much a fun and exciting, enjoyable experience and students always spend a lot of hard time on it. Daily homework can form a kind of habit to learn in an interesting way. <TR>Obviously,</TR> they will be of great benefit to students.

"1080&<EV><TR>Nowadays,</EV> food has become easier to prepare.</EV> <TR>However,</TR> I don't think it has improved the way people live. There are so many people who love eating food and we can't find someone that doesn't like food. It is generally accepted that eating is the most pleasurable thing in life, but fast foods or easy-preparation foods are not good for our bodies.
<TR>First,</TR> we will think about fast foods. Hamburgers, pizza, and fries are the fast food we know about. These are not good though. These foods are so easy to eat and it can be very fast to come out. <TR>Because</TR> it takes only a few minutes to make these foods, very busy people love fast foods. They know that it is not good because there are lots of bad ingredients, for example in the hamburger patty. Hamburger makers have to use clean meat to make pattys. <TR>However,</TR> some people try to make more money and they use chicken's head in the patty. <TR>Well,</TR> it may be nothing to you for tasting it, <TR>but</TR> aren't you a little upset for eating chicken's head?
<TR>Second,</TR> <TR>well</TR>, it's not my opinion, <TR>but</TR> it's a good way of thinking. It's a very great thing about this thing. Easy foods are easy to eat and they may hurt you. <TR>But,</TR> it gives you many chances for tasting other countries' foods. You can eat Japanese or Chinese food, <TR>because</TR> this food is available in local supermarkets. We don't have to go to their country to taste it, we just pick up the easy fast food in another country, like sushi or curry, <TR>and</TR> we don't have to take a lot of time making those <TR>and</TR> we can easily taste the delicious food. 
<CO><TR>As I mentioned above,</TR> there are good things about easy-preparation fast foods and bad things. It's only my opinion about this topic, <TR>and</TR> you could think differently about it. <TR>Well,</TR> I think these foods are bad if you taste it so many dozens of times just because they're tasty.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,1,::,3,::,Are these foods harmful? You begin to discuss it but then move away from it.,//
"1081&Are parents the best teachers? <EV>We have to think carefully about this topic. My parents and I have a very nice relationship, <TR>and</TR> they have supported me so well, <TR>and</TR> I'm very thankful for my parents for everything.</EV> <TR>However,</TR> although they've supported me and done so many things for me, they are not the best teachers.
Parents can be very close to their child emotionally. They always try to teach and scold their children if they do something wrong, <TR>but</TR> some parents don't, <TR>because</TR> they think it's a harsh thing to scold their precious child. <TR>Sometimes</TR>, they even don't scold them if they don't have manners and they have a bad mouth and swear all the time.
<TR>Next,</TR> parents can think and decide that their children's interest is similar with theirs. <TR>Because</TR> they gave birth to them, <TR>and</TR> the child is one of them, they think the child is interested and talented in something because their parents did that too. <TR>Well,</TR> this theory is not so bad. Their child is one of them and his interest and talents may be similar with them too. <TR>However,</TR> parents have to think about their own child and try to find out what the child is interested in and what talents he has. When parents decide the child's own interest and talents, they could go their way until they become older. When they get older, they know that this is not what they want to do, but they just do it and live a very unhappy and upset life, <TR>because</TR> when they were young, parents didn't support the child's interest.
Parents are not the best teachers. <TR>Although,</TR> we have so many teachers next to us, such as our schoool teachers, parents, friends, books, and newspapers. <CO>We have to understand that we have to let them teach what I'm interested in and what I'm talented at. Parents are not the best teachers, they are mentors that support us to beccome nice adults.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,2,::,4,::,Good job taking a side and backing up your opinion.,//
"1082&<EV><TR>Today,</TR> I will talk about this topic: why do people attend college or university?</EV> <TR>Well,</TR> if you graduate elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, <TR>but</TR> do not attend college or university, it's very hard to find a job. <TR>Nowadays,</TR> young people who have just graduated senior high school or college or university think they are just fine for big companies and factories. <TR>So,</TR> they don't want to do jobs like sweeping the floor or cleaning the stairs in big apartment buildings. Let's think about some examples. I said young people don't want to do dirty, dangerous, and difficult jobs. Sam graduated senior high school and he didn't go to college or university. He was very good at everything and he did well while he was a high-school student. <TR>However,</TR> he thought he was so good that he didn't have to go to college or university, <TR>so</TR> he did what he wanted to. When he tried to find a job to earn some money, he had no job for 5 years. Every company and every factory that he wanted to work at just wanted people that graduated college or university. Why? I think it's not very nice to judge a person by his or her grades and education. <TR>However,</TR> the society wants smarter and nicer people. <TR>So,</TR> we attend college or university to be the 'smart and nice person that society wants us to be'. <TR>Well</TR>, it's a pity and I'm very sorry for Sam, companies just can't know about everything about you and they have to know about you through things like grades and education. Imaginate that you are a company's CEO. There are two people, one who graduated high school and one who graduated from Harvard University. <TR>Well,</TR> I think I would choose the one that graduated from Harvard University. He might be very useful, because he had an excellent education at university about what this company does. He will need just a little training about selling something and no more. <TR>But,</TR> if you choose a person that graduated high school, you might need a long time to educate him for your company. However, it's not that he can't work like average people. If he has very good experience related to this work, he will be an Ace in that company. <TR>But,</TR> they are very intelligent and it's more safe for people to go to college or university, <TR>because</TR> it's easier for them to find a job or do what they want. The society has to change, finding more people that are very intelligent, not juding them only by grades and schools. <CO>You have to look into their mind, not just their educational background. If you try to be nice and have patience with finding people that are more useful or intelligent, don't look at their educational background. Find someone with a true mind that thinks.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,1,::,3,::,"Good but why do people value the education you recieve in college?

"1083&<TR>Sorry,</TR> I was so busy this week, <TR>so</TR> I am writing my diary this night. <EV></TR>Well,</TR> I said that my favorite book is 'The Twilight Saga'.</EV> <TR>And</TR> I'm going to talk about this book and explain it to someone who doesn't know this book. Um... where do I have to start.....
This book is more a love story than fantasy or action. There is a vegetarian vampire family, the Cullens, who only drink (or eat) animal blood. <TR>So,</TR> they are living like ordinary students going to Forks High School. But, Isabella (Bella Swan) moves to Forks where her father works in the town as a police officer. Her blood is extraordinarily tasty-smelling, <TR>and</TR> Edward Cullen, who is the same age as Bella, falls in love with her. <TR>Well,</TR> vampires are always so beautiful and magnificent so Bella falls in love with him too, and they just go on dates or to parties. In book 2, 'New Moon', the Cullens have Bella's birthday party at their house and she cuts her hand when she is trying to rip open the present. One of the Cullen family goes out of control, nearly attacking and killing Bella. <TR>That night</TR>, Edward is suspicious and decides to leave her, <TR>becuase</TR> he thinks it would be safer for her if she was away from him and could live her ordinary human life. <TR>But</TR> when Edward calls at Bella's house, her friend, Jacob, answers, ""Chief Swan is at a funeral'. Edward thinks that Bella's dead and he just runs to Italy and pleads the Volturi, the vampire family with strong traditions, to kill him. <TR>However,</TR> Bella finds him in time and he leaves the Volturi. In book 3, 'Eclipse', the vampire named Victoria wants to kill Bella, because the Cullens killed the vampire who was in love with Victoria because he tried to kill Bella and almost turn her into a vampire. </TR>So,</TR> they try to fight with Victoria and her newborn vampires, and they fight with werewolves and they win victoriously. In the last book, 'Breaking Dawn', Bella and Edward finally marry and they go on honeymoon to Isle-Esme, the island that Esme had given them as a marriage gift. <TR>Then,</TR> she realizes that she is pregnant and by risking her life, she gives birth to the half-human and half-vampire baby girl named Renesmee. <TR>Well,</TR> the Volturi tries to kill all immortal children (half vampire) and the Cullens and werewolves fight with the Volturi <TR>because</TR> they want to protect the baby girl. Oh, when Bella was giving birth to the baby, her heart nearly stopped beating and Edward was anxious. He bit Bella and after 3 days of agony like fire was in her body, she became a vampire, like Edward and the other Cullen family. <TR>This time</TR>, too, the Cullens and the werewolves won, and the Volturi just go back to Italy and then, they had peace finally with the loving person next to you. 
<CO>this is the end of the story and there's a movie named Twilight. I think I'm more interested in movies than books, really, because Robert Pattinson is so handsome, <TR>so</TR> it makes me watch the movie again and again. I think you will too, if you read the books and watch the movies. <TR>Well,</TR> I hope you enjoy this book and the movie.

"1084&<EV>My future dream is to become the UN Secretary General.</EV> I thought about my dream when I was in 4th grade, when I heard the news that the 8th UN Secretay General, Ban Ki-moon, became the UN Secretary General. My mom told me about the news, <TR>because</TR> I hadn't decided my future dream yet. The UN Secretary General works at the UN and works for the future of the world. The 15 countries vote for the new Secretary General at the UN. <TR>So,</TR> you have to behave well to become the UN Secretary General. I think so many wars are happening that children, women, men, and all the people are screaming because of the agony of war. War just happens because of the jealousy of people and everything that emotions want. <TR>We have to,</TR> we must get war out and kick it out of the world. Everyone should do that. Maybe some people don't want to do it, like weapon sellers or soldiers who work with wars. <TR>But</TR> think about the past. When people had happily-ever-after lives, when war was nowhere and people asked what war was. Were there any weapons? <TR>No,</TR> they had only tools to live and work with. When science improved and when people needed to kill people, weapons like guns were created. I think it's everyone's duty to protect people because they are their family and friends. It's our duty to get rid of stupid and crazy killing projects. <TR>And</TR> it's what we do at the UN, to keep the world's peace.
<CO>Someone said that if someone asks you about your future dream, don't speak about your job, speak about your dream for the future. <TR>So</TR> if someone asks me about my future dream, I will answer, my dream is to get rid of the crazy wars and live a happily-ever-after life with my family and friends <TR>and</TR> all of the people living in our world. <TR>And</TR> to work with my beautiful dream, I would study hard and behave well to become the UN Secretary General, <TR>so</TR> I could achieve my dream more easily than if I did it all by myself, alone.

"1085&<EV><TR>Last weekend</TR> my family and I went to the ice-skating rink. My sister has been bugging me since she went there with my younger brother two weeks ago. <TR>But at first</TR> I didn't want to go because it would probably be cold there. <TR>But</TR> to be truthful; it was because I was afraid of the mistakes I could make on the slippery ice.</EV>

Like falling flat on my face or even bumping into everyone while they are having a good time.

<TR>So</TR> I tried avoiding my sister who kept on asking and sometimes bribing me with a small amount of money or saying she will give me something that I will appreciate.

Then when she was starting to get tiresome after 2 days had passed, my parents almost forced me to go saying that they will eat lunch out. <TR>Finally</TR> I gave in to my parents and the next day we were off to the ice rink!

Driving there by car, it didn't take long before we reached there.

When I entered the door, we borrowed 3 pairs of skates and started to enter the rink where some of the people were speeding quickly as if they were competing against each other, which gave me butterflies in my stomach for just catching a glimpse at them. <TR>But</TR> my sister pulled me along so I sighed loudly and went in.

It was probably because of the bundled up clothes that I didn't feel cold. I was really scared, almost terrified because it was only a matter of seconds before I start crashing down to the ice.

<TR>Fortunately</TR> my sister let me grip the bars which I assumed were for starters, <TR>and</TR> she guided me toward them.

<TR>Thankfully</TR> I skidded along the gleaming ice and I got a full view of the skating rink. I realized that there were not so many people there as I expected it to be crowded. <TR>Later</TR> I found out that it was because we arrived a few hours early. <TR>As I balanced myself cautiously on the sharp points of the skates</TR>, I found myself moving forward rather slowly. <TR>So</TR> after I put a little more effort into it, I was actually skating on ice.

I think it was easy for me because I used to play outside with roller blades when I was a few years younger then I am. After a few more minutes I felt myself gliding across the ice. When that was finished I rewarded myself with hot cocoa. It was even more tasty than I remembered, probably because of skating around and around the rink for a couple of times.

<CO>Then my mother told me we should get going saying how hungry we must be. I didn't wanted to leave that place mostly because of how much fun we had(and also the tasty cocoa). But my tummy grumbled in protest so we got into the car. While I was thinking in my car about what happened today I came up with a conclusion that I should never judge something before I had even tried it. It is a pretty common knowledge when it comes to trying new food. But I had seldom experienced with a sport so it felt new for me. I should probably test it out with other things too just in case.</CO>",::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,Single lines do not stand alone - combine them into other paragraphs.

"1086&<EV><<TR>Today</TR> I finally got to watch the movie called The Hunger Games.</EV>

<TR>But</TR> I had already read the book version of the movie. When I first saw the title, I thought it was a strange title for a book. <TR>But</TR> it turned out to be the most interesting book I have read in a long time. The time period in the book is the near future in the USA. This story starts with a description of a future society called Panem.

This nation is divided into 13 districts due to the war the citizens in the country had started, <TR>and</TR> there is a city called 'Capitol'. This is where the hunger games began <TR>and</TR> was still going on then. 

Every year Panem selects a random tribute to participate in the game called 'hunger games'. The tribute must be between the ages of 12 to 18. Except for the district 13 they all have to choose a random girl and a boy to participate in the game. The main character named Katniss who lives in district 12 leads the story. <TR>But</TR> her 12 year old sister gets picked as one of the tributes, <TR>so</TR> she volunteers to participate in the game instead of her and the other boy named Peeta gets selected as well.

<TR>To define the game</TR>, hunger games, I think it's a survival game, only the games are happening in real life and participants in the games should be killed all except one person.

It is really interesting and the background of the book is really amazing, to think that the author made it all up. <TR>Another reason</TR> that I couldn't put the book down was that the main character describes the events happening and I could really sink into the book as if I were the girl Katniss in the book. <TR>Also</TR> the changing of Katniss' emotions due to the events that are happening were really interesting to read.

<TR>Furthermore</TR> the detailed inscriptions in the book made it like it was reality making the readers to constantly flip the pages.

<TR>As you can see,</TR> the book was appealing in so many ways, I was tempted to watch the movie and compare it with the original book.

<TR>So</TR> today I downloaded the movie and watched the content of the book move onto the TV screen.

<TR>Personally,</TR> the movie was not as interesting as the book because the detailed descriptions were not there and the narrator was not the girl Katniss. <TR>But,/TR> it felt good to watch all of the characters come to life. It was similar to what I imagined while reading the book. Especially I was impressed by the actor's archery.

<CO>In conclusion, I think it didn't save all the fun things in the book but it was fun enough comparing the book with the movie.</CO>

<SR><TR>But,</TR> I have always known by my experience that a movie based on a book never gets better than the original book so it wasn't all disappointing to me.</SR>

<TR>And</TR> the next movie will come out this November so I have great expectations. <Tr>Plus</TR> the director will change so I will be looking forward to it more than usual, <TR>but no offense</TR> to the former director of course.

"1089&Hi guys! <TR>Last week,</Tr> I wrote about my favorite books which probably would have been very boring... <EV><Tr>So today,</TR> I'm going to write about my favorite movies and American dramas (because my life is so boring I have nothing to write about else.) </EV>

<TR>So,</TR> my favorite American drama is 'Friends.' It ended more than 10 years ago but it's still famous. It's a story about six friends: Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Joey, Ross and Rachel. I love all of the characters <TR>because</TR> each of them has unique characteristics and lifestyles. <TR>But</TR> if I have to rank them, I'll have to say I like Chandler the most. Chandler's main trait is his sarcasm. He makes the most jokes which are usually sarcastic, <TR>and</TR> he used to work at a big computer company, <TR>but</TR> quits and becomes an advertiser. He marries Monica, and they adopt twins. Chandler was acted by Matthew Perry.
<TR>But as I said,</TR> I love every character. Phoebe always says strange things which is hilarious. Rachel changes from being self-centered to caring for her friends. I love Jennifer Aniston (Rachel) who is the most famous of the six people in Friends. Joey later becomes a famous soap opera actor. Ross never loses his obsession to dinosaurs. Monica loves cleaning and always likes to win. 
The second favorite American drama is 'Big Bang Theory.' I only started watching it recently but I love it. The characters' names are a little confusing, <TR>but</TR> I like Sheldon who is a genius but frets over little things. I love the title song which ends like 'but it all started with the big bang BANG!'
<TR>Next</TR> is Hannah Montana. I love Miley Cyrus, and I love the songs in Hannah Montana. It would really be fun to be a famous pop star and be an ordinary student at the same time.
Then it's Modern Family. I like Luke who is like his father; while others ask 'Why?' Luke asks 'Why not?' 
I also like Victorious. I love the songs. I think Ariana Grande is really talented. 
I can't think of any other sitcoms... :) 

<CO>Vacation's almost over. This weekend, I'm having a sleepover at my friend's house which is in Suwon, where I used to live. I'm really looking forward to it. I just can't wait... I hope you guys are spending a great vacation too! :)</CO>

"1090&Do you like reading? Do you go to the library often? If you think you are a bookworm who can't live without books, (By the way, I can live without books.) join me with this talk about 'books.'

<EV><TR>Firstly, I'd like to talk about How to Kill a Mockingbird.</EV> <TR>But</TR> it's not related to actually shooting mockingbirds. Mockingbirds symbolize innocent people who do no harm to the society. The prosecutor (also the narrator's father) says never kill a mockingbird. The author talks about a few ""mockingbirds"" that die with no reason. The part where there was a trial whether the black man was guilty or not was really interesting and fun to read. <TR>But</TR> it was sad to see such discrimination between the blacks and the whites.

<TR>Now</TR> I'd like to talk about The Catcher in the Rye which I just finished a few days ago. This book was also fun to read (I can't read boring books). The story is about a boy who lives by himself for two days after he gets kicked out by his fourth school. In the middle of the story, the boy, Holton, says that he wants to be a catcher in the rye who catches children who are falling off the cliff. I think he is trying to say that he wants to guard children's innocence, which he believes he has lost. He loves his little sister, Phoebe a lot and tries to protect Phoebe from losing her innocence. Holton goes back to his normal life and he ends the book by saying he misses his friends in his school. You should read this book.

<TR>Thirdly,</TR> I love the book Goose girl. This is a fantasy series and I read this book more than three times. Isi has a power to talk to animals and control wind. Enna can control fire. Rin has the ability to control people by words. It's so cool. The author is Shannon Hale, and other Shannon Hale books are great too. <Tr>So</TR> if you have a chance, read One Thousand Days and Princess Academy.

I also remember this book I began reading since fourth grade. It's called Warriors. The author makes a world of cat warriors and the cats are just like humans. There's about 30 books in the Warriors series and it's totally worth it! <Tr>But</TR> if you finish the series, you will probably begin to talk to cats which look really stupid. 

Other books I want to recommend if you are a young elementary kid: Maniac Magee, Fudge series, Ramona series, Hoot, Little House series, the Unfortunate Events series, and many others...

If you are really really young: the Magic Tree House series, the Arthur series, A to Z series, Junie B. Jones and many others.

If you like fantasies: Eragon, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Mysterious Benedict Society.

<CO>I'm going to end here. My friends are coming to play. Oh! Do you like any singers or groups? I love One Direction now. I downloaded all of their songs. I love them.

The second round was the girls' turn. <TR>But</TR> Class 11 was stronger than we thought!! We didn't get a chance to score. I hated the girls in Class 11 soooooo much.


The third round was the boys' turn again. Nobody scored.


We lost the game 2:0. Everyone was surprised. We thought it would at least be 2:1.

"1096&Hi guys I'm back >_< 
<EV><TR>Today,</TR> I'd like to talk about the NLL(Northern Limit Line.)</EV>
<TR>Now</TR> the SaeNuri Party has demanded the transcript of the 2007 summit between the President No and Kim Jeong-il. <TR>During the meeting,</TR> they discussed an idea of making a peaceful cooperation zone. 
I disagree, because that part of the sea is ours!!! It's almost like giving up our own territory. <TR>And</TR> it can be a big problem if the relations between North and South worsen... 
<TR>So</TR> what is this news telling us? For North Korea, they don't consider boundaries. They don't have any boundaries. <TR>Sometimes</TR>, North Korean fishermen come to South's seas. South gives a warning. <TR>On the other hand</TR>, if South Korean fishermen go to North Korean seas, they die. North Korea knows that South Korea doesn't have navy power. Japan has the strongest navy power, and the reason that the U.S is powerful is <TR>because</TR> the U.S has air power, navy power and army power. Israel's air power is also great. <TR>But</TR> all we have is army power. If we were powerful, maybe North Korea wouldn't have been much of an issue. It's just sad that our country doesn't have such powers. 

My test is next week, and I hope I get a good grade!!! So study hard guys, and I'll see you next week.

<TR>Also,</TR> I made a friend from Turkey through penpal!! Did you know that the Turkish people like Korea a lot? They know almost everything about Korea. My friend can write and read Hangul!!!!

She liked to play. <TR>After school,</TR> she always ran to the playground and played with her friends until dark. 
She went to a piano academy and she was one of the top students. She wanted to be a pianist. She read a lot of books <TR>but</TR> she didn't study for her tests. That was Sarah's life until she was in 3rd grade. 
Then her life changed when her family moved to Seoul (she used to live in Suwon.) She didn't like it there. She had to make new friends and meet new teachers. When she started 4th grade, she met a great teacher. Sarah liked her and she liked her class. She still played after school, but she began studying for tests. She was very happy.
When she became a 5th grader, she began studying more. She worked hard and she loved her teacher. 
When she was in 6th grade, she became quiet. She no longer played after school, but she studied and read books. She went to ILE, an English academy, and learned a lot. She met a teacher named Julie. Julie gave Sarah the book, ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" when Julie left the acadmey.
Then she became a middle school student. She still went to ILE and met a cool teacher named Jason. He was nice to Sarah and Sarah always laughed at his jokes. She also went to a math academy. 
<TR>A year later,</TR > she became a second year student in middle school. She went into Lex Kim instead of ILE. It was hard. She always learned how to get great test scores and how to excel at tests. But Lex Kim was different. She began to think about her future. She wanted to be important. She wanted to do something for her country. She began to look at the world around her. The head teacher told her about opportunities, hopes and, dreams.
<TR>Meanwhile,</TR> her math teacher told her she had talent. She wanted to believe that. But there seemed to be so many students who were greater. She was easily depressed. 



<CO><TR>Now,</TR> the girl wonders whether her story will have a happy ending. <TR>Sometimes</TR> she wants to relive her past again to be better and to fix her mistakes... She wants to be stronger and more confident...

<TR>After</TR> my friends and I watched a performance called 'Follower', we went on the scariest looking roller coaster. I felt so nervous as I got on the roller coaster and it was both exciting and frightening. The coaster went up very slowly, but then I couldn't see the next rail and we began falling! My heart felt like it stopped, and I couldn't breathe! <TR>Then</TR> the coaster headed up then down then up and it began spinning! I really thought I was going to fall out! It was really thrilling as the coaster began tilting a lot. I closed my eyes and screamed as hard as I could during the entire time and I held my friend's hands really tightly!!! It felt really good when the ride ended and I was proud of myself.

The second roller coaster was crazy. When I was riding upside down, my head went down and I couldn't lift my head. It was better that way. I liked it when the ride ended.

<TR>Then</TR> I rode the water coaster. I was soaked but it was cool. The slide was really scary!

I didn't go on the vikings ride. The viking ride was not worth it. 

<TR>Then</TR> I got on a ride which rotated and went up and down. It looked fun, but it was horrifying! My friend and I almost screamed to death!! It was fun :)

"1110&<EV>Hi! Because my life is so boring and I have nothing to say, I would like to talk about North Korea.</EV>

<TR>Before</TR>, many analysts and officials have suggested that North Korea will eventually give up its nuclear weapons for a package of economic and other incentives. The harsh language used by the North, some say, was just a ploy to maximize the price of the package. <TR>But after</TR> North Korea identified itself as a nuclear power in its Constitution and after its nuclear test last month, a growing number of people are saying that they now believe North Korea has no intention of giving up its nuclear arms, and determined to go the way of countries like Pakistan. I agree with these people and believe that the North is actually planning to attack the South. 
<TR>For now</TR>, the United States are assured that the North's nuclear missile won't fly as far to reach them. <TR>And</TR> the United Nations Security Council is just imposing more sanctions, which only made North Korea declare that they will no longer speak about dismantling its nuclear program. 
I hope Kim Jeung Un will get more sense and stop all this nonsense. Do we really need a bloody fight right now? We should find ways to unite the two Koreas, not try to destroy one of them. If we unite, Korea will be a much more powerful and wealthy country. We should be ashamed of ourselves for being the only country that is separated! 
I wish all of the tension between the two Koreas will end soon without even a drop of blood...

"1113&<EV>Today I went to the movie theater with my friend to watch ""Les Miserable"".</EV> I had recently watched ""Hobbit"" so I wasn’t planning to go to the movie theater again so soon. <TR>But</TR> all my friends would talk about was about ""Les Miserable""! <TR>So</TR> my friend and I, who were the only ones who didn’t watch that movie, decided to go for it. 

The movie started at 8 30 so we decided to meet at seven o’clock, but my friend overslept and was late. My mom drove us there, but it was past 8: 30 when we arrived at Coex. We didn’t know exactly where the movie theater was in that big department store, so we kind of ran all over the place. <TR>And</TR> when we found it, we bought some popcorn and drinks. 

We were very anxious that the movie has already started, but when we bought the popcorn, there was no one in front of the theater that were supposed to take our tickets and let us in. <TR>So</TR> we waited, not knowing what to do. We stomped our feet, and yelled (there was nobody there) angrily as every minute passed. <TR>Then,</TR> some people came and they also waited, but they lost their temper and pushed the poll that was blocking the opening and just went inside. We didn’t know what to do, so we did the same. I was very worried that the CCTV might have caught us sneaking in, without handing in the tickets, but I soon forgot about it.

The movie was fantastic! I really liked the songs. <TR>So</TR> as soon as I went home, I searched and memorized the lyrics. The best song is ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" The lyrics go like this: ""Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men. It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again. When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums, there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes—

<TR>So</TR> many famous actors were in the movie such as Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, and Russel Crowe. The movie was like a musical, and the actors never talked: they only sang. <TR>And</TR> their voices were so good! I knew they were famous actors, not singers. <TR>And</TR> I later found out that the actors sang it live as they acted, which was the first time in movie history. 

The movie is about a man, Jean Valjean, who goes to jail because he stole some bread. When he runs off, he decides to be a better man, and becomes the mayor of a city. There, he meets Jabe﻿rl who is searching for Jean Valjean. <TR>Then,</TR> he finds out that another man who looks just like him, is caught, so he goes to the court and declares that he is Jean Valjean, but escapes safely. <TR>And</TR> he promises to raise Pantin's little child, Cosette, and he raises her well. <TR>But</TR> when she grew up, she falls in love with Marious, and Jean Valjean saves Marious from the French army in the August Revolution and lets Cosette marry him. <TR>Also,</TR> he saves Jaberl, who kills himself later. <TR>After that</TR>, he goes to the church, and with Pantin (who died) guiding him, he closes his eyes and goes to heaven.

At the end of the movie, I just couldn't stop crying. When the little boy in the movie died when the French Army shot him, I actually flooded the theater. <TR>Moreover</TR>, I was really touched, and wanted to be like Jean Valjean, who cared about others before thinking of himself, and I felt really selfish compared to him. <TR>And</TR> the movie made me wonder, if I were him, would I have made the same choices? Would I let Cossette marry Marious? Would I be ready to let go of a person I cared about so much? <TR>And</TR> would I save a person who had been my enemy?

There was alot of popcorn left so we began eating outside and we had this remarkable idea of mixing the cola and orange juice ﻿that was left.

I first heard about it when I was watching a soccer game. I wanted to watch Gu Jachul play, so I had to watch the Queen Park Rangers play. It was funny. A player who had white hair and dark skin played strangely. He was always in an offside position. I wanted to watch Park's outstanding playing. I think he did a great job. 

<TR>Anyway</TR>, there was a break during the game. I surfed the internet, then I read information about the typhoon. This is going to be a big typhoon. I'm nervous about it. If anyone is hurt by this typhoon, who's fault will it be? We can't blame nature. I think that it will be a tragedy. 

<TR>Also</TR>, I heard some depressing news about Dokdo. Many foreigners think that Dokdo is Japan's land. That is a mistake. In the ICJ, the court will probably be in favor of Japan. <TR>But</TR> Dokdo is a Korean island. <TR>First</TR>, Dokdo is much closer to Korea than Japan. In that past to now, it's been hard for Japan to rule over it. <TR>Second</TR>, in historical books, they say that Korea ruled Dokodo before Japan for more than hundreds of years.

I couldn't do anything because of the Olympics! <TR>Now</TR> I need some sleep. In my academy, I was busy sleeping. Ha......... I was so lazy. If the Olympics were held in a nearby country, I wouldn't have been such a zombie. 

I'm very tired, I need much more effort to keep my eyes open. Plus, I have a headache. It is a miracle that I am even writing this diary entry. It was torture when I had to solve some math problems. I wasn't able to concentrate on the math problems. <TR>In conclusion</TR>, my vacation was ruined because of the Olympics. 

<TR>Anyway</TR>, our Korean athletes are great, especially Yang Hak-seon. His parents are poor, but he overcame his circumstances. I respect him. I want to learn to have his passion. I almost forget about Jang Mi-ran, a weight lifter. <TR>Although</TR> she didn't win a medal, she did a great job! She had a traffic accident, so she couldn't even train. She is my champion. 

<TR>But</TR> there was also a sad incident. One of our soccer players picked up a sign that said, ""Dokdo is our island"" (in Korean). <TR>Because of</TR> this, Japan accused him and he couldn't win a bronze medal. This might not seem that important, but in Korea, men have to go to the army for 2 years. <TR>Except</TR>, sometimes there are special exceptions. Winning a medal during the Olympics would count as one of those exceptions. <TR>However</TR>, he didn't win a medal so he might have to go to the army. Miserable things can also happen....

He was just thinking about his own profits. He is unconscientious and he can't be a judge. <TR>Also,</TR> Jo Jun-ho's game was fun to watch. The Spanish though they could win a gold medal, but because of him, they couldn't.

I believe it's Korea's power. If we're strong and have a lot of money, then they even can't think about these circumstances. Jo Jun-ho did a great job, and everyone will remember him. 

<TR>However</TR>, I felt once again our women's archery is the best. They did a great job!! We won against China with only a 1 point gap. I'm very proud of them. Which countries can win seven-gold medals consecutively? They are the world's best archers. I expect that they'll do well today.
Ah, the Korean soccer team won against Switzerland. A Swiss soccer player was not very nice. Park Ju-young an another player I can't remember, saw him instantly and then he tumbled. <TR>Although</TR> the Korean player got a yellow card, I think it's one of the funniest things I watched.☆

Yeah, that was my complaint. <TR>However</TR>, since the end of my final exams, I have continued to have peaceful days.

I didn't want to come to Haebyungdae. I wanted to go to the countryside and eat a lot of food. <TR>But</TR> sadly, I couldn't. My friends wanted to go to Haebyungdae. Haha.....

<TR>Now,</TR> I feel very uncomfortable. I'm very nervous and embarrassed. I studied English with my friend, and then I suddenly realized that the exam is only 10 days away. She didn't care about that, but I was surprised and my mind is full of regret.

I haven't done anything yet. I need to prepare for it, but I can't. <TR>For example,</TR> I need to study from p.70 to p.150 for the exam, but teacher only taught us until p.110. <TR>So</TR>, I'm anxious about that. I have to study hard for the final exam, they are more important than the midterm exams.

I have another reason why I'm nervous. I went to the math academy today. There is a girl who doesn't like me. She suddenly hit me without any reasons. I told her not to do that, but she ignored it. She always tries to do whatever she wants to. It didn't hurt much, but this made me feel really bad and I couldn't do anything about it. I don't like people who aren't polite. She stops me from studying for the exam.

In Korea, we score everything in a difficult way. We calculate our score exams and achievement. <TR>For</TR> the achievement part, we have to concentrate in class and do well on tests. We take many tests in addition to our midterms and final exams. 

I saw some news. It's about a poor area. An American school made the rules like ones in Korea, and the students got very good scores. What's more surprising, they were from a very poor area. <TR>But</TR> I don't think the Korean educational system is good. It is killing students. Students can't ever make a mistake. <TR>For example</TR>, if you think you do well in math, you think that your score should be a 96. <TR>But</TR>, if you make a small, simple mistake, you score will be dropped to a 92. If you make any other mistake like that, you will have a terrible grade. There are so many students whose scores are 93,94,95,96........ You have to compete with them. You can't cooperate with your friends because they are also your competitors.

"1121&Steve Jobs.
<EV>These days, I'm reading Steve Jobs' biography.</EV> This book is so long that I estimate I will need 7 hours to read it all. I'm so amazed by his creative thoughts, enthusiasm, and passion for perfection. These are the qualities that helped make Apple so successful. 

His parents are not his biological parents. He was adopted by Paul Jobs, his father. The books says that he was greatly impacted by the fact that he was deserted. He was a genius. He solved high school math problems when he was only in the fourth grade. His personality was also very special. He could be very social and friendly, but he could also treat people very rudely. He founded the computer companies Apple and NeXT. 

You know what? Steve Jobs made the movie ""Toy Story."" When Jobs was expelled by Apple, he founded PIXAR. He made a lot of movies like ""Toy Story"" with Disney. I was so surprised by this. I didn't think that Steve Jobs would make animated movies. <TR>Of course</TR>, he didn't do the drawing or painting, but he was still involved with the animation. 

As you know, Steve Jobs became the CEO of Apple in 1997. He saved Apple, which finally started to make profit again after Steve Jobs returned. He made surprising things. I remembered when the iPhone was first released. He helped change our lives, thoughts, and future. Koreans weren't able to use Apple smart phones until 2010.

It is a Korean novel. <TR>But</TR>, like many fantasies, it has an English title. The writer made the world in the novel similar to the Middle Ages. The main difference is that they can use magic. I like fantasies because they always starts with this precondition: It can't be true. <TR>So</TR>, this book also has the same precondition. 

The plot of ""The Second"" is very simple. The first person gets his abilities without any effort. The second doesn't have any abilities. The second tries to beat the first. The second trains, trains, and trains. <TR>However</TR>, he still can't beat the first. Why can't he beat him even after so much effort?

If the author wrote this story about the modern world, I would be even more impressed by it. <TR>Maybe</TR> it can give us hope and challenge us. Oh, don't laugh at me. If the author made this story more realistic, it would be so much more interesting. Most of the fantasies focus on characters like the first person with all of the abilities.

I even went to a DC forum to try and find more information about DD. It was fun, but I'll never go back to the DC forum again. I agree that DC isn't a bad site, but many of the forums have obscene posts. I don't like to go there.

I remembered that, and though to myself, ""Well, I think I did the work with joy, but I couldn't do it with a true heart. I didn't work with people directly. Do I have to have a true heart for books? I'm not sure."" <TR>But</TR> I enjoyed volunteering and I think that's enough.
<TR>Next time</TR>, I'll go to other places to volunteer. I'm satisfied with this. If we always compete, it's going to make our heart not content. <TR>So</TR>, the volunteer system is essential.

The speed of time feels like it is 3*100000000 km/s which is the the speed of light in a vacuum. 
I can still remember the first time I wrote a diary entry. I wrote a review for ""A Book of a Hundred Days"" (or maybe it was a thousand) and I didn't get to finish it... God!!
I never had enough time to write all the things I wanted to share with you like my feelings or special experiences...... <TR>Well</TR>, I wrote about those things in my secret English diary, so maybe I just didn't want to write the same things twice. <TR>Anyway,</TR> that's not the point.
<TR>So</TR>, I still have to write a review for ""The Giver"" and ""The Wednesday War"". 
Ugh, there's so much!!!
<TR>But</TR>, I enjoyed my time writing here, and I want to thank the Little Fox staff for letting me write this diary- it was such a privilege and a nice experience to share my everything with others - especially to the...urm...editors(?) who corrected my diary entries- it was helpful so thanks.

<EV>In Seoul, we had a vote on whether we should have free-meals for school lunch or not.</EV>
<TR>And,</TR> it caused quite a few problems and arguments, with each politician trying to make their stances and claims known. The mayor of Seoul even said that he would resign if the voter turnout turned out to be less than 33.3 percent! As it turned out, he will have to resign now since the turnout was only 25.7 percent. If he doesn't keep his word, he will be blamed by the whole community.
Why did he take such a big risk by making that claim?

Let me talk about other things now.
Politics is such an irritating subject to deal with. There is too much calculation and everyone is trying to get people to agree with their ideas. I guess their heads are always spinning on how to get a better position.

Good news? Bad news?
'Kay, I'll say the bad news first today :
I'm going to school for voluntary hours tomorrow because I almost flunked the science project. I made a Galileo thermometer, and it was a total failure, starting from the formula I used and the pictures of me doing the experiments.
Plus, my Chinese Character homework is not that great either. 
<TR>Well</TR>, I did fine on that homework, but I'm not proud of it. That's because of the problem with my drawing skills. I draw like an elementary school student. I think that's one of the things that I cannot excel in. <TR>Well</TR>, I got an A+ once in my life, and that was because the subject I chose was creative and the original picture was magnificant.

""The Wednesday War' is actually a book that I just ignored a few years before, thinking that the book was lame. <TR>Yet</TR>, when I read it again, I really liked it. The stories were never boring and it even won a Newbery award. It's a real page-turner. <TR>And</TR> even has a Shakespeare quote in the book... Wow! <TR>Also</TR>, I love the author's word choice. He makes everything sound so good when you read the words. <TR>For example</TR> when he says, ""brown, light, perfect cream puffs"", it creates such a good image of chocolate cream puffs, just coming right out of the oven and waiting to be eaten.

<EV>Rain is what matters these days. </EV>
<TR>Well</TR>, I mean, it has been raining for almost three days straight. How much damage did the rain cost?
There were a few landslides and roads were damaged! News reports also said that many people have died, got injured, and are missing. 
It keeps raining, even now while I'm writing this from inside my comfortable home.
I feel sorry for the people who live on low ground level. They are usually poor and can't do anything except to see watch the water damage their homes. <TR>Even</TR> the lucky people whose homes haven't become a huge swimming pool or water tank, water still gets inside and makes all their stuff damp. Many people have to place plastic sheets and other thing to cover their furniture. 
The streets are terrible, too. It's like as if we're walking underwater, with water splashing everywhere. I guess it'll be more convenient to wear raincoats instead of taking an umbrella. It's hopeless to stay dry and you see a bunch of raindrops slam onto your umbrella, and the rain bounces off to your arm or somewhere else they are not supposed to go. Rain boots are a good idea, but it's better if you wear long rain boots and not short ones like mine. The rain pours into your rain boots if they are not tall enough which was my experience. You really don't want to face that kind of problem yourself.
Don't even let me get started on the landslide problem!
It's just terrible. The landslide caused buildings to collapse, which is what happened on Tuesday. <TR>And,</TR> the structure that collapsed was not an empty building: it was a pension!!!
<TR>So,</TR> in the middle of the night, a pension collapsed because of some huge, nasty landslide, and there was a bunch of people in the building! Some didn't make it out alive. Others lived, but were injured physically, or mentally. <TR>And</TR> there are still some people that the search and rescue team couldn't find yet under that huge pile of rubble from the broken building. I was really surprised to hear the news about the building, and also a little ashamed because I was enjoying the rain! <TR>After</TR> such hot and dry days, the rain came, and I was staring out the window, enjoying the cool wind and thunder rumbling and lightening striking across the sky. I even hoped that it would rain all week.

<EV>I have given you my WARNING!</EV>
<TR>So,</TR> if you haven't seen the new Harry Potter movie yet, just click the ""back"" button now.
That'll be more useful for you. 
I really don't want to spoil your fun and excitement.
<TR>Of course</TR>, seeing the real movie will be a lot better than reading my humble review for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" so it won't be good for you to keep reading.
<TR>So</TR>, don't blame me for anything.
I gave you my word: I'VE WARNED YOU!!!









Here we go now then, all right?
<TR>First</TR>, the movie is spectacular. It'll be much better if you watch the movie in 3D.
I didn't watch it in 3D, but if I can, I will go to the cinema again and watch this movie over and over!!!!! I really want to watch it again. 
<TR>Well</TR>, to be honest, I didn't like this series when I was young (I mean, when I was six or seven years old). I first watched one of the movies in the series on TV, and unfortunately, there was some disgusting and frightening scene: a large, slithering serpant attacking, Ron throwing up slugs, and Lord Voldemort's face attached at the back of Professor Quirrell's head......
<TR>For</TR> a six-year-old kid, that was too much!
<TR>So</TR>, I hated the Harry Potter movies for some time while my friends were crazy about it. 
<TR>Then</TR>, I saw ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" and instantly fell in love with the series. 
<TR>Soon,</TR> I realizes that the books are MUCH more interesting than the movie, with more detailed descriptions from its author. I even stayed up all night, reading the fourth book in the series. When I read the final book, I have to admit that I was awestruck at this author's brilliance and even felt a little shudder as I remembered how everything- even the smallest things - fit perfectly with each other. Totally surprising. Movies cannnot follow the book's unique imagination, and at times, there was no description about the backgrounds of some of the scenes. <TR>In that case</TR>, the scene's background must depend on the director's imagination. 
<TR>However</TR>, in some ways the movies are better than the books because they bring the books to life, especially in the scenes with some large-scaled move or attack. <TR>Sometimes</TR>, the director of the movie doesn't rely on the book; but creates his own story, and changes little details. 
<CO><TR>Today</TR>, I'm gonna show you how many things were changed while making the movie, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2."" </CO>

----------------------
( I'm writing this on the assumption that you have watched the first part of this movie, which was released last year. )
Part 1 of the movie ended with Lord Voldemort finally tracking down the unbeatable Elder wand, which had belonged to the previous headmaster Dumbledore, and Voldemort laughing with delight as he grasps the Elder wand and lightning crackles down in the sky.

"1140&Wednesday, June 13. Weather: Thanks to my rain boots, I didn't get wet.

<EV>Exams are finished, and the scores were given.</EV>
<TR>So</TR> now the teachers show us some movies during free time. This is a really good idea, because all the - no, almost all the - students are dreading summer vacation.
You know, having to go to academy after academy. My friend joked around saying, ""Academies are my summer place"" when she was talking about how she will spend her summer vacation. She says she doesn't even want to think about it. Oh, how can one student spend all her time studying???
I mean, we should study what we want to study, shouldn't we? That's why there's summer vacation. To do whatever you want to do. 
<TR>Anyway,</TR> that's not the point.
<TR>During</TR> our English class, my teacher showed us a movie called ""The Day After Tomorrow.""
It is a movie about returning to the Ice Age. Here's the story:
Jack Hall is a paleoclimatologist on an expedition in Antertica with his colleagues, Frank and Jason. They were drilling for more ice samples when suddenly an ice shelf breaks in half and Jake almost falls to his death. Later back in New Delhi, Jack presents his findings on global warming at a UN conference, but nobody belives in him, except for Professor Terry Rapson of the Scotland Climate Research Center. Professor Rapson believes in him, and he tells Jack that the temperature in several places in the North Atlantic simultaneously dropped 13 degrees Celsius below. Jack thinks that the Ice Age is coming, due to global warming. (When the Earth gets overheated, the Earth will try to get everything in control, by cooling down the whole world's temperature. <TR>So</TR>, as the North Poles' ice melts, it will cause a reaction to start the Ice Age again.) <TR>Even though</TR> Jack originally thinks it will take at least a hundred years for the Ice Age to happen again, when his teams builds a forecast model with their combined data, the results show them that it'll take less than that, 6 to 8 weeks at most. 
<TR>Around</TR> the world, the crazy weather system starts to bring mass destruction, such as a powerful hailstrom striking Tyoko, Japan, and a series of devastating hurricanes in Los Angeles, killing thousands of people. Spacemen are able to see a huge storm system spanning the northern hemisphere, which delays their return. Jack's theory about the Ice Age becomes a reality in seven to ten days time.
<TR>Meanwhile</TR>, Jack's son, Sam, is in NYC for an academic competition with his friends Brian and Laura. They also make a new friend, J.D.. The weather in NYC becomes very violent, with all super-power winds and tidal waves that hit Manhattan and cause major flooding which kills thousands of people in the chaos. Sam's friends run to the library, and seek shelter there. <TR>And</TR>, Jack promises his son that he'll rescue him and warns him to stay warm inside and not to go outside. <TR>And</TR>, Jack begins his expedition to New York with Jason and Frank. Frank dies on the way trying to save the others. They continue their way. 
At the library in New York, everyone is leaving the city in an attempt to survive. Sam convinces them that they'll die if they go out, yet very few people listen. The remaining people light a fire and they stay, eating chocolate chips and snacks from the staff vending machine. Things get worse , and Laura is afflicated with blood poisoning, and Sam and the others set out to get some penicillin to cure her leg. <TR>But</TR> soon they are confronted by some hungry wolves, which escaped from the zoo and were hanging out, trying to find food (or even some humans, I think). <TR>And even though</TR> they get caught at first, they successfully return from the hungry wolves. <TR>Soon</TR> and the eye of the superstorm, starts to freeze everything. (You should really watch this scene!!!! It's magnificent, and also scary. The whole city freezes from the top, and the frost starts to creep into the building. It was ironic that humans can escape from 'cold air', since it usually travels by the wind and humans cannot walk OR run faster than the wind. <TR>But</TR> Sam somehow did, even though he was dragging the whole pack of necessary supplies. ) 
<TR>While</TR> Sam was desperately trying to keep warm in the eye of the superstorm, Jack finally arrives in New York with Jason, and finds the public library half-buried in snow. 
<TR>And, finally,</TR> Jack and Sam meet at the fireplace of the library. Plus, the storm clears off causing no more disaster. <TR>And</TR>, hundreds of people who kept warm during the freezing weather survive, and the movie ends with the ISS's astronaut saying that the Earth's temperature has gone back to normal, and that all the pollution is gone. 

It was such a wonderful movie! The scenes were amazing. A tidal wave passing through New York, hurricanes that b;ast everything, mighty storm systems......
I really love movies about catastrophes.There is much to see and learn. <CO>They help make us think about what we should to do to avoid these kinds of terrible disasters from happening. I'm going to try watching ""Volcano"" next time.</CO>

<TR>Anyway</TR>, after the test yesterday, I went to the library. 
<TR>During</TR> my exam period, what I wanted to do the most was read English books.
I have found that English books are easier to understand than translated books.
<TR>Well</TR>, I think it's because no matter how well you translate something into a foreign language, you can't always get the exact feeling of the original book. 
It is just that you cannot always translate the origin's culture and thoughts into a translated book. 
<TR>So,</TR> I borrowed some English books: ""Roman World,"" ""Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix,"" ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" and others. ""Roman World"" is really thick, but I decided to spend my summer vacation studying Romans and Ancient Greeks. <TR>Maybe</TR> if I have more time, I will study and understand the basis of architecture. 
<TR>After</TR> borrowing some books (believe me, carrying some thick books all day without a backpack makes you feel like you won't ever get to use your arm again) from the library, I went to buy clothes. I found a new tee that I really liked, and also some shorts.

------------------------------------
I was in a great hurry yesterday, so I will write today's diary again. 
<EV>Theses days, I'm learning about atoms and compounds.</EV>
I'll review yesterday's lesson.
<TR>Well,</TR> there are a few ways to make compounds but for now, we learned about covalent bonds and ionic bonds. How do I start?....Right.
All atoms have electrons and their orbits, right? <TR>And</TR> except for 'rare gases', all other atoms want to fill their orbits and stay stable. There are two ways to fill their orbits: covalent bonds and ionic bonds. ( <TR>But</TR> don't think there are only two ways to make a compound! There are more. ) 
<TR>First of all</TR>, a covalent bond is characterized by the sharing of a pair of electrons between atoms or other covalent bonds. Take water for example... Yeah, water! W-A-T-E-R, water we drink, water we use, and water we cannot live without. Yeah, water is a covalent compound, made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom!
(Water is amazing! Its unique features keep us and even fish alive. I'd like to explain it to you now, but let's wait until later. I have to explain about making compounds.)
<TR>So</TR>, water's molecular formula is H2O, and that means that water molecules consist of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.Its degree of coupling is 120 degrees each. 
Let me tell you how it happens. <TR>First</TR>, 'neutral' hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron. <TR>And</TR> you know,the first orbit of the atom (closest to the proton) is made when there are two electrons exercising. <TR>So</TR> hydrogen atoms need one more electron to fill their first orbit. An oxygen atom, on the other hand, has eight electrons, and it needs two electrons to fill its second orbit. 
Did I mentioned that nonmetallic atoms LOVE to take electrons, but do not want to give them up? <TR>Well</TR>, now I did. It's really hard to take other's electrons without permission, right? <TR>And</TR> there is no 'left out for free' electrons for them to take. <TR>So</TR> our dear hydrogen atoms (H for short) and oxygen atoms (O for short) meet and negotiate.

O: Hey, H! I need two electrons. Would you mind giving some to me?
H: Are you KIDDING??? I have only one electron! You have eight. Give some to me. I want to stay safe.
O: No way, H, I want to fill my orbit! I don't want to give my precious electrons to you!
H: That's what I'm saying!
O: Well? There must be some way for us to both be satisfied without fighting.
H: How?
O: I've got it! You need one electron, and I need two electrons. <TR>So</TR> you bring one of your friends now,and then all three of us can be satisfied!
H: I don't know what you're saying, but...... Sure.
H's friend: Hi, dear Oxygen? H told me that you figured out a wonderful way to make us all good.
O: Sure, I do. <TR>First</TR>, I'll give you one electron each, and in exchange, you each give one electron to me. 
H: Oh, that's good! I get the one electron I need, and you get the two electrons you want!
O: Let's do it.
(after a while)
H's friend: We changed!!!
O: Yeah, what do we call ourselves?
H: Water. I looked up the dictionary. 

<CO>A little stupid, but I hope this helps you understand more about covalent bonds.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,Use conversation words in your dialogue to indicate emotion or speaker. It isn't a script for a play - it is a journal entry. Get creative.,//

A fight even broke out, and it was because one guy played a trick on the other. 
<TR>Normally</TR>, that would've ended with them laughing together. 
<TR>And</TR> what about teachers?
They don't let us to talk during recess.
Test after test after test...
All twelve subjects' teachers are giving us too many assignments.
Let's stop this conversation.
All of these things are driving me crazy.
The more I think about my exam, the more I become angry!

Do you know how to get rid of these irritating mosquitoes?
This summer, mosquitoes decided to annoy me by whizzing fast beside me. <TR>Usually</TR> when I try to catch one, it hides somewhere that I cannot reach or cannot find until later.
<TR>And</TR> what about at night?
Imagine you decided to sleep. You turn down the lights and turn on the fan so you can sleep without the crushing hot temperature. 
You lie down and try to sleep when . . . buzz, buzz.
<TR>Well</TR>, I'll give you choice: if you get up and try to catch your little friend, you will ruin your sleep. <TR>And</TR> if you get up and decide to kill the intruder, it'll hide.
<TR>And</TR> these days, city mosquitoes are very bold and don't even fly away when there is a fan blowing. They just enjoy the cool wind. Neither mosquito repellent or incense works. They seem immune to it. 
<CO>The best way to keep yourself safe from that little Satan is to set up a mosquito net. 
They haven't developed a way to get through the net so far.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,"Remember, don't begin a new line unless you are starting a new paragraph.

Weather:Time for a review from your science class! Your science teacher must've told you when days are getting longer and nights are getting shorter, it's summer! And I believe the longer the day becomes, the hotter we feel. I'm happy(?) to tell you that today's temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.

<EV>I'm also happy to inform you that my school is improving greatly.</EV>
We finished building a new gym, and we are using it for our P.E. classes.
And guess what?
We now have our new summer uniform!
It is just a T-shirt in a light pink color, and I think it is pretty.
My school started selling the summer uniform yesterday, and I already bought one.
<TR>Well</TR>, it's a little bit big for me, so hopefully, I'll be able to change it to another size.
My Latest News
1. I finally got my prize after 1 month! My teacher kind of forgot that she had to give me my prize, and I finally got it yesterday, after 1 month!
2. I unfairly had my Chinese speaking test today. I had hoped that my Chinese teacher would postpone it!!
3. Ummm... today, some kids from Singapore are visiting our school. I feel sorry for them, because my school is not that wonderful. What's more? They are attending our class, too!!!!

<EV>I'll write the answer to the problem I posted in my last entry.</EV>
(distance that the train runs for 10 minutes) = (gap between two trains)+(distance you walk for 10 minutes)
Distance =Time*Speed
Speed of the train: X
Gap between two trains: Y
10X=Y+40, 10X-Y=40


(distance that the train run for 8 minutes) = (gap between two trains)-(distance you walk for 10 minutes)

8X=Y-40 8X-Y=-40


10X-Y=40
-8X-Y=-40
2X =80
X=40

(Speed of the train)=40km/h

<CO>I guess this answer is correct.</CO>

<EV>Today, we went to the Children's Park to do some drawing.</EV>
It's an annual event where all of the students miss school and go there. 
<TR>Well</TR>, in the morning, I was late and dashed out of the door without even saying ""Bye"" to my Mom, but it turns out that we were not late. <TR>In fact</TR>, we were one of the students who had to wait for our teachers to come.
Are you good at art, especially drawing?
I'm the one who flunks my artwork because I make mistakes with the brush strokes. 
Sketching is fine- if you just draw some thick and thin lines together, and make it dark, everything looks like it'll turn out great.
I drew some trees and a pond with some frog sculpture on it, and a few people strolling by.
I learned some tricks from my friend Jisu, (she's excellent when it comes to artwork) that helped me to fix my too-big-and-fat-tree trunk with a few leaves. I admired her artwork which was all smooth and looked great.
<TR>But</TR> even with her help, and my other friend, YeonJi, lending me some extra paint colors, my brush betrayed me again. <CO>The whole point of going to the Children's Park for me turned out to just eat lunch there.

Weather: It's six in the morning, but it's almost as if the sun has came out already. 
Nights are getting shorter and the days are getting longer. 
And weather forecast says it's the best day to go out. The weatherman said today is a ""perfectly sunny day"" and I really like it. 


<EV>Yesterday, I went to the Nowon Children's Library and borrowed some books.</EV> I'm going to tell you some interesting books or series today.
These days I'm reading ""The Mysterious Benedict Society"" series and ""The City of Ember"" series, and I think both of the series have wonderful books.
<TR>First,</TR>""The City of Ember"" is a bit short, and there are a total of four books in the series. I borrowed all of them execpt for the third book.
Here is the main story : when a catastrophe is about to take place on the planet Earth, the Builders construct an underground city and bring 50 men, 50 women and two babies for each couple. The Builders said that they should forget about their lives above the ground, and to keep their former lives as a secret from their children, so they don't wander around looking for the exit. In the underground city - called Ember - everything seemed perfect with bright lights provided by hydroelectricity and food (from the Greenhouse and storage rooms full of cans)
<TR>And finally</TR>, there is a document with instructions that the Builders left behind to prepare for the time when Ember becomes endangered. The document is called the Instructions for Egress, but it got lost by the seventh Mayor of Ember and no one knows about it.
<TR>Until</TR> Lina finds out and plans an exit from Ember with Doon.
In Lina's time, everything is lacking in Ember. The potatoes are diseased, and there are hardly any cans left for the citizens. Only privileged ones such as food workers and the Mayor have access to food, keeping the cans to themselves. <TR>And</TR> the light that supports Ember is beginning to flicker, and the people of Ember know that they are doomed. There are ""Believers,"" who believe that someone - frankly, the Builders themselves - will come and rescue them. 
When Lina and Doon finally exit Ember through a secret hallway built by the Builders, they realize that their previous world was nothing but a small ball of light deep underneath the ground. <TR>And</TR>, they send the message to the remaining people of Ember, and the story ends there.
There are other cities like Ember in many books. Take ""The Giver"" for example. (It is another one of my favorite books.) Jonas is living in a so-called utopia. The government controls everything: the food they eat, what dreams they have, what feelings they feel, etc. <TR>Since </TR>everything, almost everything, is controlled, they don't even feel anything about killing. The government calls it ""releasing"" and everyone takes that for granted.
<TR>Until</TR>, Jonas becomes the Receiver of Memory, a special person who remembers all of the memories of the past, he doesn't even know anything is wrong. With the help of the last Giver, who gives Jonas all the memories, Jonas learns about everything: colors, wars, real happiness, and about killing.
Too shocked that everyone is ""releasing"" old people and weak babies mercilessly, Jonas leaves the town, thinking of a way to tell the people about real life and real emotions.
<TR>Well</TR>, both books are talking about cities made and controlled by the government. Everything is perfectly controlled, until someone tries to break the control. <CO>Some say when if another World War happens again, and after almost all people die, there could be some country like that.
<TR>Well</TR>, what do you think?</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,What about these books do you like? Can you discuss what you like about the characters? What you dislike about them?,//

Weather: My umbrella doesn't match. I should take the white one instead.

<EV>On my desk, there's a white and pink carnation tied with some pretty ribbon. </CO>
I made it on my own, with paper, glue, and scissors. 
I spent almost an hour making one carnation, and I think it's pretty. 
March is family month in Korea. There are lots of ""days"" which include Children's Day, Parents' Day and Teacher's Day. 
<TR>Well</TR>, this means that I have to spend a lot of time making flowers and writing cards. 
That's fun, though, because the whole process is done in secret.
Gifts are supposed to be a secret, right?
<TR>So,</TR> since Children's Day (May 5) and Parents' Day have passed, all I have to do is prepare some presents for my teachers. 
Who is your favorite teacher?
I have a few teachers I like, my former class teacher (from when I was in 6th grade, elementary school), my History teacher, my current class teacher (who is also my Science teacher) and finally, my Advanced-English teacher, Carlye.
I think all of them are really good, so I'm going to write letters to them. Teacher's Day is this Sunday, and I think the cards should be delivered to them by Saturday. <TR>But</TR>, I'm of two minds on whether or not I should write a letter to Carlye. <CO><TR>Well</TR>, I'm not good at English, and you know, it'll be my first card written in English to a native English speaker.

"1149&Saturday, April 6
Weather: A little bit cold, and rainy.

<EV>Today is April 6th, the day after Children's Day!</EV>
What did you do on Children's Day?
<TR>Well</TR>, I'm not at the age to celebrate Children's Day because I am no longer an elementary school student. I'm a middle school student, and what's more, I'm in my second year!
Everyone thinks that I should be in my home, studying. <TR>But</TR>, that wasn't my intention yesterday. 
<TR>So</TR>, I went to Seoul Land!
I woke up at 5 A.M., got ready to play, ate a real quick breakfast, and went off!!!
The weather was great: not cold, no rain, only warm weather perfect for playing.
The amusement park was not crowded, due to the early time I got there. 
It was the perfect time to play. 
<TR>Well</TR>, some say that you go to Seoul Land to see the other people, instead of riding the rides, but that was not what we did. 
I rode about 6 or 7 rides in an hour, including the roller coasters, Magic Carpet and Goblin's Wind. 
All of them were fun, especially Goblin's Wind (Top Spin)!
You sit on the ride and it twists itself, turning in a full circle and... 
I cannot quite explain it. I wish I could upload some pictures. 
The roller coaster was exciting, too. It circled, twisted, and dived with really fast speed. One bad thing about it was time. It was too short, and all the excitement goes away. It felt as if we would start, twist a little, and ding! It's already over. Thank you.
<TR>And</TR> Shot X Drop was also really exciting. 
The ride shoots up to 52 meters high and shoots back down. I love the feeling of it, like flying. I think the fact that there's no place to put your feet makes the ride more exhilarating.
I'll leave short comments about some more exciting rides.

1) King Viking
You should sit at the end. It doesn't go really high, but if you sit at the end, you'll still feel the thrill of the ride.

2)Flume Ride
Watch out for the camera! It takes your picture when your face is at its most vulnerable. Plus, don't forget to bring some towels! You will be sorry that you didn't bring it. You get soaking wet. 

3)X Flyer
Wanna get the real excitement? Here we go~! It makes you scream. Not scary, yet. <TR>But</TR> don't go too far. I've seen some kids who went too far and...... your opinion.

4) Bumper Cars
Learn to ride your car! I got trapped with others and wasted my precious time. :(
Stress out!!

5) Zeppelin
When you feel like you're tired from all those other rides, try this. It makes you feel happy, tranquil and peaceful. It makes you smile.

6) Rock Cafe
Listening to music, around and around! 

7) Black Hole 2000
The ride twists twice, and there are seven dives! Don't put your glasses on. They can fly away. 

8) Double Loop Coaster
It circles two times, and you don't have to take off your glasses. The centripetal force keeps your glasses from falling off. Plus, you will be able to enjoy the caves with winds and lightning sparking.

9) Motion Theater
I love penguins! This is the story of some penguins. Well REALLY unlucky penguins, starting all their adventures with just one slip. SOOOOOOOO cute!!!!

10) Crazy Mouse
The most thrilling of all the rides. Stress out!
Sorry. That was a complete joke. It's a mini roller coaster for really small kids.

There was a lot more, and I'm sorry I cannot explain them all. <TR>Anyway</TR>, it was really fun.
When we came back home, it was 10 P.M. I just collapsed on bed and today, spent all day sleeping and watching TV. 
<CO><TR>Anyway</TR>, it was a wonderful day, and I'm thankful to my mum for waiting all those times in line for us to play and let us do all this joyful stuff!</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,This is good.

"1150&Friday, April 29 weather: just spring. Not too hot and not too cool.

<EV>Well, did you see the wedding of Prince William and Catherine? </EV>
It was not as grand as I thought it would be (compared to Diana), but everything was still beautiful and sincere. The bride's white dress was nice: not too fashionable, not too luxurious, and not so simple. <TR>And</TR> with simple earrings. 
<TR>Anyway</TR>, what makes her special and stand out was not the dresses or her hairstyle. It was her own self. <TR>Well</TR>, during the procession, she responded calmly to the crowd's cheers and her every action was natural and proud.

Yes, the mid-term test was finished!! Today!
To be exact, it finished at 10:45 A.M. Loud cheers erupted between us, and we loved the fact that the exam was over and we'll be able to play for the rest of the vacation. I'm going to some party where we will eat and celebrate, play games and laugh together. It's going to be really exciting. Sunday? <TR>Well</TR>, for me, my hope is to play around all day, reading books and surfing the internet. (Remember what the weather channel said? It said it's going to be rainy all day during vacation. <TR>Well</TR>, to be honest, going out in rainy weather is totally not a good idea these days.)

Weather: I'm not sure, but I'm positive it's really warm.

<EV>Mid-term tests are coming rapidly.</EV>
<TR>So</TR>, all of us students are really nervous and don't even run around the classroom during recess (this seems crazy, but that's what boys do during recess) or as my Chinese Character teacher puts it, ""Play like they never played before"".
Students like to have study time instead of sitting in teachers' classes, and on the door of the teachers' room, there is a sign that says 'DO NOT ENTER. WE'RE MAKING EXAM QUESTIONS' in big, red, bold letters. 
All of the things about exams are making us more impatient.
<TR>And,</TR> today, I'm going to take an English ""speaking test"". <TR>Well</TR>, we have to memorize the sentences that our English teacher gave to us, such as, ""Where did we build the Great Pyramid? On the west or on the east bank of the Nile river?"" and ""Hojin wanted to talk to the artists at the compamy because he wants to be an artist."" and the teacher will test us. I learned and memorized 30 different sentences by heart. Whoa.


Let's talk about other things.
I don't have to spend the morning sad and blue, thinking about exams, right?
<EV><TR>Well</TR>, I'd like to say that our school is getting nicer.</EV>
There is a new gym, library and cafeteria.
There is already a small garden with benches to sit on and trees to see, which are beautiful 
with loads of flower blooming.
<TR>During</TR> our winter vacation, our outer wall was cleaned and painted, and the school gate is also beautiful! It is white with a pretty shape.
That is the good side of our school. 
About the bad side, let's hear what my frends are saying.
""Why don't they repair the bathroom? The bathroom is the one that needs new repairs. <TR>And</TR> also the school lockers and chairs.""
<CO>""They should solve the school's inner problems first, not the outer problems.""

It's April, and April has a magic power to bring the spring beautifully.
White cherry blossoms are decorating the sky, and bees are joyfully following the scent of the spring. (I used to see drones fly when I was young, but I cannot see them now. They look like bees, but they are not dangerous, with no poison, and really meek.) I can't see the butterflies yet, but I hope to see them soon.

"1154&<EV>I got really tired after the camp, so I just ignored this.</EV> <TR>But</TR>, since I said that I would write about my camp experience, I'm keeping my promise.
The camp was good. Except for the fact that we couldn't enjoy our time on the bus because it took only half an hour to reach the place. It was annoying. We seem to complain about a long bus ride, but we really enjoy the talk and cookies on the bus.
<TR>Anyway</TR>, when I first got out of the bus, and saw the sight of the camp, my first impression was ""Wow."" It seemed nothing like a camp place. A silver, sophisticated building stood there and it was beautiful and brand-new. Guided by the camp's staff, we could see our apartment, the place we were to stay during our time in the Song-am Space Center. In our 'room', there were two floors, and on the top floor, half of the ceiling was glass. The glass was transparent so we could see the stars shining when we lay down. I have never seen anything like that. It was magnificent. 
As soon as we put down our bags and gathered together, the teachers divided all of us into two group and started the activities. I was in 'A' group, so the first part of my program was drawing glow-in-the-dark celestial map. I was a little disappointed by the result because all I could do was to mark the sites of important stars, such as Sirius, Polaris and Altair. It was boring, and teachers didn't let us take the activity paper we made. It was really annoying. I wanted to put it up on my room and enjoy the glowing of important stars. <TR>After that</TR>, we saw a 3D-movie. If it's supposed to be a 3D-movie, you should wear some sort of special glasses or the screen will be all blurry. <TR>But</TR> this was nothing like that. Do you know about planetariums? 
A planetarium is a theater that is shaped like a hemisphere, and you go in and ""sit."" (Even though, ""lay down"" is more accurate, you cannot say that you laid down on the chair. It seems ridiculous.) The screen is also hemisphere-shaped and when you look at it, it feels so real. It's much nicer than a regular 3D-movie because you don't have to wear those glasses, and a regular 3D-movie doesn't make you feel like you're a part of the scene that is playing on the screen. <TR>Anyway</TR>, it was good. 
<TR>Finally</TR>, dinner time!!! Dinner was chicken steak and french fries and rice. It was delicious.
<TR>But</TR> they seemed to forget that we needed salad. <TR>Well</TR>, they can't give always gives us everything we want, can they?
<TR>After</TR> dinnertime, we had a little recreation time and went to sleep. You know what? We stayed up untill 3 A.M, eating snakes and talking, surfing the internet, and whatever. I cannot say that I was totally fine the next morinig, but hey, it was fun, especially with seniors entertaining us with jokes. 

The sky was blue, and the air was cold. Everyone's breath froze in the air in the morning. 
<TR>After</TR> breakfast, we did the ""Challenger"" program. Remember the unlucky space shuttle, ""Challenger?"" Yeah, it blew up in the air while launching. <TR>And</TR> all of the crew members died. <TR>And</TR> their family made up this program as a memorial or something. I'm not sure. <CO>The time was running out, and all we could do was quickly tour the installation. </CO>

The new computer is surely nicer than the old one in every aspect: speed, icon, computer background, program, Window, memory... sorry, but I cannot even remember all of them. Oh, the computer storage capacity on the new computer is the best. My previous computer's storage capacity was only 320GB, but the new one holds 500GB. That means more room for movies or programs. It's cool.
<TR>And</TR> the design is great. Desktop's design is called 'rising sun' or something similar to that. It's decorated with reddish lines and it looks luxurious, fitting perfectly into the living room. <TR>And</TR>, it has a flap on the left side, so that when you lift it up, you can see the USB ports, SD card ports, MS card port and others that I cannot remember. <TR>Above it</TR>, there's a small, round button that makes the desktop open the CD/DVD player. I can write CDs or DVDs in addition to playing them. 
I also got 2 mice, 1 wireless mouse, a keyboard, a set of speaker, USB 4G*2, and a headset as freebies. Wi-Fi Sharing is going to deliver everything to us this week. With that, I can also get Wi-Fi on my phone. <TR>And</TR> that means I don't have to start the computer just to see something that is very trivial.

"1157&Wednesday, March 9th. Weather: still cold

<EV>It is nice to write in my diary in the morning.</EV> There's no sound except for some cars passing, and it helps me to wake up early.
Today is Wednesday, and in my school, Wednesday is the day in which I spend the most time at the school. There are 7 classes waiting for me today: Korean, Biology, Art, Chinese, Math, Ethics, and English. 
Being a second-year student in middle school means having more classes in middle school. I have 'History' instead of Social Studies, and 'Science' is divided into 'Biology'and 'Science'.
I have no idea whether or not a class is good or easy, but I think the teacher is good. That's enough. 
History, again, it's a problem. I'm lacking in history stuff. <TR>Especially</TR> Korean History. World History is at least fun, but I'm not sure about Korean History yet. Mom always told me to read some books about Korean History, and now I'm regretting not listening to her. Again. (Mom always seems to be right, and I am always wrong. It's depressing.) <TR>But</TR>, I'm going to try harder from now on.

You know what? There's a class that I can take starting from my second year. Teachers call it 'Advanced English' , but students call it the 'Native Speaker Class'. It's once a week, and I'm looking forward to it. The teacher's name is Caryle Vroom, and she has blonde hair and blue eyes, really blue eyes. <TR>And</TR> she seems so bright, judging from the way she talks and smiles. I really do like her. Some more information about her is that she is from Toronto, Canada, 28 years old, and 171 cm tall. <TR>Still</TR>, I don't know much about her. <TR>And</TR> I'm sure we'll have to figure it out during the class. I'm eager to take her class. 

An English book I am reading is ""39 Clues."" It's part of a series, and an interesting fantasy book. It's about two children, a brother and a sister, Daniel and Amy, who must solve their family's secret. Amy and Dan lost their parents in a fire, and they thought that Grace (their grandmother) is the only family they have left. <TR>But</TR>, with their grandma's death, the secret about their Cahill family is revealed to them, and they begin to travel around the world to save their family. They travel all around the world: China, Japan, Korea, Egypt, Italy, UK and many other countries. It's interesting to read them, so I think it'll be fun for you to try that book. <TR>But</TR>, don't read it too seriously unless you want your mom to scold you. It's fiction, and most moms don't like it when their kids read too much fiction. <CO><TR>So,</TR> just read it for fun.</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,3,::,Don't forgot your conclusion.

"1158&Wednesday, March 1st. Weather: Why I didn't wear coat today? It was foolish. Unusually cold.

As I was going to school, I blamed myself for not listening to mom and not wearing my coat. It was freezing cold. <TR>But</TR> I didn't have a choice because my friend was waiting for me in front of the Mart, and time was running out. <TR>So</TR>, I decided to just go on, which led to a whole day of shivering.
<EV>Today was my first day at school, and I was excited about going to school again and seeing my friends.</EV> I mean, new friends. First days are always thrilling. <TR>And</TR> I guess everyone feels the same way about that. 
The opening ceremony took place in the schoolyard. There is a gym in my school, but the teachers told us that it cannot be used until April. I'm hoping that this means that there will be no more cold or hot PEs. Gee.(I always disliked, but not hated, the PE class. It is really hard. I'm not really good at this.)
Anyway, the opening ceremony was a mess. All of the students talked like they just got the first chance in their life to talk, and even the teachers ignored them and let them talk. Even while our headmaster was talking! It was so rude. <TR>So</TR> the teachers just finished the ceremony early. 
After that, we went to our new class,(in my case, class no. 3) and met our new classmates and teacher. My teacher seems good. She is middle-aged and a little strict, but also kind. Mom says that this type of teacher is good. <TR>But</TR> the problem is my classmates. <TR>In my opinion</TR>, almost half of the girls and boys seem to be troublemakers. You know, the kids who disturb the mood of the class and make teachers get mad and won't let us continue the class. That's the problem.... <TR>And</TR> the type of girls, who like to spend a lot of time styling their hair and use bad words, never studying. 
<TR>But</TR>, the bright side is that those kids are only a small part of the class. Like I joked to my friend after school, if I have bad kids in my class, that means I'll get much higher grades when the teachers grade on a curve. <TR>And</TR> usually, teachers do that. 
There's nothing to worry about, it's just a little problem. <CO><TR>And</TR>, still, I believe I can make the best of it, with many good friends and good teachers.</CO>

<EV>Today, the books I bought on the internet were delivered!</EV> How wonderful!!

Due to my English books, my sister's book delivery was postponed. <TR>And</TR> she complains every minute, but I don't care. She'll stop anyway. I just told her, ""You cannot make the delivery come faster even though you complain to me"" and went to my room.

Was I mean to her? <TR>But</TR> it's just one day. <TR>But</TR> l didn't have time to think about whether I was mean or not.

As soon as I got into my room, I slumped onto my soft cushion and started reading books. The perfect light-not too bright and not too dim-and the happiness of reading a new book with hot chocolate beside me, and my room is so silent that I can even hear myself breathing. It's the perfect condition for reading books. Cozy, silent.

Oops, I didn't introduce my new book, did I? It's by Shannon Hale. She's the author of a series, and you know, she's a Newbery Honor winner. It was magnificent book. No wonder it got a Newbery Medal. I'm planning to read it again, but only if I have enough time for that. 

Back to my book, l'll write a small summary about this story. 

-When Lady Saren refuses to marry a man she fears, she and her maid (the writer of the story), Dashti, are locked in a tower with only a tiny flap open to the outside world. As food runs low and the weather changes from boiling hot to unbearably cold, it is all Dashti can do to make them comfortable in their dark prison. Not long after their confinement begins, Saren's suitors arrive- one welcome and the other less so- and she orders Dashti to speak to them. Impersonating Lady Saren is a crime punishable by death, but Dashti will have to play the role many times if she is to save them both from the tower and the dangers outside. As she takes control of their desperate situation, Dashti begins to understand her own astonishing talents and believes that even a low-born maid can find ture love-

There's a happy ending, anyway, and it's fasinating. I couldn't let go of this book until I finished it. It just didn't let me. <TR>And</TR> I spent three hours, reading and reading. I didn't realize what time it was untill I heard my mom calling me for dinner. Being absorbed in a book is a wonderful experience. It makes me feel like I'm really understanding the writer, and I could tour the world through books. Isn't that beautiful? 

My favorite kinds of books are fiction, science fiction, and novels. You can say they are just stories. And more specifically, I favor the stories where the narrators are telling the readers his or her story. I don't think I can explain very well. Okay, l'll make it simple. If the novel starts with 'I', that's my favorite kind. Hearing stories directly from the character is really fascinating and makes you feel like you are the character leading the story. I also love the 'diary' style, and-

"1160&-Script Report-

Time travel has been an interesting and mysterious topic for people. People imagined about interstellar traveling by time warp and space warp. <TR>In addition</TR>, scientists, especially physicists, started to find out the secrets of time travelling, and they discovered that the only way to travel through time was to accelerate faster than light.

<EV>Dr. Harold G. White, who works in NASA as a physicist and an engineer, is trying to find out whether humanity can time travel in the future in the floating white rounded-shaped laboratory.</EV> 

They are following the theory of one Mexican physicist named Miguel Alcubierre, who discovered faster-than-light speeds were possible, buy did not contradict with Einstein. Alcubierre referred that the machine, which gathers the speed in reality, could never be constructed. In his theory, the space has both forces: expansion, and contraction. His theoretical propulsion system controls space-time, by generating ‘warp bubble’. It is to make the spaceship to expand and contract with opposite direction.

Dr. White strongly believes that they can success the project because of their advance in their propulsion system, and they say that the ring around the warp bubble is the major key to solve the warp-travel matter. <TR>However</TR>, they do not think about making this experiment expanded because the current technology cannot accomplish the bigger warp bubble. Dr. White just wants to prove if the warp bubble exists.

There are contrary opinions about the experiment. Who assists White’s opinion are the people like Steve Stich, deputy director of engineering at the Johnson Space Center, and Richard Obousy, a physicist who is president of Icarus Interstellar. They are saying the experiment is able to succeed with longer time scale and their constant effort. Others like Edwin F. Taylor, a former editor of The American Journal of Physics and senior research scientist at M.I.T, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History, disagrees with him. Saying White’s experiment is absurd, they referred the experiment needs far-advanced technology that could be exist in the future.

Even Dr. Alcubierre himself, is telling that his theory is just, ‘theory’. By using the warp bubble, the spaceship consumes an amount of exotic matters. <TR>Moreover</TR>, as they use the warp bubble, they cannot get any signals within the ship as the ship is travelling faster than light. Ironically, pilot cannot turn it on or off either. <TR>As a result</TR>, the machine is practically impossible.

<CO>Time travel is the dream of humanity until now and for the future. For now, it is impossible to make the machine but in the near future, I strongly believe that it could succeed perfectly and humanity’s boundary will be further than present’s.</CO>",::,4,::,4,::,1,::,4,::,What do you think these theories and studies could mean for the future of the human race?

"1161&The people who are struggling to survive from the zombie virus… Get cooperation and hold back their lives!

<EV>Some of you might know about the zombie game of this title. </EV> It is presented from Valve, one of the biggest game companies in the world. Source engine is applied in the game. The engine presents smooth motion graphic and the background graphic provides basic reality and concentration of the game. <TR>In addition,</EV>, a unique game system, which uses the ‘cooperation play’, makes the game more exciting and makes everyone to unite while playing, which makes no exception for selfish game-play.

All of these components are in this upgraded engine, and it makes the game unique and interesting. <TR>In fact</TR>, Left 4 Dead 2 already gathers a lot of popularity all over the world. <TR>To summarize the plot</TR>, things all change when virus sweeps the earth. Eight characters are divided into two teams. They get through the courses to find the getaway and try to contact with other survivors such as the army of the U.S. Their occupations are varying from news anchors to swindlers. However, their goal is all the same. Surviving.

You know what? The game method is very simple. Most of the boys would know about the FPS (First Person Shooter) genre which is very simple, and the only target is to eliminate the opponent. <TR>However</TR>, what makes the game different from those is that Left 4 Dead is a cooperative game that does not exist in Korean games. <TR>Moreover</TR>, the way of cooperating with each player first came from this game. It may be exaggerated on one side, but surely, it made a strict frame of telling what makes a real cooperative game. I mean really. Helping each 4 of them, makes this game unique.

I also want to tell you about other things that stimulate your hands, which make you, cannot help but play it. <TR>Firstly</TR>, it shows a clear boundary between other ordinary zombie genre games. The zombies are distinguished in 4 ways. Ordinary zombies, specialized zombies, boss zombies, and particular zombies that only appear on certain stages. These zombies make me really out of mind, but they also make me not to be bored all the time. <TR>Also</TR>, the variation of weapons. The selections are more than 25. Each of the weapons is specialized to certain zombies. Changing weapons during the game, users don't have to worry about which weapon they are going to select. <TR>Moreover</TR>, thanks to the characteristics of the Source engine, the overall atmosphere gives us the perfect feeling of being sucked into the game. The motion, the striking sense, the background sounds make me really frightened sometimes. There is a few more things to notice but I should stop now. To quote the idiom, ‘Gaming is believing’.

The title, ‘Left 4 Dead’, is quite scary isn't it? Only four people make a team and go through charging zombies ahead… I sometimes think of the days like in this situation. 
‘What am I gonna do? Or else, if I'm gonna be a zombie?’

Maybe two or three weeks faster. <EV>Summer did not seem to stop, but eventually, the heat let up, and came refreshing autumn atmospherem</EV>.

What have you done during the summer? Did you have a vacation at the beach, the stream, or in other countries cooler than Korea? Or, have you achieved something in the summer? Got a license, participated in a competition and won a prize, or something else? Or, did you just hang around in your room all summer? I am on the latter side. Summer vacation gives us a chance to do everything. In my case, I learned high school math that I have not done but which is necessary. Maybe, however, I cannot say that I spent the vacation well. My opinion is that I think, once again, I had spent it meaninglessly which I always regret for. As I am a senior in middle school, I really want to study hard and have a goal to be the best in class. <TR>But</TR> every single time, my mind just wanders off and I do something else. When I find myself behaving this way, I just sigh and feel sorry for myself.

<TR>However</TR>, summer also gives us plenty of time to release our stress and express ourselves. Each of you may have hobbies, and if you really want to spend a lot time on hobbies, then, summer time is perfect for that. Yep, you're right. Summer indeed is hot. It may restrict you from doing things you want to and make you feel low, but summer gives you a lot time. <TR>In addition</TR>, you have a wide variety of things to do in your leisure time that could not be done in other seasons. You know, typically swimming in the beach, enjoying summer X-games. <TR>Alternatively</TR>, it would be nice just to stay indoors, if you have anything to enjoy. 

Everyone, I really want to ask you this last question,
“Have you spent your summer vacation that you really enjoyed and was fulfilling?”

<TR>However</TR>, since my family does not have ancestral rites, we just spend Chuseok with our relatives. We often meet together around this period, gather in someone’s home randomly and have meals together. We share many stories that have piled up since our last get-together.

I do not want to repeat bad outcomes again. Never.

Well, Chuseok passed without special events or stories. It just passed like normal days; the only difference is that the relatives visited our house. That’s all.

Or shall I call it an exam?

<TR>So</TR> I’ve gone through all of the tests I had to take in middle school. <TR>And</TR> by “middle school”, I mean a Korean middle school.

Let me briefly tell you about the Korean school system.
- A new semester starts in early March.
- There are two semesters (1st, 2nd) and two vacations (summer, winter) per year.
- A baby is already one years old at birth. <TR>So</TR>, anyone born in 2004 is 8 years old now. (You also grow a year older on New Years Day.)
- 8~13 year olds = 1st~6th graders = Elementary school
14~16 year olds = 7th~9th graders = Middle school
17~19 year olds = 10th~12th graders = High school

Get it?
<TR>So</TR> I am 16 in Korea, and 15 in the US (born in May 1996).
<TR>And</TR> why on earth am I explaining all of this?

- Korean
- Math
- Social Studies and History (combined)
- Science
- English
- Ethics
- PE
- Techniques and Home Living (combined)
- Chinese
- Music
- Art

I know ""Techniques and Home Living"" sounds weird! They teach you about jobs, food, basic engineering, etc. To me it is the most boring subject ever. I like English and math. <TR>But</TR> the math teacher is so tacky. Cheap red hair, honeybee-inspired striped top in yellow and brown, and finally, the most disgusting grass colored pants… eww.

I hide packets of cocoa powder in my room so nobody can use them besides me. Now my family forgot that they even existed. When everyone is asleep, which is usually sometime between midnight and 2 am, I fetch one of those precious cocoa powder packets and heat up a cup of milk. Then I blend the cocoa powder in with the milk, and wait for the marshmallows to melt. After that, my cup of late-night cocoa is good to go. Thats when I read a few pages of a book.
Every ___day (I need to censor for security. Who knows, a friend of mine might read this!) and Friday night, I commit another misdemeanor.

Not only that, pulling an all-nighter is also bad for your skin. Massive breakout! Not wanted. Anyways, guys, what should I do?!

<EV><TR>In my opinion</TR>, there is a major problem with the Korean idol fandom</EV>. <TR>First of all</TR>, I’ve never seen a country, other than Korea, in which fan girls gather and create a name for their fandom. <TR>For example</TR>, Cassiopeia, Beauty, Girlfriend, etc. And they say things like “I’m a Hottist (or Hottest, whatever), and don’t you dare criticize our 2PM! Are you insane?” Things like that bother me. Do you really have to identify yourself by who your favorite idol group is? <TR>And</TR> I even heard that there is a kind of “hierarchy” among all those fandoms. <TR>For instance</TR>, because TVXQ made their debut way before SHINee did, SHINee fans must not denounce TVXQ and their fans under any circumstance. Seriously? You guys are all just middle schoolers. Do you realize how stupid it is to fight over someone who doesn't even know you exist?

"1174&<EV>I have always been interested in volunteering.</EV> <TR>Although</TR>, volunteering for 18 hours a year is mandatory for middle school students like me, I actually enjoy doing it. There is not much to do when you are only sixteen years old. The only options are usually to organize some books in a library, clean the floor of a building, etc. They just won’t let you do something meaningful and valuable. <TR>In fact</TR>, they are already doing you a favor by giving you a chance to fill in your mandatory volunteering hours.

<TR>So</TR> I was looking for volunteer work the other day, and found out about the opportunity to be a translation volunteer. I had to become one of them! I applied for it right away. About two days later, I got a text message saying that I made it. YES! The organization is called Compassion. It's an international aid group. They sent me the necessary programs and I started translating the letters. My job is to translate Korean letters (that sponsors send to the foreign kids they sponsor) into English. After I’m done, the letters are sent to needy children in Africa, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and South America.

Sometime later I found out about the community of Compassion mates and sponsors. There, I read about a girl who sponsors two children. She is a college student who earns her living by working a part time job at a convenience store. Originally she was only sponsoring one boy. She exchanged letters with the boy and she felt sorry for the boy’s sister who couldn’t get a sponsor for years. <TR>So</TR> despite the fact that she is not so well-off and just a student, she decided to also sponsor the boy’s sister. 

I was very impressed. Sponsoring 2 kids costs 90000 won a month. It is surprising how she would pay that much money for children she never met in person. It is not only money but also her compassion and love towards the children that touched me. <TR>And</TR> I was happy that there are still people who would help others no matter what. <SR>I promised myself that I will sponsor a needy child when I get enough allowance to do so (I only get 20000 Won a month. Excuse Moi!).</SR> Anyways, I’m glad that I applied for this volunteer work and found out about this amazing girl. Thank you Compassion :)

But I was always busy. I don't know why I was so busy. Well... I really cared about doing well on the school exam though.</SR> But now?! What am I doing now? I think I should study hard again.

It is the theme song for the Daegu World Championship in Athletics.</EV> 
The World Championships in Athletics opened here in Daegu and lasted for nine days.
<EV>It was a great pleasure to be able to have and see lots of famous athletes so near to us.</EV>
The thing that attracted most people's attention was the ""curse"" of the daily program's cover model. It is very strange that in general the person on the program's cover would not do very well and receive low scores. <TR>But</TR> there were a few exceptions to the curse and some people did well even though they were on the cover and had happy faces. The most well-known and popular athlete was Usain Bolt.
But a surprising thing happened. Bolt was eliminated from competing in the final for having a false start in the 100m race. <SR>It was a sad moment for all of us.</SR> He was upset, but the next day he appeared in the exercise yard with his cheerful attitude as if nothing had happened. In the 200m race, Bolt cruised through to the final which he won with a time of 19.40s. He made his world fans laugh with
a funny movement and as always made his trademark, ""lightning"" sign. When he won the 400m relay (along with his teammates) he dance around the stadium with his teammates.
And everybody laughed. There is are also some athletes who touch the heart. The sprinter with a prosthesis leg is one of them. He is the first disabled athlete who competed in the World Championship in Athletics. He practiced a lot and didn't give up.

This is the first time I have written an English diary in a long time.
Now, let me start.
<EV>It's a problem that our economy is shaking.</EV> I read a newspaper article in the morning that explained how America's credit rating has decreased from AAA to AA+. <SR>I became really worried.</SR>
Because if America's economy suffers, it is clear that our country will also be affected by it a lot. <SR>As I had expected, I found that a lot of people started selling their stocks. This also worries me.</SR> People are busy selling their stocks because stock prices are collapsing. As a result, a CB (circuit breaker) is going on. (A CB is when there is a large sell-off of stocks. The term is derived from an incident called Black Sunday. Black Sunday was America's worst stock price collapse which happened in 1998.) <TR>Anyway,</TR> people who bought a lot of stocks are sighing and worried. I think the recent global economy is not doing well.
America's economy is suffering, along with the economies in France, Germany, Canada, and England. 
Why is every country so affected by other countries? When one country's economy is shaking, a lot of nearby countries' economies also shake with them. It is just like a domino effect.
I just hope that every country is okay and can quickly rise like a roly poly toy.
Ever since last year, there have been so many terrorist attacks and conflicts with other nations. So many people have died. <SR>I don't think it is an individual's responsibility for all of these problems.
It is all of our faults. All of us. The solution is to love each other, and care deeply about our neighbor. (Although it is very hard to do that.)</SR>
Many children are starving, and our neighbors are crying because of a lack of money.
<CO>We have to make more effort to promote the welfare of the people and make donations to the poor. If we all fulfilled this, we would live in world where everyone is laughing and happy.</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,Decent entry with but feels forced and at times disingenuine.,//

Dear my diary Pinky,

I graduated from middle school yesterday. I am so happy to graduate because it seems that I'm getting closer to college life.
I'm really looking forward to college life because I can study only what I want to study as far as I remember what my mother had told me.
I will do triple or quadruple major when I go to college. (The subjects I want to major are Interpretion &Translation, Psychology, and Management. And I'm considering Praxeology.)
Do you know why? It is because my dream was changed. Now I want to be a translator and also a manager of a large welfare facility such as an orphanage, a facility for the disabled, etc. Frankly speaking, I think I had been changing myself into what I wrote for the writing exam essay of Ulsan Foreign School. hehe^^;;... So I'm sure this dream is my real dream from the bottom of my heart this time. I'll make it come true!!kekeke
And I've also found some universities that will suit me, and where there are a lot of students like me! Jung-ang University, Seo-gang University, and so on. And... in fact, I think Korea Foreign University is good for studying Interpretation & Translation.

Now I'll just study hard, imagining my future.

I hope I can graduate from high school happily, this time 3 years later!",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,4,::,,//

Dear my diary Pinky,


<EV>There are some changes this month.</EV>
<TR>First,</TR> now, it is 2011, not 2010, of course.

<TR>Second,</TR> I started to reconnect with my pen pal, Alyssa. we had stopped exchanging e-mails with each other because we both were a little bit busy for some time. I'm always busy, anyway(ㅋㅋ).

<TR>Third,</TR> my English academy's foreign teacher has changed.
It was Weenyㅡa Filipina who has a Korean husband and a beautiful, cute daughterㅡ. <TR>But</TR> now it is Noah, who came from the USA. I think I was closer with Weeny. And different from Weeny, I can't hear the new teacher's words. He eats words! Oh, sorry, do not misunderstand, I didn't mean to badmouth him or to compare them. His pronunciation is really, really good.

<TR>Fourth</TR>, I began to be able to read English books without any dictionaries and to watch English movies without any Korean subtitles!
To be more exact, I'm reading books that are the English-language version of the Harry Potter series and watching the Harry Potter series, enjoying English English words! It was very different from the translated one in Korean!! Especially this jokeㅡnot a joke, but a jokeㅡ was impressive.
『In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when George got his ear hurt(if I heard the joke right→.) ""How are you feeling, George?"" ""Saint-like."" ""Come again?"" ""Saint-like. I'm holey.""』
I couldn't notice this joke from the translated version in Korean! <SR>I realized why people prefer reading the original one, not the translated one. Oh it was an exciting moment! I understood the joke!</SR> Hahaha! <TR>But</TR> of course there's still a lot of sentences and vocabulary words I have to learn. <CO>So I'm going to read them until I understand and know everything about English expressions again and again! 
Anyway, I'll write some more diary entries this week in a show of repentanceㅡyou know, about not writing muchㅡ~! Keke~ Good night!

PS. I think I have insomnia. These days I fall asleep past 3 a.m. (even though I go to bed a few hours before then). Oh my god, please pray for me x`(</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Entry is genuine with lots of reflection and thought.,//

Dear my diary Pinky,

<EV>These days I'm preparing not just for math but also for English.</EV>
I'm going to take TEPS every other month from now on. People say that the level of TEPS is almost the same as that of SAT in Korea. I'm studying English, watching some English.
By the way, now it is my school's winter vacation! It is from December 25th to February 6th. Oh, I am really happy to have such a long vacation~
I'm going to study very hard as usual during the vacation. I've already made Jeonghee's Winter Vacation Time Table! It has 7 daysㅡSunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturdayㅡ, and each day has its own schedule. And each schedule consists of 6 classes. Yeah, this is my plan for taking on-line lectures. And I'm going to take 6 subjects. 3 English(for each purposeㅡTEPS, the College Scholastic Ability Test, and learning about American cultures)ㅡ, Essay Writing, High School Korean, and High School Math.
And also I go to math and English academy as usual, not only taking the on-line lectures.

I have to study hardest this winter, or I might be unable to get through the difficult high school time. And, it is because this winter is the last time I will have a lot of time until high school.

Oh yeah the result of the entrance exam for high school will be announced on this Thursday, December 30th. And our high school assignments, the last week of next month, January 27th.
Some people say that a student who gets more than 150 in the exam will be assigned to the high school he/she wants. I hope this rumor is true. Because the chance of my being assigned to the high school I want is 30%, and the high school I really do not want is 70%. ㅠ_ㅜ.... I chose 2 in the whole of Ulsan, and 2 in my gu (in case of me, Buk-gu).(←I have to.) Regardless of the score on the test, 30% of students are assigned to the school they want in the whole of Ulsan, another 30%, the school they want in their gu, and the other 40%, the nearest school to their house. <SR>I don't like this system because I want to go to the girls' high school in Jueng-gu. It is not that far from my house, but for the simple reason that this school is in Jueng-gu, I have only a 30% chance to go there. And the nearest high school, I don't want to go there because many bad students in my school go there.</SR> 

<CO>Whew! <TR>Anyway</TR> I think the only thing I can do is wish for myself to be assigned to the school I want to go to! X(....</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,1,::,4,::,Details are great but self-reflection is weak,//

All our school's 3rd grade students took the test at Hyo-jeong High School, which is nearby our school, Hyo-jeong Middle School.
<TR>But,</TR> contrary to our school, we had to walk so much even after we got off at the nearest bus stop there.
So I shivered a lot while I was walking there!

<TR>Anyway,</TR> because of the standardization of high schools in Ulsan, I just needed to get a total score over about 100. As I told you before, the full marks for this test is 180ㅡOh I've just seen it and realized that I had said the number wrong, sorryㅡ.
And I got 156 on the test today!
It means that I got ONLY 24 PROBLEMS WRONG!
Of course I passed unless I marked some wrong, but that never happens because I made sure they were all correctly marked~

<SR>I feel so good today haha!
Even though it was natural that I would pass this exam, I am pleased because I AM SURE THAT I WILL pass it.</SR>

I'm studying high school math.
<SR>Now I'm almost used to it, <TR>but</TR> when I began to study it-when I first saw it-, I was really confused and worried about what I will study during my high school time.</SR>
<TR>But</TR> that doesn't mean it is very easy to learn, either.
It is much more difficult, much harder than middle school math.
If math in middle school is the basic-level information, then math in high school will be the intensive one.

Dear my diary Pinky,

One of my Catholic neighbors is in the hospital because of a serious motorcycle accident. He is a boy who is in the first year of middle school.

The terrible accident was last Thursday (as far as I remember).
At about 10 p.m., after his academy class, he was going home and waiting for the traffic light to change from red to green. And when finally it changed to a green light, he walked across the crosswalk. But then -he was crossing the middle of the crosswalk-, a motorcycle came up to him all of a sudden, in a short time, and hit him, and two men flew away in opposite directions. The poor little boy flew over 30 meters and fell down in front of one bus stop and slid over 5 meters. He had already passed out because he was hit on the head by the motorcycle. And the motorcyclist also had already passed out when he flew away and fell down. And the worst is that both of them aren't awake even now. 
According to a classmate of the little boy's, he had a tube going through his head at the hospital because his head is filled with a lot of blood that has to be taken out. Oh, I can't imagine! And she said that he doesn't even have his own face because of the sliding! Oh my, I feel so bad for this boy! I was really sorry to hear that...

Many people say that there's no hope for him because there was a lot of impact to his head.
I agree that there was a lot of impact to his head, but I think THERE IS HOPE for him. He will be able to wake up and live in his own consciousness as usual if we pray to God for him.

Let us pray to God to save him! And let us wish that he will live!",::,4,::,3,::,2,::,4,::,Thoughtful entry with adequate self-reflection,//

The 2010 World Roller Speed Skating Championship was in Colombia a few days ago.

<TR>Next,</TR> a girl played a very famous song that was in a movie called ""Howl's Moving Castle"".

And the winners of our school pop song contest sang their song.

They sang at the contest.

According to her, I have a really high and great grade!
Oh my! What a surprise indeed!
I, who was struck dumb with the news, naturally decided to do it.

The first selection phase is the application phase.
(They will screen my resume that has my grade in English from school.)
And its date is from October 15th to 19th. Wow!

And the second (final) selection phase is an interview about my career goals, the way I study, the books I read, the volunteer works I've done, etc.
<SR>How interesting this test is!!
I'm greatly looking forward to it!!!!!
Oh, I wish I could do it right now..... (I can't wait to do it!!!!!!!!)</SR>

Please give me some encouragement!
<SR>Then, I'll do better than usual heehee~~</SR>


<CO>For getting good grade in English, I think I have to go study now.
Bye-bye!</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,2,::,3,::,"The details are good, but the entry lacks self-reflection",//

Dear my diary Pinky,

I'm really sorry for having forgotten that I was one of the English diary writers.
<EV>These days I'm really busy...</EV> (Also sorry for saying the same excuse.)
Anyway that I'm here now is the important thing, right?.

My school is going to hold the 6th English Pop Song Contest the week after next Monday, October 18th.
It is a little bit earlier than last year.
You know why? This year, we will be having our school FESTIVAL!
If someone wins the first or second prize (and maybe this year third prize too), she or he can be the guest star of the English Pop Song Contest at the festival !

A friend of mine, Ye-lim, really sings beautifully and greatly,
and she has a very sweet voice. So I recommended her to compete in the contest.
But... Can you believe what she said?
She said that unless I'm going to be with her, she won't do it. Oh my!
I said, ""You can do it alone. I can't sing as well you do! If I compete with you, we will probably fail!!""
But it didn't change her mind, oh my, oh my!
She didn't even know that her voice is sweet and that her singing is beautiful!
And...
Because my singing voice is not bad, she won't change her mind, oh my, oh my!
So I gave up. (It means I decided to compete in the contest by singing a duet with her.)
And we chose the song that we are going to sing.
It is ""UpSide Down"" by A-Teens.

And I'm practicing to sing as well as she does now...ToT
...as I study....ㅠㅠ.

Oh, next Monday is my school test day!! <SR>I think I have to study harder than usual..
And I'll get a good grade so that I can enter the special-purpose high school I want to go to.</SR>

I have two important things that I have to do my best at!!!!! ㅠㅠㅠ
Even though I'm busy, I will never forget to write my diary entries every day, I promise!

Dear my diary Pinky,

<EV>Today I saw an article about one pitiful 14-year-old girl named Elisany Silva.
(In the newspaper, Hankook-ilbo, from Wednesday, September 1st, 2010)</EV>

She is 206 centimeters tall.
She couldn't even board a school bus.
Because of that reason, she couldn't help giving up going to school.
And many doctors said that she has to be treated in the hospital.
But her family is poor so her parents can't afford it.
Now, she is still growing. Don't you feel bad for her? <SR>I do.

I thought, ""I wish I had a lot of money so that I can help such people like her.""</SR>

As I read this article, I had a dream that I'll earn a lot of money (when I'm grown-up).
<CO>Studying well, I will be a great person and will be rich! ㅠ_ㅜ!!</CO>",::,3,::,3,::,3,::,3,::,Entry is written well but lacks self-reflection,//

"1216&Dear my diary Pinky,

<EV>Hey, today I took the third practice test for the entrance exam for high school.</EV>

<SR>Although I was feeling a little under the weather,
I had to go to school and take the test (because I never skip tests).</SR>


Do you know about the test?
Don't know? Then, I'll let you know.
Verbatim, this is the practice test for the entrance exam we have to take to go to an academic high school.

The full marks for this test is about 160.
And my test scores are stable.
The first test score was 142.
The second test score was 138.
The third test score was 141.
In the case of Ulsan, the cut-off line is at about more than 100.
(<TR>But</TR> this is only a guess by the students' academic ability in Ulsan.)

<SR>I really felt great when I got my score, a very nice score!
Even though I was in a bad mood before the test, and even though I didn't prepare for the test last night!</SR>
CO>Don't you think am I an amazing girl, Pinky?</CO>",::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,Entry is a little hard to follow - details could be presented better,//

Dear my diary Pinky,

<EV>I went making some unforgettable memories with my two best friends, Yeong-gyeong and Jeong-yeol, in downtown Ulsan.</EV> Before going to high school, we had to make something special for our friendship.
We were planning to go to Busan first, but my mommy said that we were too young to go to another city.. But! I still don't agree! we're already 16 years old! Anyway, so we planned to go to the beach, Ju-jeon in Ulsan instead of Busan. But one of my friends said, ""It's too hot there,"" so we finally decided to go to just downtown Ulsan, Seong-nam dong.

The appointment was at 10:00 a.m. But, one friend was late. It was no surprise that she was late. She is always shambling,, keek keek
Anyway, we first saw a movie called ""Inception"". <SR>It was really exciting!
We discussed what it was mainly talking about a lot. (Because of the strange, curious ending.)</SR>
Then we went to eat lunch. Because the movie was long, after watching the movie, we were very, very hungry. keek keek We went to an Italian restaurant and ate spaghetti. I ate oven spaghetti, Yeong-geyong ate meatball spaghetti, and Jeong-yeol ate seafood spaghetti.
And then we went to the sticker shop to take our photosticker. <SR>We were all very interested!</SR>
Then, we went to a singing room! We sang a lot of songs! <SR>It was a lot of fun!</SR>
And finally we went to a fancy shop to buy something memorable. We bought three of the same beautiful necklace. We promised not to forget our friendship with those necklaces.

<SR>I won't forget the friendship of us, the threesome girls!!!.</SR>
And also, I won't forget, no, can't forget today's memories. hehe~
Goodnight, Pinky!",::,3,::,3,::,2,::,4,::,solid entry. more self-reflection would be nice. good details and description.,//
