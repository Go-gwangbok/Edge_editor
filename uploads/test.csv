This is a generally poor essay.	//,,,"People should not be allowed to use mobile (cell) phones when they use public transportation (e.g. buses, trains, and airplanes).",::,"<IN>An intriguing topic of discussion at hand is whether or not people should not be allowed to use mobile phones when they use public transportation. The answer to this question can greatly vary depending on the individual perspectives. <TS>Thus, the jury may still be out, but as far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that employing cell phones in transportation is useful.</TS> In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my standpoint as follows. <TR>First,</TR> it helps one to relieve stress. <TR>Second,</TR> it improves work efficiency.</IN>

 

           <BO1><MI1><TR>To begin with,</TR> using mobile phones when people use public transportation can significantly reduce their stress level.</MI1> <SI1>This is attributed to the fact that when people have problems about loud noise from others, playing game by cell phones distract them from worries and stress. This simple and quick escape from stress may actually serve as a safety valve to let off some steam as well as a fun way to recharge energy. <EX>For example, there had been a study conducted by the Seoul National University in Korea. The researchers surveyed a thousand people to see if using mobile phones in subway is effective. Of all, 78.1 percent of them stated that it is advantageous for them to deal with stress. When they use public transportation, they are usually irritated by loud noise from others. <TR>However,</TR> they can effectively handle their stress by playing game, surfing the Internet, and chatting with their friends by their mobile phones.</EX> For this reason, utilizing cell phones in transportation is advantageous for people as they can relieve their stress.</SI1></BO1>

 

                             <CO><TR>In addition,</TR> using cellphones in public transportation enhances work efficiency. This is due to the fact that most of businesspeople often spend time out of their offices. Thus, employing their cell phones in public places helps them to get in touch with their co-workers, search useful information, and communicating with expertise whenever they need. <EX>According to an article, Alex Kim, the Sociology Professor at Harvard University in America claimed: “using mobile phones is useful for modern businesspeople to improve work efficiency. This is because as our society is becoming more and more competitive and fast-changing, they have to meet diverse expertise, visit other offices, and meet their clients individually, leading to use public transportation to meet other people and visit other offices.</EX> For this reason, using mobile phones is helpful for them to work in moving.”</CO>  

 

           In conclusion, I strongly argue for my standpoint on account of the two reasons mentioned above. Once again, although the verdict may still be out, I personally believe that two of my rationales are sufficiently convincing enough to represent the viewpoint of a majority of people who are in favor of my claim.",::,5,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,4,::,4,::,4,::,3,::,3,::,Overall an organized essay with some grammar mistakes.
